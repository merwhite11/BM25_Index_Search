Incidence angles of meteoroids

I've been reading the book Planetary Geology. In chapter 7, section 7.6, the author states that

The angle of incidence at which asteroids or comets encounter the surface of
a planetary body follows a Gaussian probability distribution with vertical and
horizontal collisions being extremely unlikely and the highest probability existing
for 45Â°

Why is this the case? Why doesn't the angle of incidence for meteoroids follow a uniform law? Isn't there just as much chance for an asteroid or a comet to arrive from any direction?
