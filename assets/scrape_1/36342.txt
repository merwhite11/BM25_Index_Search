60 second exposure photo with phone at eyepiece with an app produced giant ball of light, what next?

Last night I tried my first long exposure photo of M44 (the beehive cluster). While my exposure time was 60 seconds, my photos came out with a giant ball of light in the center of the photo. 
Could this be due to my set up, as I only was using a phone app and putting my phone up to the eyepiece for one minute?
