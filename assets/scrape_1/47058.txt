Half life of retrograde asteroids?

How common are asteroids that orbit retrograde with respect to the motion of all other bodies? How stable are said orbits in the Solar System, and where can we find most of them?
I presume that there are a large amount of them in the scattered disk, as they probably were ejected by the giant planets.
