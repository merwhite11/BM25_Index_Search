Is it possible for a meteorite to start a fire on the ground?

Just came across this video (which has already been debunked) where it is claimed that a meteorite caused a house fire.  (Turns out the meteorite actually landed about 200 miles away.)
Most of the video is filled with the information most of us are probably familiar with stating that meteorites are generally at ambient temperature when they reach the ground.  But a quick search for Meteorite causes house fire shows a lot of people took this seriously.
Are there any known instances of a meteorite causing a fire?  Or even theoretical analysis to say it's possible?
