Does gravitational lensing disprove the cosmic expansion theory

Recently there was a picture from the JWST that showed a galaxy that was 12.5 billion light years away. Its light had been lensed by a galaxy that was 5 billion light years away. In a static universe this would cause no problem. However in an expanding universe I fail to see how this would be possible.
My problem is that we have three galaxies A, B and C. Galaxy A is 12.5 billion light years away from galaxy C and galaxy B is 5 billion light years from galaxy C. When the light from galaxy A was passing galaxy B it was 7.5 billion light years from galaxy A. However 5 billion years ago galaxy C was also 7.5 billion light years from galaxy A.
