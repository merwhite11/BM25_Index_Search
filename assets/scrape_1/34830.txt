Was the Sun's gravitational lensing observed in other solar eclipses than the one in 1919?

In 1919 the gravitational lensing by the Sun has been observed during a total solar eclipse. Did someone observe the lensing in any other total eclipses? Last year there was a total eclipse in Chile and there were many scientists observing it. Did they see the stars in different places too? I mean, today it must be even easier to observe it with current telescopes or something. But there is no mention of any other observations than the one in 1919, is there?
