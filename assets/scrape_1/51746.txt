Can JWST see Proxima C?

I know that Proxima B is too close for Webb. But Proxima C is >1'' away from Proxima. So Webb could see it. There have been some unconfirmed images from earth. Besides there seem to be dust bands around Proxima that Webb may see too.
So is an observation of Proxima planned and when?
