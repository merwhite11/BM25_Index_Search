If the speed at which the universe contracts in reverse time decreases over time, then how did scientists arrive at a date for "The Big Bang"?

If the speed at which the universe expands is constantly increasing (just like a derivative), then the opposite must also be true: the speed at which the universe contracts in reverse time is constantly decreasing, but, never reaches zero (like an asymptote). 
If there is no exact point at which the speed of the contraction of the universe (in reverse time) reaches zero (because an asymptote goes on infinitely), then how did scientists arrive at a "date" for the "big bang"? 
Since the speed of the expansion of the universe will go on and on ad infinitum, how can one arrive at a specific beginning point of an infinite function?
