Do the axes of rotation of most stars in the Milky Way align reasonably closely with the axis of galactic rotation?

The axis of rotation of the Solar System makes a large angle of about 60 degrees relative to the axis of rotation of the Milky Way.  That seems unusual - for example, most of the bodies within the  Solar Sytem are better behaved than that.  
Do most stars or planetary systems in the Milky Way rotate in close accord with the galactic rotation?  Or is there a large scatter, so that, in fact, our Sun is not atypical?
