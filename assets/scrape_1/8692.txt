What "revolutionary" discoveries were made by Hubble Telescope

Forgive me for the naive question. Besides taking pictures of tons of objects in space, what kinds of revolutionary discoveries were made as a result of data from Hubble? Did Hubble shed light on any open problems or did it lead astronomers to conclude the existence of something that they had not known to have existed before?
