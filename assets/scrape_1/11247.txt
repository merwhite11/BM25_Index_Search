Why are radio telescopes shaped so differently than optical telescopes?

Why are radio telescopes typically only a dish with a receiver above it, while optical telescopes have a primary, plus secondary and sometimes even a tertiary mirror?
In other words, why do radio telescopes have only one reflector, while optical telescopes have up to three or more?
The same wave phenomena, such as focusing, should apply in both cases. So I don't understand why the geometry would be radically different. You could just replace actual mirrors with a convenient solid, such as plastic, that reflects radio waves just as wells as mirrors reflect optical waves.
