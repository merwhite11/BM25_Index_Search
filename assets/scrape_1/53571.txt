Bremsstrahlung's role in the sun

Due to nuclear fusion that produces gamma rays which goes through compton scattering, in the end, on the surface, visible, infrared light ends up as before then, gamma rays lost energy and became x-rays, then x-rays to UV and so on.
If we imagine radiative zone for example, we know compton scattering happens and each time, x-rays's wavelengths become bigger. Since compton scattering cause the free electrons to speed up, in this zone, there must be bremsstrahlung happening as well. So it's a little bit interesting. Compton causes the photon to decrease in energy, while increaseing the speed of free electron which in turn each time it gains more speed, would cause higher energy photon emission through bremsstrahlung. You might say these 2 events kind of balance each other out.
Question 1: It's true that from bigger wavelength, we won't be able to get less wavelength, so compton always reduces photos, but since it increases the speed of electrons each time, don't these free electrons produce full light spectrum ? and if so, photon escaped from radiative zone for example or convection zone, can be produced due to compton or bremsstrahlung.
Question 2: It's said bremsstrahlung produces full spectrum radiation, but would this be the case in the sun ? maybe not as electrons wouldn't have this much energy in the first place ? but I could argue they would as gamma ray hits it and definatey would give quite a good speed and each time other gammas hit it as well, its speed would even increase more.
