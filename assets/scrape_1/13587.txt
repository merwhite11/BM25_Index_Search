Precision of geocentric gravitational constant

I am looking for an answer as to why the geocentric gravitational constant, Î¼, defined as the product of the gravitational constant, G, and the mass of a body (earth in this case), M, can be calculated to a higher degree of precision than either G or M alone.
From wikipedia

...for celestial bodies such as Earth and the Sun, the value of the product GM is known much more accurately than each factor independently. Indeed, the  limited accuracy available for G limits the accuracy of scientific 
   determination of such masses in the first place.

Can someone explain this? I can't find a good answer anywhere I look.
