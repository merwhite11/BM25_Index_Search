What will the last days of Earth be like?

The sun is a main-sequence star; as I understand it the sun will expand into a red giant in a few billion years.  I have heard conflicting reports of what this entails - some sources I found say the sun will expand until the current orbit of Earth is contained within it, others say it will stop expanding short of Earth's current orbit.
Every source has agreed that the planet will have long-since stopped being able to support life as we know it.
Assuming humanity takes no action to significantly alter the natural course of events, such as dramatic alterations of our atmosphere, what will the last few decades of Earth's life be like?  Will the planet be heated to the point where its surface is like Mercury's sun-side?  Will the sun's output drop low enough that it instead cools, like Mars?  Will the sun expand and engulf the planet, or will the planet continue to orbit an expanded sun as a lifeless ball?
Will the sun's expansion be gradual or rapid?  How will this expansion affect the rocky planets nearest to it?
