Eta Cassiopeiae star type; G0V? F9V? Both?

For a story I am looking into the star system of Eta Cassiopeiae, which is a binary with a main sequence star called Achird (very similar to the sun) and a K7V star.
The issue I am running into is the discrepancies of what the star type is; some say it is a G0V and some say it is a F9V.
I've looked at a dozen sources so I won't link anything, but I am wondering if anyone might know the most reliable and or most current source to go off of.
