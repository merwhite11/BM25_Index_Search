How many planetary systems exist in our galaxy?

For many years scientists have studied our own solar system and modern technology allows them to look deeper and deeper into space. Knowing the Sun is only one of a few billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, I can imagine scientists also started studying other planetary systemsâ€¦ at least enough to know how many planetary systems (like our solar system) reside in our galaxy. 
Is there any information available that would be able to (at least "indicate") how many planetary systems reside in our galaxy?
