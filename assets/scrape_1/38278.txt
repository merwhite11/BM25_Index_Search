Jupiter with a mobile phone and Celestron Astro FI 102mm Maksutov

My name is John, I am new here and now that I am retired I decided to get myself my first ever telescope, why I never got one before I have no idea...probably too busy.
So I thought I would try and get some pics last night from a cloudy  Ross on Wye, Herefordshire. England. UK. Using my mobile as mentioned in the manual.
I appreciate they are not like the amazing ones here but it is my first try. I take it the large black disc is probably a reflection of the mirror? If not can you please tell me what it is. Why does this happen?
I would like to get a different eyepiece other than the 10mm and 25mm I would like a zoom can anyone suggest a reasonable one?
Anyway here are my attempts. Thanks
