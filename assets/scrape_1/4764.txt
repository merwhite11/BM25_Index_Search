What are the objects that are visible from a city?

I live in a light polluted city of the northern hemisphere and I would like to know what I can see with my Skywatcher BK 707AZ2. I have already seen Jupiter (and its moons), Saturn, Mars, M45, the Double cluster, M42 and, obviously, the Moon.
M31, M13 and maybe M33 are also probably visible, but what else?
