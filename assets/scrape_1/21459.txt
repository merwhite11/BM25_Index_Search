Contradiction of special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics

Why do special theory of relativty (with the core message of E=mcÂ²) and quantum mechanics do not go together? Why is the special theory of relativity in the quantum model not valid?
Can anyone list some reasons or explain it on examples?

Edit: The question is based on mixing up something I read. So the question is bullsh***. Sorry.
