Is this object Mars?


I decided to try the Astrophotography mode on my phone. Looking at the image I saw an object I didn't notice at the time.
What is the blue circle right of the Moon and just on the top right of the hole between the clouds?

I tried to look at a planetarium (time and location included, no idea about the azimuth). I couldn't find a planet looking at this direction.
According to this (if I understand it correctly) the only planet visible at that time and location should have been Mars.
