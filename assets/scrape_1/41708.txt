How is it possible for a collision to be responsible for Uranus's axial tilt?

I realize that the collision explanation is in any case highly (purely?) speculative, but I'm curious how it would work.  If Uranus is a ball of gas, why wouldn't any colliding object just pass through (or perhaps be destroyed/significantly damaged by the heat of friction)?  What would there be for the colliding object to hit?  Did Uranus have a significant solid mass at one time?  Is this a function of the speeds that would have been involved (sort of akin to skipping rocks on a pond, if that's a relevant analogy)?
