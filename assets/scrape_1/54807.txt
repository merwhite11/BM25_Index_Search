Distribution of Galaxy sizes (star count)

First off, I realize how hard this is to even come close to estimating, but I'm trying to get a "general feel" for the distribution of galaxies by star count. I realize everything from rogue stars to super massive galaxies with trillions of stars exist... but I'd really love to see an estimated percentage of galaxies in the observable universe with:

<10^5 stars
10^5 - 10^6 stars
10^6 - 10^7 stars
10^7 - 10^8 stars
10^8 - 10^9 stars
10^9 - 10^10 stars
10^10 - 10^11 stars
10^11 - 10^12 stars
10^12 - 10^13 stars... etc.

Does anyone know where I could find some estimates on this... Or even on galactic mass
