Could quasars be interior to the event horizon of a SMBH?

My question is prompted by suspicion of three current ideas in astrophysics:

GR predicts a singularity at the center of a BH without regard to QM.
quasar hyper-luminosity is caused by an acretion disk outside of a SMBH's EH.
the Quasar Age or Quasar Epoch has ended.

So, assume under the conditions of a unified theory of GR and QM, that there is some dynamic process occurring within a SMBH's EH that generates a hyper-luminous ball of energy. Call it a Quasar Ball, or QB. Normally, this super bright QB is shielded from a local observer's view by the EH. But, what if the observer is 10 billion light years away, and the SMBH is receding from the observer at a significant fraction, say 90%, of the speed of light? Herein lies the circumstances for my question in the title.
Could the QB on the inside of the EH of the distant SMBH now be visible under certain relativistic conditions? Most of the matter and energy of the SMBH is still compactified into a tiny central volume, but not into a singularity. So, when the central volume of the SMBH (the QB) recedes from the observer at 90% of the speed of light, does the spherical EH instantly follow right along? Or, is there a time lag for gravity to propagate across the Schwarzschild radius of the SMBH in order to form a new EH boundary. If indeed there is a time lag involved on the EH keeping up with SMBH central volume movement, then does this provide an opportunity for a distant observer to peer inside the EH? What might the distant observer see? Possibly a hyper-luminous ball of energy which we all know as a quasar? No singularity, nor acretion disk, nor Quasar Age needed.
