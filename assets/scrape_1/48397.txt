How are radio telescopes pointed?

In the past, I worked as a programmer in a radio astronomy station, and since then I have a question on my mind.
To observe a star with a telescope, we locate its location with our eyes and then we try to point the telescope using our eyes. We analyze light signals to point the telescope.
How do we do it with a radio telescope knowing that our eyes cannot discern the radio waves emitted by a star in the sky ? How can we be sure that the radio telescope is pointed at the right object? With a classical telescope, it is simple, we have our eyes but how can we be sure with a radio telescope?
