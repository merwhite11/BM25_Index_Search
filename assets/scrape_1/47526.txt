Is the satellite of a small star in a binary solar system a moon or a planet?

What exaclty distinguishes a moon from a planet?
In a binary solar system that has a large star in the center and a smaller star - among some planets - orbiting that large star, and the smaller star has natural satellites - are these satellites called moons or planets?
Or asked in a different way - if Jupiter would ignite and become a star (which it can't because its mass doesn't suffice, but let's assume it was larger and could ignite), would its moons then be considered planets?
