Could undiscovered smaller black holes within galaxies be an explanation for dark matter?

From what I've read, given the speed of stars rotating within a galaxy and the known mass, the stars' speed is too fast to stay in orbit. Dark matter was proposed to explain this but is it possible that there are undiscovered smaller black holes with no orbiting stars?
