Huge galaxies seen from earth

How do we see whole galaxies or even the whole sun? The photons of light travelling from the sun cover a vast distance, so shouldn't we only see the bit that hits the earth and the rest would be missing?
The earth is many times smaller than the sun and yet we see the whole sun. How does light carry the image of the whole sun to earth? From the same viewing position with a telescope you get greater detail of the sun. How do the photons carry all these different images, including such detail?
