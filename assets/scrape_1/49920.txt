What is Mercury and Venus’ apparent retrograde motion?

I was having a discussion about Mercury being in retrograde, and I had explained it as Earth moving faster tangentially than Mercury so it looks like it’s moving backwards when we compare it with the Sun’s backdrop during an inferior conjunction. However, I realized that Earth is never moving faster than Mercury. So, why is it that it appears to move backward?
