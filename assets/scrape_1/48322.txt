How close are we to observing all of the sky all of the time?

I was musing on how amateur astronomy is still a heavy contributor to the overall field, and how on any given night there will be plenty of small telescopes pointing into the void and capturing the sort of chance stuff the large telescopes never see because they are observing something specific elsewhere. And this made me wonder, with the combined set of professional and amateur telescopes, do we come close to seeing all of the sky all of the time?
Another way of phrasing the spirit of the question is: If some transient event occurs over the course of seconds, and is not visible to the naked eye, approximately how likely would we (meaning humans) be to notice it?
