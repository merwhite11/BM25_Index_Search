Find Periodicity in Lightcurve Using Lombscargle Periodogram(Astropy)

How to find the Nyquist factor for unevenly sampled data like here.https://github.com/jakevdp/PracticalLombScargle/blob/master/figures/LINEAR_Example.ipynb ? I have time binned for 5 mins. I mean for every 5 mins I have some count/s. The time axis is in MJD. Any kind of help and suggestions would be great help. Thank you.
