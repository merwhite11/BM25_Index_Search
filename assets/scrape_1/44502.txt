What is the sun's maximum influence on a magnetic object?

How much magnetic repulsion could the sun's magnetic field produce on an magnetic object? Consider the object is ideal: It could be flat, to create more resistance, balanced, to stay on the opposing side of the magnetic field, for propulsion, at the right distance, not to get too hot, traveling over a sun spot, and time, during the solar maximum.
