Could our Sun be the product of an ancient stellar collision?

The canonical model for the formation of the Solar System involves the gravitational collapse of a nebula into (perhaps) several stars across several light years. Is it possible that two or more of the stars (or protostars) combined to form our Sun?  Or would any stellar collision release so much energy that our Sun could not have formed the way we see it today?  Have astronomers or astrophysicists created n-body orbital models that allow for a "soft" collision of two stars combined with the ejection of the other(s)?
