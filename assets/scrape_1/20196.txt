If thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, why haven't we discovered planet 9 yet?

According to NASA, we've discovered 3,453 exoplanets so far [1]. With some of the farthest being at 13,000 light years away [2]. This would suggest today scientists have a really advanced capability for this kind of discoveries. However, the existence of a ninth planet in the solar system (which has not only been proposed but its characteristics are already predicted with great precision[3]) has not yet been discovered. If a ninth planet existed in our solar system, shouldn't it have already been discovered? How can exoplanets thousands of light years away be discovered weekly, while a giant planet right in our backyard still lays undiscovered?
