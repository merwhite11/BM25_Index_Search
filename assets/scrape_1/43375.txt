What is the significance of the velocity resolution in spectral line observations using radio interferometry?

I've always struggled to conceptualize the term "velocity resolution" in spectral observations. In principle, it is simple to calculate. For example, one can take the spectral width and divide it by the number of channels. ie. A 16 MHz wide window with 4096 channels yields a 3.906 kHz / channel velocity resolution. For an observation centered on the H1 spectral line, we get 0.82 km / s / channel utilizing the speed of light and the photon energy at the 21-cm H1 line ~ 1.42 Hz.
So, why is there a "velocity" defined in the resolution term? I understand dimensionally it comes from the speed of light, but what does the final velocity signify? Does it have anything to do with how the source moves (ie. object of interest is moving) with respect to the observer? Is it better to have a larger or smaller velocity resolution or does it depend? In general, why is the value important? Thanks in advance!
