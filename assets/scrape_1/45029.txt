When is an exoplanet called a Super-Jupiter? or Super-Earth?

Is there a recognized definition of what size an exoplanet gas planet has to be to be classed as a SuperEarth or SuperJupiter?  Is it based on radius or mass?  i.e. All gaseous exoplanets > 1 Jupiter Radii are therefore classed  a SuperJupiter?  I note on Nasa's page of type of Exoplanets they don't mention e.g. Hot/Super-Jupiters so can I assume those terms are unofficial and therefore there is no consensus?
How about SubEarths and SubJupiters?
Can you tell from the Semi-Major Axis as to whether an exoplanet is a Hot-Jupiter/Hot-Earth or does that require more indepth study than just working out the SMA?
