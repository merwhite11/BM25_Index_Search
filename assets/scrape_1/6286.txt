What is the radius of observable universe- 46 billion LY or 200 yottameters?

I have found two answers for the radius of the observable universe.  Wikipedia (and other places, including this site) say approximately 46 billion LY.  I am researching this to study for the National Science Bowl, and their question database says 200 yottameters, which is about 23 billion LY (half the size that wikipedia says). There are other places which cite 200 yottameters as the radius.  Which is the more accurate answer?
