Will we ever be able to see the surface of exoplanets directly?

When exoplanets are depicted, artist's impressions are used. The presence of exoplanets is observed by a dip in the emitted power of a star when a planet moves between us and the star (a kind of star eclipse). I'm not sure if the planets themselves can be observed let alone their appearance.
Will we, in principle, be able to see them one day like we can see Jupiter or Saturn? Light coming from the exoplanet is "scarce" in the first place. Then it diverges when it flows into space. Now scarcity is no obstacle if an object and the observer have no relative velocity. But the Earth and the exoplanet have one. The moments photons arrive correspond to different points in space. For a bright object like the sun, this is no problem, as a huge number of photons arrive at closely spaced points. But isn't this of importance for deep space objects like an exoplanet? Can we even observe them directly (by means of poton collection over time)?
Will the light coming from such a planet not be too much spread over the huge spherical surface surrounding the planet (and including the Earth)? Can we in principle see the extent of an extended object that far?
For example, "look" at the newly discovered, Saturn-like (how they know?) planet:

It's about 90 lightyears away (see this video). Will people ever be able to see it directly (from Earth)?
