Does the Schwarzschild metric solution require two (A and B, or g11 and g44) or four components (g11, g22, g33 and g44)?

Different places on the web imply that Schwarzschild's metric uses four components or separate equations, similar to how Einstein's full set requires 6 or 10, or they say only two are needed.  Is it 2 or 4?
P.S.:  Why does Friedmann's first equation only need one?  What does Schwarzschild include that Friedmann doesn't?
