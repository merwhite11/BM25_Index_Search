How are the world's biggest telescopes cleaned?

How are the world's biggest telescopes, (such as the Very Large Telescope for example) cleaned?
My research includes what I have read about CO2 cleaning here. Are there any other ways to cleaning the mirrors? What if we were talking about the (cancelled) Overwhelmingly Large Telescope?
