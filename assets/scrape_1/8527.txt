Are a black hole's jets caused by the black hole's magnetic field?

Do the jets sometimes emitted by a black hole result from its magnetic field?  It would seem Jupiter's magnetic field tends to be concentrated at the poles, and I would imagine this might extend to black holes as well.  I could see the concentrated fields near the poles accelerating particles either into or away from the black hole at high speeds.  I have included an image of Jupiter's magnetic field below:

It also appears that a black hole's magnetic field is indeed very strong:
