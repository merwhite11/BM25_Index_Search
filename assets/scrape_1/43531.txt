Astrophysical particle spectroscopy; narrow-line particle sources (charged or uncharged) for things other than photons? Have any been detected?


Is Cosmic Ray Astronomy a thing?
Is there an equivalent of the red shift effect for cosmic rays?

have got me thinking and under this answer I've commented:

That's a good point; there aren't as many energy peak-producing process for particles as there are for photons, especially at high energy. For low energies there's alpha decay and internal conversion

That makes me wonder:
