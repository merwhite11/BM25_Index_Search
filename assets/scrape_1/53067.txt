Seeing exoplanets with glare

My understanding is that the main obsracle to seeing habitable planets is glare. Right now, the best solutions are coronagraphs and proposed starshade satellites which blocks the star.
But is this the only way? We know that the glare is axisymmetric. So we can measure the intensity along a ring centered on the star. The intensity should be the same along all points. Any spike - unless it can be attributed to another star or the telescope - is a planet.
