UFO or something else?

It's 5.50 am now in Dhaka, Bangladesh.  I just saw a moving star around 5 am. It was a starry sky and that star was moving in a straight line. It was very fast, faster than regular planes (though I didn't hear any sound) and disappeared in the Eastern sky.  It was a little brighter and a little closer than the other stars. Can anyone tell, what was it?
