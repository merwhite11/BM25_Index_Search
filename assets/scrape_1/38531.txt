Apparent Centering Problem When Using the Perifocal System to Draw Orbital Ellipses

I am attempting to render orbital ellipses in software.  Given a set of orbital elements, I am using the Perifocal system to determine a set of points along the curve of the ellipse.  I am using the equation:
r = r cos(v) P + r sin(v) Q,
where v is the angle, P and Q are the perifocal vectors correspondent to I and J, and r is the polar equation of the conic:
r = p / 1 + e cos(v),
where p is the semi-latus rectum, e is eccentricity, and v, in both equations, is the angle.
I am determining the vectors P and Q using the following equations:
Pi =   cos (lan) cos (aop) - sin (lan) cos (inc) sin (aop)
Pj =   sin (lan) cos (aop) + cos (lan) cos (inc) sin (aop)
Pk =   sin (inc) cos (aop)

Qi = - cos (lan) sin (aop) - sin (lan) cos (inc) cos (aop)
Qj = - sin (lan) sin (aop) + cos (lan) cos (inc) cos (aop)
Qk =   sin (inc) cos (aop)


where lan is the Longitude of Ascending Node, aop is the Argument of Periapsis, and inc is the inclination.
This process yields the correct ellipse!  However, the ellipse does not seem to be centered correctly on its focus; the focus appears to be far too close to the center of the ellipse.  Here is an example:

You can see that these two highly eccentric ellipses have their shared center of mass at their centers - not at their respective foci.
Is there some step in my process that I'm missing?  I could just apply an offset to the ellipses, but that would be a hack, I want to solve the problem.
Any help is appreciated!  Thank you!
QUESTION EDITS AND CLARIFICATIONS:
This image is taken from a vantage point nearly normal to the orbital plane; there is almost no perspective here.
Second, a helpful user has pointed out an issue in the equation for Pk. The correct expression is:
Pk = sin (inc) sin (aop)
Unfortunately, this was correct in my code - so while the correction was a good one, it was not the source of my problems.
