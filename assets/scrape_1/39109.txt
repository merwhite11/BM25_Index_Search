How high were the tides back when the Moon was much closer to Earth?

In this article it is stated that the Moon was originally much closer to Earth at a distance of 22,500 km rather than the 384,400 km it is today. What was the height of the tides back then in meters? Surely they would've been orders of magnitude higher?
