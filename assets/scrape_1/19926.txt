How Wide is Earth's Roche Limit?

My question is simple:
Given the gravitational relationship between Earth and the moon, how wide is Earth's roche limit?  How close does the moon have to orbit before getting disintegrated by Earth's gravitational pull, and how far does it have to orbit before being free from Earth's orbit entirely?
