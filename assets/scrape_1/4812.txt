"If earth had rings like Saturn": A few further thoughts on the consequences

I came across this video recently where artists depicted what it would look like if Earth had rings like Saturn. http://www.wimp.com/earthrings/
Please note: The video contains already some information on what I ask here, but I can't assess its reliability, therefore I'd appreciate any scientific thoughts on it :)
1) Earth has roughly a distance of 1 AU to the sun, Saturn between 9 and 10. Sun's gravity would therefore have a much stronger influence on these rings. Would it already be enough to distort the rings (e.g. even leading to the sun "stealing" parts of it) or would the rings still have a ring shape?
2) How well would the objects in such rings be visible from earth? The Saturn rings are mostly dust and ice as far as I know, but there are surely some larger objects. Depending on material and size some object would probably be visible to the naked eye, right? Is there (probably yes) a formula to calculate what materials and sizes are required to achieve this?
3) Would those rings not be constantly raining particles down on earth? Would there be a much higher risk of dangerous impacts for the earth's population?
4) Are the colours used in the video precise? Don't they depend on the angle? What influence would our atmosphere have onto them?
5) Would those rings have the same orbital inclination or would theirs differ from earth's to an extent where the difference becomes visible?
6) What shadow would these rings cause on earth? Would they be dense enough to "shade out" complete stretchs of land?
I'm aware that these are hypothetical questions. But I find it, especially as an author of sci-fi and fantasy, nonetheless very interesting.
Thank you for your interest!
