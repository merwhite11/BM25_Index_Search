How am I supposed to locate the planets Uranus and Neptune with a 70 mm f/5.7 refractor?

I can locate all of the planets other than Uranus and Neptune. This is mainly because they are very dim and I live where there is just enough light pollution so that I can't spot them. I have a Gysker 70mm telescope and a camera able to take detailed pictures of most of the planets. The only problem I have run into is the fact that I can't always locate what I  am looking for. How do I locate Uranus and Neptune? How can I tell them apart from other stars that might look similar to a deep blue sphere?
