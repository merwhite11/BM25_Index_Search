What are the various ways we can quickly generate custom star charts to find moving asteroids or comets in binoculars and telescopes?

Where can I find the positions of the planets, stars, moons, artificial satellites, etc. and visualize them? is an amazing resource and @user21 has set it up with a community wiki answer for all of us to add to. It has been linked to 58 other posts and counting. While this question may not be quite as productive, I think it can benefit from that model so I'm going to suggest that the first user to post an answer consider setting it up as a community wiki which I can accept and then we can all add to, but individual answers could also be the way to go, though then I can't accept any one answer.
Question: What are the ways we can quickly generate custom star charts to find moving asteroids or comets in binoculars and telescopes?
Ideally they will have options for different fields of view, limiting magnitudes of stars plotted, and positions of planets built in, but I am also very interested in the ability to take orbital parameters from the minor body data center so that the movement of asteroids or comets will be included in the chart.
These can include downloadable programs or apps to run locally on phones or websites that make suitable plots, or packages that allow us to script the generation of such plots.
