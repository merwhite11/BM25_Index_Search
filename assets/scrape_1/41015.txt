Interaction of stellar winds in binary star systems

Binary star systems are fairly common but I am unable to find any information on how the stars interact with one another on aspects other than gravitational affects.  Using Alpha Centauri as the candidate system, what possible effects could happen where their stellar winds reach one another?
Would a cloud of magnetized gas form? Would there be a highly radioactive area between them? Could it form a sort of micro-nebula between the stars?
