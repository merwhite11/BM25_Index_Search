Missing supernovae in the Milky Way

Stars with more than 8-16 solar masses usually go supernova. These are OB stars, of which 0.2% currently exist in our galaxy. The average lifespan of said star ranges from 10 to 40 million years. So 200 million OB stars รท 40 million years = 5 per year. That's how many supernovae we should be seeing annually in our Galaxy alone. So why do we see only an average of one supernova every 50 years?
Clearly, I am not considering something else important here. What am I missing?
