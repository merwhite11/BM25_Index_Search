How do I calculate my desired distance of mirror from screen?

I plan on using flat mirror projection, among other methods, to view Tuesday's partial eclipse.
How do I calculate the distance my flat mirror has to be from my screen in order for it to cast a sharp, bright Sun image rather than its own shape or a blurred image?
