Here is supporting evidence that sun spots or material on the surface of the sun is infact si, silicon. Iron, Fe. And magnesium.
27% of earth is silicon. 30%iron and magnesium.
Please un delete my former question, could the planets be emerging from the sun, to give context to these follow up questions.
