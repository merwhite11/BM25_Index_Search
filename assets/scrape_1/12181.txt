Mountains are higher than the atmosphere?

Is it theoretically possible that planets exist with mountains so high that their peaks overtop the planets atmosphere? And which physical laws are relevant for this question? I'm just curious.
The question came while I imagined the atmosphere like a second ocean above our ocean of water. And I thought it would be nice if such a gaseous ocean could have islands as well.
