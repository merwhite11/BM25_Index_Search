Exploded star or object on earth?

I don’t have a telescope  (which is sad)
Anyways…
Usually in the city, all stars are covered by the light pollution, and that’s my case.
I stare out my window every night, but yesterday night I saw something absurd. Usually stars are not visible through my window, with all the light pollution and mosquito  netting.

There was a orb, of some sort, circled in blue.
I thought it was a meteor, but it was moving too slowly for one. I thought it was a satellite, but it was moving southward. I thought it was an airplane, but the lights didn’t resemble one, since airplane lights blink (and have different colors). So I settled on the exploded star theory. But is it really?
