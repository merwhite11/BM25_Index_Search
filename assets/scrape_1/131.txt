Is the moon moving further away from Earth and closer to the Sun? Why?

According to The NASA Moon Facts page:

The moon is actually moving away from earth at a rate of 1.5 inches per year.

Why is the moon moving further away from the Earth? Is this a result of the moons formation that set it in motion to spiral away from us? Or is this a resultant force of the gravity from the Sun and other large bodies?
