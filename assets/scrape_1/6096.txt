Estimating the tangential and cross component of the galaxy's shear using Gnomonic projection

I would like to know how I can estimate the tangential and cross component of the galaxy's shear using Gnomonic projection
of the right ascension and declination the galaxies relate to the center of galaxy cluster and estimate?
Edit. Shear is the second order moment of a galaxy's surface brightness. You can find more on the topic in the following wiki on weak lensing.
