Are there currently observed systems of close (narrow) binary brown dwarfs?

All over the Universe, there are (gravitationally bound) binary star systems. Considering the huge number of brown dwarfs, are there currently known double systems of gravitationally bound binary brown dwarfs? Given their comparatively low gravitation, how long would they need to melt together to a larger object?
What happens if binary brown dwarfs collide? Is this anyway a matter of any interest?
