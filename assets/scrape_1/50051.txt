Could the James Webb Space Telescope be protected from meteorites?

Unfortunately a meteorite has already hit the telescope and caused irreversible damage to it. I was wondering if they could have provided a cover or shield, to protect it when it is not observing. Or does it need to be observing constantly and so cannot be covered to protect it from such damage causing collisions?
