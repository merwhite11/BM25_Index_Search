Conflicting information about the star Delta Pavonis?

Delta Pavonis has about the same mass as the sun so I would think that the evolutionary path would be about the same (the mass is given as O.991 M(Sun)/ not sure how we get this so accurately). It has been estimated to be about 6.6 to 6.9 Ga with a luminosity of 1.22 L(Sun). This all makes sense if you put it on the main sequence where we will be in a couple of billion years (after T(max) in about a billion years). The problem is that the surface temperature is only 5550K (spectral) and for this reason is thought to be in subgiant phase which isn't supposed to happen to us for about another 5.5 billion years. Delta Pav also has a very high metallicity [Fe/H] of +0.33 which also screams "subgiant". What am I missing?? (data from Wikipedia sources)
