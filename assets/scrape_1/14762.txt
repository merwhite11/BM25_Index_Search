What is the first recorded reference to the Moon being a satellite of the Earth?

I saw a list recently of the moons of the various planets and the discoverer(s) and date of discovery. Earth's Moon was listed as Unknown.
I know you don't 'discover' a huge disc in the sky. But still, what is the first recorded reference to the Moon being a satellite of the Earth? That someone knew it is smaller and orbiting? Celestial Sphere does not count.
