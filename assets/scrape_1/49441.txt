How can we see black holes collapse if time inside the event horizon is infinite?

My understanding is that if you fell into a black hole, i.e. crossing the event horizon time would be speed up infinitely fast. This means I could see my whole galaxy die, new blackholes develop and collapse again and so on.
My further understanding is, that time is relative - it is based on the position of the observer.
So if I am beyond the event horizon and times flies by,how can (for example) a observer on earth look at a any black hole in the universe and see it die in his "normal" speed of time - since the time inside the black hole is infinite?
It seems like a paradox to me, and I would love some further elaboration :)
