Compton scattering of high energy radiation

I was reading up on Compton radiation, and a question came up which I could not quite answer.
Compton scattering is known to be less efficient at high energies, due to the fact that the Klein-Nishina cross-section falls off at the high energy end. This means that the Universe is more transparent to Compton radiation at high energies.
What other processes could stop high energy photons from propagating through the Universe (i.e., a process that preferentially stops high-energy photons)?
