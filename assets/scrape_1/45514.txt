Why is it safe to assume that K = 3/2kT in a self-gravitating gas

I encountered a question:
"Find the ratio of Kinetic Energy and Total Energy of a star, made out of a monoatomic ideal gas, You may not consider density to be uniform. Kinetic energy is the associated KE of gas particles w.r.t to Temperature. You may assume uniform temperature."
The solution is fine until they use $K_E = {3\over 2}k_BT$ per the monoatomic gas particle. Isn't this $K_E$ associated with Kinetic Gas Theory which neglects all attractive forces. But we have to calculate the self-energy of this star, which certainly arises due to gravitational interactions between these particles and is certainly not neglectable.
Is it a valid assumption that $K_E = {3\over 2}k_BT$?
