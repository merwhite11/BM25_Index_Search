Does precession affect this measurement?

I don't have the astronomy vocabulary to ask this question.   You can find a better picture at https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/axial-tilt-obliquity.html.
I want to know if the distance between points A & B on my graphic has a name, and if it would grow shorter or longer as the earth's rotation slows down.  Would this distance only reflect the 23Â° wobble in the rotation of earth or would it also reflect Precession of the Equinoxes.
