Can A Black Hole Exist?

In 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and other concluded that a certain neutron stars could collapse to black holes and no known law of physics would intervene.  As far as I can tell, there is no observational data that shows that an event horizon of a black hole exists.
Assuming that a black hole with an event horizon exists, then there are all kinds of mathematics that explain what is observed externally, approaches the event horizon.  It can be explained what an infalling observer sees as they approach the event horizon.  However, what happens when an infalling observer passes the event horizon, the result is a mathematical absurdity, in that the observer would observe the universe outside the event horizon as beyond "the end of time."
It seems that passing through an event horizon is as mathematically absurd as an object with non-zero mass reaching and surpassing the speed of light, as it would require more than infinite amount of energy in the latter, or more than an infinite amount of time in former.
So, can an event horizon even "exist" in the first place, if "existing" means within the bounds of any moment after the big bang and before an infinite amount of time from any point within the universe.
It seems that the existence of black holes seems to be well accepted, however faster than than light travel does not under the current understanding of the physics of relativity.
