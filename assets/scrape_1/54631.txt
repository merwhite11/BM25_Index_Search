Seen over 15 strange lights flying in a straight line

At about 9:30pm on 9/4/2023 in the Dayton Ohio area went out on the back porch and look in the sky and I noticed one light flying in a straight line across the sky and it was going at a fast speed and it had no noise and it was high but not really high not as high as a commercial airliner and then after the one passed then I looked back to the right side of the sky and there were a whole bunch of them flying in a straight line at least 15 or 20 of them flying the same exact path as the first one then when they got across the sky to the left I noticed that they didn't keep flying across the horizon it looked like they faded away I am baffled by what I have seen I been asking google questions and I seen other people have seen similar lights in a line it looked like they were in formation and the first one was the look out or the bunch was chasing the first one
