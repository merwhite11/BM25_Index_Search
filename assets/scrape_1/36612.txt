Effect of black coating on the inside of a hobby telescope's tube?

I was watching this (rather old) episode of The Making, where they show how a telescope is built in a factory. At 7:34, the cylindrical body of the telescope is shown to have a dark coating on the inside and the video explains that this prevents internal reflection of the light received from whatever you're observing.
I saw an interesting comment from Izumikawa Fukumi who asked if the telescope would become more accurate if they coated the inside with the blackest black in the world. How would such a dark coating affect the telescope's performance?
