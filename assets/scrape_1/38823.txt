How can I calculate the apparent position of stars as seen from a location on Earth at a specific time?

I'd like to be able to generate star maps using Python, similar to what is done at YourSky. I believe this is possible with Astropy and the details provided in this question. I can import stars from Hipparcos and use this tutorial to map stars using a Mollweide projection.
What calculations are needed to adjust for location on earth and time of year? Is the Mollweide projection the appropriate projection to use, or would something else be better?
