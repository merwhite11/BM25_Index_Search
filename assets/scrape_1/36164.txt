Two parallel lines of stars

Iâ€™m in New Zealand and have just seen two lines of uniform stars in parallel lines moving slowly from east and disappearing into nothing right above us. They went on for nearly two minutes before the last one vanished and were not like the star link satellites that move in one tight line from horizon to horizon, they were more spaced out and coming from far off and disappearing into somewhere above us. Also it looked like a shooting star came out of the line and one of the stars was them missing from the uniform lines. Any ideas? Thanks
