Will the lunar gateway be visible for ground based (amateur) telescopes?

Due to its low apparent magnitude and large apparent diameter, astrophotographers have managed to capture the ISS not only during solar and moon transits, but even come so far as to image individual astronauts on their spacewalks on its surface as it passes overhead during sunset.
The Lunar Gateway will be much further away - about a thousand times - will it still be possible to track it with (amateur) telescopes (considering both visual observation and imaging)?
