I am bit worried about the telescope, since I heard somewhere that the next (robotic) mission which will move the telescope to its burning fate in Earth's atmosphere. I learned that there has even been a hook installed during the [last Space Shuttle mission[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-125) for that purpose. I am now hoping that somebody can point me to more details on the payload computer and its role for astronomy.
