Can "rock stars" form from interstellar dust?

Imagine a large and massive dust cloud made of solid phase micrometeoroids, asteroids and larger planetoids, all material in it is in solid phase, and contains no hydrogen or other volatiles in gas form - think about the chemical composition of inner solar system asteroids.
Can this debris cloud collapse and form a star that fuses the lighter than iron elements? What properties such object would have? Would it be very hot? Very cold?
Nowadays it's unlikely, but I can imagine situations like this near the end of the stelliferous era when most of the hydrogen is used up and the universe is filled with white dwarves, neutron stars, and black holes, and lots of dust from all the previous explosions of the supernovas and planetary nebulas of the last hydrogen stars.
