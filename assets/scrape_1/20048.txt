Observing Comet 45P - reliable sources of position data

Yesterday night I have tried find comet 45P, that should be still easily visible with my equipment at hand, however I was unable to find it.
I used data provided by this website.
Today I've checked the website's data against the Minor Planets Center's data loaded into Stellarium (the program) and found the predicted positions of the comet to differ by more than 7Â°. That is totally unacceptable when trying to find the comet with a FOV of a few tens of arcminutes (the finder presumably is too light-weak).
So does anybody know a definite, reliable source for the position data of 45P? I'm gonna try again today anyway with the positions provided by Stellarium, but it might be good to have another alternative.
