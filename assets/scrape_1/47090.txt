Logically, how can the universe be infinite in size?

Many people have told me that the “universe doesn’t care what you think” in my regards to it being infinite in size, and I know something that seems logical doesn’t mean anything when measured by physics yet I don’t see how the universe could be infinite and yet constantly expanding. I believe it is constantly expanding but something that is infinite in size cannot be measured and you cannot just say it is now Infinite+1 and Infinite+2. Infinity is infinity. If the universe was infinite it wouldn’t need to expand anymore. It’s as big as it ever could and will be in that case. Also the universe cannot be infinite because if it was truly infinite, every possible occurrence would have happened. Six septillion miles away, there might be a planet that figured out FTL and possibly we would have seen some aliens by now. Finally, if something was infinite in size; it would have no beginning and no end. It would simply be. Yet the cosmic background radiation proves that the Big Bang probably occurred at some point within ~20 billion years ago. Yet many of the brightest minds, Einstein, William James Sidis believed it was infinite in size. Why do people think this?
