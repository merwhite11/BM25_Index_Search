How does the earth not continue accelerating?

I'm not scientist at all so the answer might be obvious but I was pondering about the big bang. I started wondering how is it possible that the earth had to accelerate at some point in history to the speed it currently has but not continue accelerating past it? Isn't acceleration infinite out in space?
