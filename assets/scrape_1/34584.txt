Astronomical events and Celebrations

In the past people celebrated important astronomical events and some of those events are still celebrated in some cultures and traditions. 
For example: March/September equinox, New Moon, Winter/Summer solstice. 
I am looking for a list of astronomical events that people celebrated in the past. Do you know any other important astronomical events that were celebrated in the past?
