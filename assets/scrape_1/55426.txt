What were these lights in a line in the sky?

Hello dear astronomy community,
On September 7 at 8:00pm me and my friend were hiking towards the Hollywood sign. We noticed roughly 10-15 bright lights moving in a line on the sky. That was very confusing to me, as I've never seen that before. They were due North East from us. As per this question, it was most certainly an artificial satellite. But is it possible to find out which organization launched them?
I tried looking here https://www.rocketlaunch.live/?pastOnly=1. No launches at that time.
Thanks!
