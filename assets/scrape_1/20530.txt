At what wavelengths can black hole Sagittarius A* be observed from Earth?

The supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way is blocked by dust and gas clouds as seen from where we are. Which wavelengths are blocked and which are most undisturbed for observation of Sagittarius A* and its immediate neighborhood? Does the matter between us change for example polarization at some wavelengths or cause disturbances other than blocking the light? Could galactic cosmic rays, heavy ions, from it be detected if they were emitted, or would they be deflected by magnetic fields?
By the way, at what distance from us is the most dust located? Is it concentrated in one region or are there several dust clouds in the way?
