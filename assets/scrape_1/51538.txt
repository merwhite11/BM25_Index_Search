Is it possible to watch both annular and total eclipse at the same place?

I read that some rare eclipses are hybrid, where it can be annular near the beginning and/or end of its journey over the Earth's surface, and total in between. That begs the question, if a person is in the right place, can they witness both? Since the duration of a total/annular never exceeds a few minutes, I guess even if it's possible, the transition between 2 states will be very short.
Has anyone in the world ever seen both states in 1 outing? Are there photos of the event? Theoretically, can we calculate the typical area of the strip of land where both can happen? Is it possible to find out about that in our normal media coverage (i.e. the internet for non-experts) of eclipse?
