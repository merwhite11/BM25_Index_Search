Why do we have so few neutrinos to study?

According to Wikipedia most neutrinos passing through the Earth emanate from the Sun. About 65 billion (6.5^10) solar neutrinos per second pass through every square centimeter perpendicular to the direction of the Sun in the region of the Earth.
However the IceCube Neutrino Observatory or other neutrino detectors only detect a few neutrinos every year. Why?
