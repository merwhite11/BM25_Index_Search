Will I get a job in aerospace field after graduating from M.Sc in astronomy and B.Tech in aerospace engineering?

I am a student of class 12. I am fascinated about space and rockets. I want to be an astronomer and I know that I have to get a B.Sc, then M.Sc, and then Ph.D in astronomy. I came to know that there are less opportunities for research in astronomy, since many organizations like ISRO not only employ scientists, but also employ engineers to make satellites and spacecrafts. Can I get a job in aerospace field after doing my M.Sc in astronomy?
