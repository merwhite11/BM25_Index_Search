What celestial mechanics parameters define a lunar occultation of Venus visible from Earth?

As a carry on from the following thread
Are lunar occultations visible to the naked eye?
Is it correct that the following parameters must hold true if we use Moon occult Venus as an example

[LongMoon = LongVenus = RAMoon = RAVenus] AND [DECMoon = DECVenus]
Moon and Venus must both be visible, i.e. not too close to the Sun

I expect both of these events will need to occur above the horizon (ascendant) for the location right?
Am I missing anything? Are there agreed parameters for degrees above the horizon for visibility?
Like eclipses, such events wont be observed everywhere on earth. Is there an orb convention that captures when occultations can be observed on earth? Is there a way to identify where on earth the total occultation can be observed?
Thank you for any guidance with this.
