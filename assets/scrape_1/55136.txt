What is a good book to learn about the fall of Geocentrism?

I want to read about the paradigm shifting from Geocentrism to Heliocentrism. I am looking for a book which explains all of the details in a way that someone without so much astronomical knowledge can understand. Are there any good recommendations?
EDIT: I am more interested in the physics than the politics of the issueâ€¦
