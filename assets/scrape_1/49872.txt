How did NASA choose "James Webb" as the name of the telescope?

How did NASA decide to name the telescope "James Webb" and not some other name like Copernicus or Ptolemy? The wiki page mentions controversy over the name in the past couple of years but nothing on how the name was chosen in the first place. I.e. was there some sort of a vote to choose the name? If so, were there other candidates for what name to choose?
