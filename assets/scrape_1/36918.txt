As the Moon and the Earth are predicted to get into tidal lock, how slow would the Earth rotate?

This answer to Will the Earth ever be tidally locked to the Moon? supports the widely held thinking that during the Sun's red giant phase or later the Earth and the Moon should be tidally locked to each other. The Earth is said to have a slower rotation then.
Do we have any idea how long a sidereal day and the mean solar day on Earth would be in several billion years?
