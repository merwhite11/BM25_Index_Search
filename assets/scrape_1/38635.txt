What does "located in the Hubble flow" mean?

I do not understand that much about the term Hubble flow.
For cosmological studies with type Ia supernova, I often see the sentence like "We used 100 SNe Ia in the Hubble flow". What does the difference between "located in the Hubble flow" and "not in the Hubble flow"? Thank you.
