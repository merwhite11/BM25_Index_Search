Has any astronomer/physicist used geometry and trigonometry to calculate where the center of the universe is?

Since we are pretty sure that the universe is expanding at a steady and accelerating rate wouldnâ€™t it be possible to simultaneously observe 4 points (galaxies) that are all, as closely as we can tell, at a similar distance from our reference point to triangulate back and find the beginning point or location?
