Are there any softwares which help in simulating different experiments regarding flight of aircrafts on different terrestrial planets of solar system?

I have a few experiments on aircrafts whose results I am aware of if performed on the earth's surface. However, I am searching for software(s) that can help simulate the same or other experiments on other terrestrial planets of the solar system too. Is/are there any such software(s) that can help me in this process?
