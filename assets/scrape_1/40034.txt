Do space objects stay in orbit once they get sucked in? Can they escape?

Think of my question with respect to 2020 CD$_3$ minimoon that's been recently discovered.
If an object gets caught into a planet's orbit, can it ever escape it?
Obviously it may escape on the first pass without making any full revolution.
But if one or two revolutions took place, can it ever escape the planet's orbit on its own momentum it came in with?
