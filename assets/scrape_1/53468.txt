Why do cosmologists assume that inflation began shortly after the Big Bang, rather than at the exact start?

Somehow, I have never come across an explanation of why cosmologists claim that the alleged inflation of the very early universe occurred not at the Big Bang, but very shortly afterwards (~10^-36 to 10^-32 seconds afterwards)....
Why?  What difference does 10^-36 seconds make?
