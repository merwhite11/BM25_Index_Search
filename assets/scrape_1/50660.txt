Could we use the future dead core of the sun with Jupiter to create another sun?

5 billion years from now the sun would be dead and the solar system would be in darkness. :(  But what if in 5 billion years humans would be advanced enough to move the dead iron(EDIT: I meant carbon) core of our sun, and place it at the center of Jupiter.  Would the mass and gravitational effects of the dense core of our sun would be enough to start fusion of Hydrogen on Jupiter, and thus we have another sun?  If not, what type of comparable extremely dense object would be required to be placed in the center of Jupiter, to cause it to start nuclear fusion due to temperature increase due to gravity?
