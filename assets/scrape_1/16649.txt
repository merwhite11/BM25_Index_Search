Can I get help getting image of Celestial Body at RA 2.220 and Declination +15.59?

My mom had a star named for my dad who died a few years back.   I told her that I'd try to find an image of that star and send it to her.  My dad's Birthday was 3/31/1931 if that helps.  Would love some help with this.  Thanks so much, in advance.  :-)
