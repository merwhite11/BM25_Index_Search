In what parts of the world is it impossible to view the night sky due to light pollution?

Growing up far from any city, I have always been able to view the full night sky. It was just the way how things were. Of course, I knew that light pollution is a thing, and that the sky is a lot less clear if you live in a city.
It just never occurred to how bad it was before talking with people who had experienced it.
Apparently:

Inside a city, it is pretty much impossible to view anything.
It is not a lot better just outside a city, the sky is still mostly empty.
Most of Europe, parts of the US, India, and eastern Asia is so polluted with light that you can not see the Milky way.

Does anyone have a map showing the affected area? How many people have never seen our own galaxy?
