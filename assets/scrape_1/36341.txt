Which Barlow lens should I choose, 2x or 3x?

I recently bought a 6-inch reflector, 750 mm focal length and I want to get a Barlow lens to get better observations. I have 2 eyepieces, one 9mm and one 25mm. 
My question is:

Should I go for a 2x Barlow with the 9 mm eyepiece (167x magnification) or 3x with the 9 mm (250x magnification)? 

I know that a 6 inch can handle about 300x. Is the 3x Barlow too much or is it suitable for what I currently have?
