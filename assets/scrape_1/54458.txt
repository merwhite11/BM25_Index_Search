Trying to identify what I saw in the sky

This occurred at around 12:45 AM on Saturday August 12th somewhere in the center of Nantucket Island Massachusetts. We were trying to spot the Perseids meteor shower when I noticed a strange green thing in the corner of my eye. I could only se it in the corner of my eye for some reason because anytime I tried looking at it directly it disappeared. I took out my binoculars to try and see it and all I saw was six greenish lights looking like they were entering the atmosphere. Anyone know what this may have been? Or should my entire family see the eye doctor?
