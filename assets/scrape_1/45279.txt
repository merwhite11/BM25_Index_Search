Uncertainities of orbital elements queried from JPL Horizons

I'm trying to retrieve the orbital elements' uncertainities for asteroids queried from NASA JPL Horizons. However I'm not able to find them in the query fields returned in python. Nor am I able to find any reference to individual uncertainites of respective orbital elements in the Horizons website. The desired uncertainites are to be used later to populate a clone of particles for an orbital integration simulation.
This seems to be straightforward, but I'm probably missing something.
Any ideas and help highly appreciated.
Thanks !
