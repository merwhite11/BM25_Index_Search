Will these simple 2 convex lens arrangement telescope see the moon clearly?



Hi readers, I am planning to build my telescope. Does this very simple 2 convex lens arrangement even possible to observe the moon clearly with high magnification? I am planning to buy 5 cm diameter convex lens with 10cm focal length. What further modification should I make to enhance its quality?
