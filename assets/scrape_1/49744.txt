Slow moving pulsing light

I was looking at the stars as it was clear tonight. I saw a slow moving and slow pulsing star like object. It moved across the sky turning on and off a ‘light’ only being visible when lit and it was less bright each time until I didn’t see it again, it lit up around 4 or 5 times. My best guess is  a satellite reflecting the sun but I’m clueless if I’m honest, I hope someone here can give an explanation.
EDIT: as suggested the date time and location of this sighting are as follows,3 July 2022, time was approximately 23:45/00:00 as i created my account to post about this, as for location I have these coordinates 52.896139,-1.329746
