How do we know that a comet passed by earth 50,000 years ago?

This article (https://gothamist.com/news/a-green-comet-is-sailing-over-new-york-and-earth-for-the-first-time-in-50000-years) claims that a comet will pass by earth soon for the first time in 50,000 years. How do we know that this exact comet passed earth 50,000 years ago? It obviously was not a recorded event at the time so how can such a claim be made?
