Are there any common characteristics of habitable planets?

Recently, over a thousand exoplanets were confirmed in one huge sweep which is a huge achievement and in the mix a dozen or so possibly habitable planets were confirmed as well. This made me wonder, Are there any common characteristics of (possibly) habitable planets? If so, what are they? Could scientists use these characteristics to locate them? Or are they using these characteristics already?
NOTE: Answers can be theoretical as well!
