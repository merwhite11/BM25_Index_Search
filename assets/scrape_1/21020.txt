very bright white star before sunrise

I'm from the Philippines, this is the first time I've seen such a bright star. I don't normally see stars at all cause of my poor eyesight but this star is very bright and really noticeable. 
I took the first picture around 4:45 am, then now the little white which is still the star. The second I took it around 5:15 am when the sun already rising. The star and the sun are both in my east. The star is like going up while the sun is rising.
