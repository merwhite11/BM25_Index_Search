Can somebody explain heisenberg uncertainty principle to 14 year old me?

I'm a young student that's very curious about physics and especially some physics theories. I've watched a TED video about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, but I couldn't fully understand it and I'm looking for a fairly easy explanation if possible.
