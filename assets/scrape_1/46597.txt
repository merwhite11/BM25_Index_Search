Has Altair flung off its planets by rotation?

This might be a dumb question, but would it be possible that during the star Altair's formation, the centrifugal forces became so large that its planets were flung away into space?
Or could a passing object have snaked the planets from Altair and simultaneously increased its rotation rate?
It's an odd coincidence that one of the few close-by stars that don't have exoplanets that we can detect rotates so swiftly.
