Do the earth and the moon reflect the different fractions of total solar radiation proportionally?

Reading on this website that: "All of the energy from the Sun that reaches the Earth arrives as solar radiation". "Solar radiation includes visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared, radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays".
Here Albedo is explained to refering to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.
The earth and the moon obviously reflect different amounts of total solar radiation, but question is if they reflect the different solar radiation fractions proportionally?
(Proportional reflection is when all the different light spectrum fractions increases, or decreases, with the same percentages.)
Or do earth and/or moon reflect light dis-proportionally?
Rephrasing the question:
We know how much the difference in visible geometric albedo between earth and the moon
is, but is that figure the same when comparing  reflection of infrared, or any of the other parts of the light spectrum?
