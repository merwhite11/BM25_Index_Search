Do origin theories imagine each planet to first orbit the Sun very irregularly before stabilizing?

What I was wondering is that, for example, toss a few balls into zero gravity space randomly, what would be the steady state motion?   Would not all the balls go on weird directions and undergo irregular orbits due to the interacting and irregular gravitations. I imagine the largest or more dense planets to begin to influence the smaller and eventually it would stabalize.  Is this what origin of the universe theories imagine, or am I totally missing something here? Would the smaller ones eventually all rotate around the largest? All in the same plane, more or less, and all in the same direction? It seems possible but I have no idea if this is mathematically derivable.
What are theories that explain chaotic motions into the present, same plane, same direction planetary orbits around the Sun?
