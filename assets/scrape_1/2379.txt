Red cresent moon

Yesterday night i witnessed something very strange when i looked outside the window. I saw the moon (crescent) but it was dull red and right on the horizon ,which is strange considering that it is usually on the upper right of the night sky and white in colour. On further inspection with my binoculars i noticed it was lowering down until it was hidden by the mountain range (5km away) next to my building, this all occurred within a few minutes (about 5).
Tonight i saw the moon (crescent) had again returned to its normal position.
Please explain the cause for this, i'm completely baffled!
(Sorry for the poor wording, i'm not familiar with all the astronomical terms!)
