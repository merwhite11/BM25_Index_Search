What is that stuff around Andromeda Galaxy

I know Andromeda Galaxy is one of the closest galaxies to our Milky Way, but there are photographs showing it to be surrounded by smaller bodies. Are there any that are closer, or are they all farther away. I am guessing that the smaller looking galaxies are all farther away, but there is a wide variety of sizes. What distance range do we see surrounding Andromeda Galaxy.
