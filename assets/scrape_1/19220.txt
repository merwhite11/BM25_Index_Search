How can clouds form in Jupiter's atmosphere of Hydrogen and Helium?

Here is a graphic of cloud layers of Jupiter (source: Wikipedia):

There are three distinct cloud layers of ammonia, ammonium hydrosulfide, and water. The temperature and pressure conditions seem to be surprisingly earth-like; temperatures between 200 and 300 K, pressures about 1 to 10 atm, gravity around 1.3g.
Clouds (of water) form on earth because they solar energy causes them to evaporate from a solid surface, rise a few km, then condense to form water droplets (or solid crystal snow). But Jupiter does not have a solid surface, or nearly as much solar energy as the Earth.
All three of the cloud forming compounds should be liquid at the conditions of their cloud layer. Given the density of those liquids (between 0.7 and 1.2 g/cm$^3$) and the density of the bulk of the hydrogen and helium atmosphere, how do the clouds not fall as precipitation into Jupiter's interior and never re-emerge?
