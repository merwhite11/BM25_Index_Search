Are stars really "burning balls of gas"?

Even the NASA website refers to stars as "big ball of gas". It's a common statement that's popularized by movies and popular culture. However, stars are technically not in a gaseous state - they're in a state of plasma.
So do stars qualify as being made of "gas" as the proverb would suggest, or is that considered a misconception?
