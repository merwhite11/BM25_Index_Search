Earth’s rotation speed vs rate of lunar cycle

Hypothetical Question
If the earth’s rotation slowed down to align to the lunar cycle so that the orbital period began and ended at the same lunar phase, what other things would result?
For example, take the orbital period as exactly 360 earth rotations.  The rotation would have decelerated. Would the speed of the lunar cycle also change, and by how much?
How might a change in rotation speed effect the orbital period?
How would all that be estimated?
Thank you!
