Is or might there be lightning on Io?

As far as we know, Jupiter's moon Io has the most volcanic activity of any known celestial body. It has the most volcanoes that are active and they're erupting frequently. On Earth (the third planet from the Sun) there's lightning during volcanic eruptions and on Venus (the 2nd planet) there's lightning too, probably also during eruptions. Has any lightning ever been detected during an eruption on Io, or isn't it possible for lightning to occur during eruptions on Io for some reason?
