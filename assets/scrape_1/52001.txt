Is "monochromatic source" different than "monochromator" in astronomical instrumentation?

I got a comment to replace "monochromator" by "monochromatic source" for a paper on an astronomical instrument. The latter seems less specific for no reason.
Is there an agreement to use one term rather than the other in the context of astronomy?
(I have found no evidence for this but I may have missed something significant)
