"Holes" discovered in the Milky Way Galaxy

Recently I read that Astronomers have noticed a few "holes" in our Galaxy. They are about one million times the mass of our Sun. They are baffled as to what could have caused this and speculate that perhaps it was done by Dark Matter. My question is, what happened with any Stars and Planets in this region ? Would they have been pushed aside or destroyed by this event ?
