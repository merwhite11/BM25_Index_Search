Wouldn't our own EM emissions be hiding the best places to look for signs of intelligent life?

I read that only a narrow band of radio waves are reserved for astronomical observation, and humans emit all sorts of electromagnetic waves, which leads to my question:
Could there be signals of advanced life lost in the chaos of all the other EM bands we emit on? We haven't been listening for aliens as long as we've been blasting out waves, and any far off source would be very quiet, so are we potentially drowning signals out?
Aren't the bands we specifically use the ones most likely for other civilizations to be emitting on?
