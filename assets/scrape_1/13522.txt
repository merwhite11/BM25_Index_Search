Is there sufficient evidence to confirm additional Planet in solar system

I have watched this scishow episode where Hank says that astronomers believe there is another planet in our solar system.

He says that it's because how asteroids and comments are being pushed towards the sun (and us) from similar angles. Is this true? Do astronomers really have data that confirms the 'new ninth' planet?
EDIT: I did read the other related answers and articles, the way I understand this theory explained by tilt of 6 objects that could be explained by something massive enough pulling them. My question is do astronomers believe this is sufficient to confirm it that there is a planet.
