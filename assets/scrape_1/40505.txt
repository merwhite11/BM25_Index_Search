Question about telescope eyepieces

I have a Celestron 60LCM refractor telescope. It has a 60mm aperture and a 700mm focal length. It came with two eyepieces. One is 25mm and the other is 9mm. They are marked only with their focal length - there is no brand name or part number printed or stamped on either. I can view Jupiter and Saturn through both eyepieces. However, even though the 9mm should have a higher magnification, the planets actually look smaller when looking through it than they do when viewing them through the 25mm eyepiece. Is this a field of view issue? And if so, what field of view should I look for when I shop for new eyepieces for viewing Saturn and Jupiter?
