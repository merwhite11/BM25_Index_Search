How to show that a complete revolution of Earth around the sun takes 365 1/4 days?

Seasons change regularly and day and nights also.
The fact that Earth takes 365 1/4 days to complete one complete revolution was found a long way back in history, but so far I can't find any current measurements showing this to be so.
For an average person in daily life, how can I prove that the time it takes to complete one revolution of Earth around the Sun is 365 1/4 days?
