Would our galaxy appear as a spiral when seen from the Andromeda galaxy?

I'm wondering how our galaxy is tilted with respect to the Andromeda galaxy.  
Seen from the Andromeda galaxy, what would our galaxy look like?  
Would it appear as a spiral, or would it be seen edge-on, and appear long and thin?
