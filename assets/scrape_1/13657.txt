Why is it said that the far side of the moon's crust is thicker?

This video states that NASA has determined that the far side of the moon's crust is thicker than the near side's crust. How did they determine this?
Please note I'm not asking for theories or hypotheses on how this came to be, but rather if the difference in thickness indeed is measurable scientifically today.
[So off-topic: If it is in fact true, I favour the theory that the centrifugal force of the earth's gravity along with the fact that the far side is always pointing outwards, is responsible for this and not some other moon smashing into our moon etc. as is shown in that video.]
