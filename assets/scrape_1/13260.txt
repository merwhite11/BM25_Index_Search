Why do PMS stars on the Hayashi track remain at a constant temperature while they contract?

Why do pre-main-sequence stars on the Hayashi track remain at a constant temperature while they contract?
I've read the Wikipedia article, so no need to repeat the derivation.
What I took away from that is that the extra heat generated by contraction is given off almost exactly because the whole star is convective and the atmosphere is very capable of radiating that heat away if the opacity is mainly caused by hydrogen ions, which is the case in the cooler of the pre-main-sequence stars.
Is that correct?
