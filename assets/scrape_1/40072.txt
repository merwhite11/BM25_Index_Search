Difficulty in using the telescope as a projector

I have been trying, but completely failing, to copy the arrangement for viewing the sun mentioned on this website:  https://astronomyconnect.com/forums/articles/2-three-ways-to-safely-observe-the-sun.21/

The telescope shown does not appear to have a finderscope or any other obvious means of finding/tracking the sun.  This set up is actually far harder to do than it would appear in the photo.  However, I think it is worth the effort as it doesn't risk blinding the observer.
Finding the sun is not our issue because our telescope moves.  We punch in what we want to look at and the telescope moves there.   We can use it manually, but have found that the sun is surprisingly difficult to find without looking through the finderscope.   We are not willing to do that for obvious reasons.
I have been trying to figure out a way to have the board portion grab hold of our telescope instead of set on a table.  So when the telescope moves, the board moves with it.  Orion does sell a sun-filter, which I have purchased, but I am not willing to set a precedent with my homeschoolers where they look at the sun through the telescope - even with a sun filter.
Does anyone know of another website with instructions to use the telescope as a projector that uses a telescope similar to mine?
