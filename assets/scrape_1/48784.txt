I dont know how to properly search in SIMBAD

I've been trying to search in SIMBAD for a star in about 92 parsecs,
there is a problem. I dont know how to properly search,
I got confused with the query search with those bazillion codes, and every time i try to search by how i think it would go it only says
Lexical error at line 1, column 19. Encountered: "9" (57) Distance.distance 92 pc
and the guides do not help at all, I want ot search a concrete list of stars that area in a 91-92 parsec distance from sol, Other resources for me were very limited
I need help
