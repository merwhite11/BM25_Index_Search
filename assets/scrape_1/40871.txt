Are there any stars that orbit perpendicular to the Milky Way's galactic plane?

Most stars orbit in the Milky Way's galactic disc. But is it possible for one to orbit perpendicular to it?
Here on Earth since we're inside the galactic plane we can't get a good view of what the Milky Way looks like. But would the whole Milky Way be visible from a planet orbiting such a star?
