What (actually) is Jupiter doing to this year's Perseids meteor shower?

After reading the Astronomy Magazine article Perseid meteor shower set for its best show in nearly 20 years and NASA's Look Up! Perseid Meteor Shower Peaks Aug. 11-12, I understand that Jupiter's gravity is affecting this year's possible peak rate of Perseid's meteors. 
I think it is - in simple terms - deflecting some of them out of their general orbit, a bit more towards earth, so that we intercept more than usual. But I am having difficulty visualizing this. Is this deflection in the plane of the ecliptic, or out of plane? At our closest approach, how far away are we from the orbit of this dust?
A good diagram would really help!  I found this at space.com credited to Jeremie Vaubaillon, but it's not helping me with the 'big picture'.
