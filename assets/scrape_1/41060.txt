Observatories with public access in Europe

This is a follow-up to Observatories that allow public access with a smaller (geographical) scope.
I am interested in getting to know observatories in central Europe (e.g. France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Austria) where you could could go with a class of school children or university students.
Maybe you could add more entries to my list, please?

The Effelsberg radio telescope has a visitor programme.
The Heidelberg observatory has some outreach programme, but is close to a city with its lights.
Similar problems with light pollution has the Paris Observatory.

I tried to find some European website with such a list, but I was not successful yet.
