Gamma Ray Spectroscopy in detecting hydrogen

My professor explained saying that bombarding the surface with cosmic rays breaks off a few neutrons from nuclei and the nucleus, having undergone a change in energy level, emits a gamma photon. The neutrons thus emitted are typically of two categories- the fast-moving ones that have undergone little or no interaction with other nuclei, and thermal neutrons that are much slower. Apparently measuring the ratio of fast-moving and thermal neutrons tells us a lot about the surface. 
He went on to say that a low value of this ratio indicates the presence of lighter elements on the surface, particularly hydrogen. (Basic mechanics tells us that momentum transfer is maximum if the colliding objects have the same mass). This technique, he says, has been instrumental in detecting the hydrogen in water present in the Southern polar caps of Mars.
1)The hydrogen in water is not free. When the neutron collides with water, it collides with the water molecule as a whole, not just the hydrogen atom. This is no different from colliding with a heavy atom of the same mass. In that case, the neutrons shouldn't slow down much, at least, that's what I think. Help?
