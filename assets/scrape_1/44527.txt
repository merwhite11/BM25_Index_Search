Can Quantum tunneling be possible within Blackhole ? And if so, could that be the source of Dark Energy?


Quantum tunneling starts happening when there are empty energy states available for the electrons to occupy and the energy barrier is of the order of the wavefunction of the electrons.
Could there be exotic particles much smaller than electrons inside the black hole ?
If so, then the applying the same principle of available empty energy states outside of the blackhole, the 'exotic electron' can just disappear from within blackhole.
Also, it would not really emerge as a 'particle'. Since, blackholes are so efficient at converting the mass to energy -> It would emerge as Energy
And could this be the source of Dark Energy that is ripping the universe ?
