What is the current routine of modern astronomy?

With about all visible stars catalogued, measured and photographed it seems that chapter is closed. I realize currently while amateur astronomy is big on cataloguing all asteroids in the Solar System, the "Big Boys" are now primarily busy with discovery of extrasolar planets. But that's certainly not all. Sure there's a lot of unique research, new, unexpected discoveries, assorted "odd" research like SETI, and so on, but I'd like to know what is the "daily bread" of every astronomer nowadays?
What are the current typical, routine tasks of an average professional astronomer? What is being observed/measured/searched for? What challenges occupy most effort and time? Or am I wrong assuming there even is such a thing, and every observatory is a unique snowflake?
