Why does the distance between Sun and Earth stay the same?

We all know Sun gravity, makes the space time curvature and space pushes the earth towards the Sun. But my question is "why the distance between the Sun and Earth is Same? Earth should have moved closer to Sun and obviously Earth should fall into the Sun."
Thanks.
