Will Starlink deface the night sky?

There is some discussion (and there are some questions on this site) about the impact of Starlink on observational astronomy. I am not an astronomer, but I am amazed by the beauty an immensity of the night sky.
Must I be concerned, from an aesthetical point of view, that Starlink will change the night sky that I and countless people before me have admired? For example, will there be less stars visible to the naked eye, or will the night sky be defaced by a myriad of artificial light sources?
For background: Starlink is a commercial project by SpaceX, a private company, that seeks to launch thousands of small satellites into the earth's orbit.
