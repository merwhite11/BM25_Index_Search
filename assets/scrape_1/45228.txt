People Working on Dark Matter Simulations

I am interested in simulations regarding dark matter. I am looking for more details and reading material on the same. I was really hoping to get some guidance from someone working in that field. Can you guys please drop the names of some people that I could get in touch with for guidance? Thanks!
Edit: I've read Profumo and Tanedo's lecture/notes on Dark Matter. Currently my professor has asked me to read Bauer's Yet Another Introduction to Dark Matter. I haven't read anything about dark matter simulations as of yet.
