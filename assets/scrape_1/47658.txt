Why did this observation hint at a transition to the heliocentric model?

My professor said that there was an observation made in ancient times, that if the Earth completes a rotation in 24 hours, it must be spinning incredibly fast. However, people at the mid-latitudes hardly felt this motion. This was a stepping stone in the transition from the geocentric to heliocentric model.
I actually do not understand how the fact stated above hints at a heliocentric model. I find the two facts unrelated. Can you explain how?
