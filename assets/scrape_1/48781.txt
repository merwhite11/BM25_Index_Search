Can planetary rings distort the shape of a planet?

I was watching this Kurzgesagt video on what would happen if the moon crashed into the Earth, and it mentioned that at the very end the tidal forces would tear the moon apart and create planetary rings around Earth. What piqued my curiosity was that Earth would experience extreme tidal forces from the moon until it broke apart into rings.
This makes sense to me as when the moon is whole, all the mass is in relatively one place so the force of gravity will be stronger at its center of gravity, and when it's turned into rings there is no center of gravity for the moon anymore as its constituent particles are now spread around the Earth. But they must still exert some gravity on Earth, and I was wondering if it's possible for planetary rings to distort the shape of the planet if they are massive enough. I.e. say the rings were directly over the equator, the part of the Earth at the equator would be closer to the rings and therefore experience a greater force. Could this force distort the Earth to make it more oval shaped at the equator?
