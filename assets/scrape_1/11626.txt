How is a non-rotating black hole created


How are non-rotating black holes formed?

I guess that non-rotating black holes are formed from non-rotating stars but I couldn't find any proof that such a star exists on the internet. If this is true can you also put up an example of such a star?

Does the matter absorption of a non-rotating black hole differ from a rotating black hole?
