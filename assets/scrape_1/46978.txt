When calculating the mass of stars, is it considered that additional mass could be added because of pair-production?

I would like to know that, since stars emit a lot of photons where some of them could be producing electrons-positrons pairs, if its mass affects the calculations, and if because of this is different from calculating the mass of a planet (which don't produce high energy photons)...
Are shinning objects more massive than its own particles' masses?
