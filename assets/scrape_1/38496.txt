How likely does a body more massive than Eris exist beyond the Kuiper belt?

Other than the hypothetical Planet IX, is it likely if there's a (dwarf) planet more massive than Eris orbiting between Eris and Planet IX? Michael Brown seems to have found it likely. As far as we know about the many Kuiper-belt-and-beyond objects now, can we exclude a more massive body beyond Eris or is it possible that there's such massive body at, let's say, 150 au from the Sun?
