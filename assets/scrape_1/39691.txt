What caused these strange craters on Hyperion?

I was looking at pictures of the moons of Saturn and noticed that the craters on Hyperion have a strange shape, somewhat resembling sinkholes. They look a lot deeper than the impact craters on other moons (including ours). Is it an optical illusion (perhaps caused by the presence of dark material at the bottom of the craters?) that somehow makes them look deeper? If not, what process caused these holes to appear?
