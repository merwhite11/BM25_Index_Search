Does the presence of dark matter in the Milky Way significantly distort our parallax based measurements of distance?

According to accepted astronomical wisdom, dark matter represents a large fraction of the total mass of the Milky Way.  And thanks to Papa Einstein, we know that light rays can be bent when passing through spacetime distorted by a mass distribution. Thus, does the presence of dark matter in and around our galaxy significantly distort measurements of parallax and the distances calculated therefrom?
