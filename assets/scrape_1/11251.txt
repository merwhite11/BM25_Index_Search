Will the Sun rotate slower in red giant form?

When the Sun runs out of hydrogen to fuse it will grow bigger in size and my question is does it rotate more slowly, like a spinning ice skater extending their arms to reduce angular velocity? What consequences will accompany with a slower dynamo (big ball of plasmas), such as more frequent solar flares or perhaps more dark spots?
