Moon’s orbit shift

Has our moon’s orbit shifted since its formation? Has there been eclipses on the Earth since last ~4 billion years? In other words, was there a time when Moon's orbit was at an inclination to Earth's orbit around the Sun that there were no eclipses? How would you find out such a phenomenon? Are there any paleontological or geological or astronomical data points which can provide insight here?

In the illustration, moon's orbit has 5 degree tilt w.r.t ecliptic plane in left direction. Is it possible that moon's orbit was tilted at x degrees w.r.t ecliptic plane but in the direction of the Sun? In such a case, there won't be any eclipses!
ps: thanks keith for the illustration
