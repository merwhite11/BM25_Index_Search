Jupiter's effect on a hypothetical "warm" Europa's water

Imagine for a moment that Europa is not frozen solid (at least on the surface).
Would the fact that it is tidally locked to Jupiter mean that the water would be stagnate?   So there would be no tides such as are caused by the rotation of the moon on earth's ocean?
I am sure Ganymede and Io would cause tides, but the question we are trying to answer is if a water planet tidally locked to another planet would have tides.
