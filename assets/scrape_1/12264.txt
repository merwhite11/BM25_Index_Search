How do we know that light is redshifted/blueshifted and not the original light of a star/galaxy?

If a star/galaxy is moving towards us, then its light is blueshifted, and if it is moving away from us, then its light is redshifted. How do we exactly know that the color we are seeing is not part of the fuel burnt by the star/galaxy, and is instead caused by the Doppler effect?
