Meteorites bring water

The latest information suggests that Earth's water came from Meteorites . The Moon was also bombarded by Meteorites and yet it has no water. Is this because it lacks an atmosphere and its water was lost in space ?
On further thought on this matter, it occurred to me that Mars has an atmosphere and yet it has no oceans either, just like the Moon . So Mars I assume was bombarded by meteorites, just like the Earth was and it has a stronger gravity than the Moon, yet it doesn't have oceans either ? So what happened ?
