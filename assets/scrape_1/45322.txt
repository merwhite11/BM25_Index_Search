Surface composition of Mercury?

I've been doing research on the surface composition of Mercury, but it doesn't seem that there are many helpful results online from ArXiv. One article from PNAS describes the composition of Mercury as a whole, but does not mention its surface features. Are there any resources that detail the surface composition of Mercury, noting most (if not every) compound/element?
