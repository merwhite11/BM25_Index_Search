ds9 configuration issue

I'm trying to use DS9 for X-ray image analysis. Before that I have to configure it for use, I need to click on option using web proxy.

Beside use internal web browser checkbox there should be another checkbox with name using web proxy that I have to check in to use this software specifically.
I using windows 11.
I tried to configure my system for proxy control pannel>Network and Internet>Internet Options>Connections>Lan settings then checked in at use a proxy server for your LAN.
