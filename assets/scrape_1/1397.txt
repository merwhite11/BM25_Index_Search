Where is all the antimatter?

The universe supposedly started off with equal parts matter and antimatter and they are said to annihilate each other. Also, nature is famous for it's balance between everything. So all we see is matter and no antimatter (I guess that's a good thing, we would all have been annihilated otherwise), so where did all the antimatter go?
Also, does antimatter exist in the same space as matter? What are the leading theories about it?
