Can a laser pointer ruin a long exposure photo?

I am a hobby astronomer and usually out with people that aren't familiar with the night sky. 
In order to help them find constellations or show them stuff in the sky, I was thinking of buying a laser pointer.  Now because I do not want to ruin any photos of people that might be around my observation place, do some of the more experienced folks of you know about the effects of these laserpointers to photos?
