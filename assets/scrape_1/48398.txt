Do Stars other than Sun, have its own solar system ? How different are those from our Solar system?

This will sound like a idiotic question so apologies if I make you want to roll your eyes but... so we look into our night sky and we see the stars, does each of the stars we see have their own version of our solar system? Are they circulated by planets of some kind? So the pin prick of light we can see in our sky is the equivalent of our sun for instance? I've tried googling this but I'm still confused! Thank for to whoever is patient enough to answer :)
