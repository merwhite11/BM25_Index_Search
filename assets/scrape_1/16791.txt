Accretion discs emitting jets

When there are accretion discs jets of particles or radiations will be emitted in the direction parallel to the rotational axis.
My beginner level astronomy textbook just says that it is due to magnetic field but does not explain why.
So can anyone explain the mechanism in layman's terms? Thanks in advance!
