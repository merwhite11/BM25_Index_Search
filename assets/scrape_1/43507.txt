Is it true that black holes emit only photons, electrons, and positrons in the form of Hawking Radiation?

According to this comment, if the peak photon energy is 511 KeV, electrons and antielectrons begin to be produced along with photons. So when the peak energy is ~940 MeV, the rest mass of a proton, will they be produced as well, and what types of subatomic particles can be generated via Hawking Radiation?
