Term for the period between planet alignments?

Is there an established astronomical term for the period of time between alignments of pairs of planets?  For example, Mars, Earth, and the Sun roughly align ever 780 Earth days.  In my writing, I've variously call this period the 'alignment cycle' or 'conjunction cycle' or 'opposition cycle', but I'd like to know if there's a correct term for this.
