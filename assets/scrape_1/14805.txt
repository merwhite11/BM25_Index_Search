How far does the moon move relative to the sun during a solar eclipse

Let's assume 'solar eclipse' occurred
Now, at what degree 'moon' will be in 'with reference to' earth (and)   at what degree 'moon' will be in 'with reference to' sun
In other words, by 'how many degrees' (out of 360 deg) the moon would have orbited 'earth' and 'sun' in the event of 'solar eclipse'?
