Was Theia not a Kuiper Belt Object?

Was Theia not a Kuiper Belt Object?
I assume most water is lost during formation of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone, and is subsequently replenished with comets or (if you're lucky) KBO/ice moons. Is this accurate?
So Theia was a KBO, right? https://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/did-theia-bring-water-to-the-earth.php  Is this a mainstream notion already?
Edit - not sure I understand any grounds for snark, if the origin of Earth's abundant water is still an open question.
