What would be the effect of a large solar flare on motor vehicles?

With the solar cycle now leading to an increase in flare activity, one naturally starts to think the effects of a large solar flare heading this way.
While major flares like the Carrington Event are well described, along with the impact in NE Canada in 1989, what I have had some trouble finding is the effect of a large solar flare on modern motor vehicles. Would a large solar flare cause the batteries in a Tesla to explode? Would it destroy the electronic ignition in a Honda Accord? Would we even be able to turn on and drive a modern car (use a 2015 Honda Accord as a reference)?
I looked through some recent posts - here and here, but didn't find a good answer.
