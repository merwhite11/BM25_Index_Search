How is V1057 Cygni supposed to go from K type dwarf to F type giant?

FU Orionis variables are protostars that go through massive outbursts that drastically change the star's spectral type and magnitude. With the star V1057 Cygni, this star was known to go from a K type dwarf star (K V) to an F-type supergiant, according to Wikipedia. In 2016, a study showed that this star had a companion. So does this change any property (age, reason for eruption) of this star, and why did this FUor have such a massive change in luminosity?
