do meteroid impacts occur evenly across the entire moon surface?

Since the moon is tidally locked and has the same face showing to the earth, I would expect that the earth's shadow represents an area on the moon that would be spared some meteoroid impacts. Does the side of the moon opposite the earth have more craters than the side facing us?
