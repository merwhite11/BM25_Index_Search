How can I find the depth of a portion of the Valles Marineris?

How can I find the depth of the low lying part of this image of the western part of Valles Marineris?
I'm interested in the area northeast of Noctis Labyrinthus, southwest of Tithonium Chasma, north of Oudemans, and west of Ius Chasma.
I couldn't find any contour maps of Valles Marineris or Noctis Labyrinthus
