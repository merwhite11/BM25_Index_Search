Calculate Earth Zenith Point of Another Planet with Azimuth and Elevation of another Observer Point

I need to find the Longitude of the closest point on Earth (zenith) to Jupiter with the Azimuth and Elevation data from another observation location at a given point in time.
Below is the source of my data points for one specific second in time:
Target:  Jupiter

Observer Point: Detroit, Mi
Center geodetic : 275.606400,33.7528000,1.581E-12 
{E-lon(deg),Lat(deg),Alt(km)}

Point in Time
2014-Sep-14 00:00

Target
Right Ascension:  09 00 45.15
Declination:      +17 29 55.9

Azimuth:      311.279081
Elevation:        -22.059168

Below is the calculation I use to get the zenith latitude.  I'm not 100% sure it's correct, but logically it seems correct.
Calulate Target Zenith Latitude
90° - Elevation = Target Zenith Latitude
90° - (-22°) = 78°
- The Zenith latitude of Jupiter at 
  this point in time is 78° 

Though I'm not sure how to find the correct zenith longitude.  Since the elevation is negative, -22.059168, I assume Jupiter is not visible from Detroit as it is below the horizon at that time.
Logically it seems that one would first need to find the NWN horizon longitude at the Azimuth of 311.  And then add  22° to that latitude to find the zenith longitude of Jupiter to Earth given the data from the Detroit observer point..
I don't know if this logic is correct.  And if it is, I don't know how to calculate that absolute horizon longitude at the 311 azimuth at a particular moment in time.
I'm hoping someone can help me calculate the correct longitude of the Earth's Zenith point to Jupiter.
