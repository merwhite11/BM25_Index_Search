The colour of saturn as it appears to the naked eye

I have started to watch the skies in order to learn stars, constellations planets etc. The few references I checked state that Saturn presents itself to the naked eye as a pale yellow tiny little ball, easy to notice if one knows beforehand its position. 
So, using Stellarium I have managed to learn that Saturn is near the Scorpio constellation, just below its claws, which is easy to spot because Antares has distinct red-orange colour. 
However, when I first spotted the planet I noticed that it was like a blue ball. I should say it looked like a pale, near white blue or a pale blue, near white -- I can not be more precise than this. 
I am spotting it correctly? I was taught that planets do not scintillate like stars. The ball I am talking about certainly did not do it. If I did spot it correctly, I would like to ask if and how often Saturn changes its colours. 
p.s. I thought it might be a case of city pollution, however I should say I live in a small mountain village with very few if any air or light pollution.
Many thanks in advance.
