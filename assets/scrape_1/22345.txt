Dark enough to see stars during total solar eclipse?

I was fortunate enough to see totality during the eclipse of 2017 August 21. 
It did leave me wondering about the 1919 Eddington experiment, though.  During totality, it only got dark enough to see a few of the brightest objects like Venus and Jupiter.  It was more like twilight than night that way.  
So how were they able to see and photograph stars in the 1919 eclipse?  Do skies get darker during some total eclipses than others?  Was there more light scattering in my case, from being in a populated area?  Or do the right optics let you photograph stars during twilight-like conditions?
