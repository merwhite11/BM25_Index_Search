Back-predicting solar eclipses

I want to back-predict solar eclipses as part of a research project.
My main goal is to obtain a list of all solar eclipses that took place over a tight grid (let's say of 100km by 100km) for the years 5000BC to 4000BC (just as an example).
Ideally, I'd like results to follow, more or less, the format here of https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/JSEX/JSEX-SA.html, but any library you can suggest will be fine.
According to the previous reference, "The Besselian elements and values of ΔT used in Solar Eclipse Explorer are the same as those used by Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000. For the purposes of calculating eclipse circumstances from a given place, the growing uncertainty in the value of ΔT and the corresponding longitude become unacceptably large outside time period of -1499 to 3000 (1500 BCE to 3000 CE)." and hence I could not use their tool.
Since I will simply count how many eclipses could be seen at the center of each square on my grid for the 1000-year period, I can tolerate large inaccuracies in the timing of eclipses. Moreover, as long as errors are random, I can also afford missing some eclipses or having them missplaced.
Is there any resource I could use to compute eclipses as I described?
