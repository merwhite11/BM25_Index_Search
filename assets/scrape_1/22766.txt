Why doesn't the Sun explode?

I know stars explode because of the fuel causing a fusion compound pushing it apart and the fuel runs out and it 'bounces' for lack of a better term.
Given the fact that more massive stars are supposed to explode more quickly: why doesn't the Sun explode considering its massive size?
