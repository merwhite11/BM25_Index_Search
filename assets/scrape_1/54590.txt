Why are radio telescopes often built into natural depressions?

Radio telescopes are often built into sink holes or natural depressions in the landscape.* This is opposed to optical telescopes which are usually placed on mountains to avoid as much atmosphere as they can.
So why natural depressions? Is it easier to build them in a hole, less interference from local emissions, or something else?
