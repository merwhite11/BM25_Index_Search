What was the absolute limit to the possible sizes of the first stars formed from "primordial material with no metals"?

This answer to Why don't or (can't) stars be more than 325 or so times the mass of the sun? What limits their size? includes the following:

...The upper limit you refer to is for compositions similar to the Sun. For stars born in the distant past that were metal-poor, or even born from primordial material with no metals, the upper limit could be much higher.

Question: What was the absolute limit to the possible sizes of the first stars formed from "primordial material with no metals"? I'm primarily asking about the size that was possible to exist as a star. There may be other limits associated with the possibility of formation in the first place due to matter distribution and that would be interesting to know as well.
NOTE: There is also the well-received and as yet unanswered question Formation of the First Stars If this topic is better addressed as an answer there instead, then please do so and we can close this as a duplicate.
