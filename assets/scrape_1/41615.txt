Why is Space 3D?

Why is Space a THREE DIMENSIONAL ENTITY?
I know that In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it
I'm a student and I have tried to find the answer to this question but I probably didn't get any answer that I understand...
So pls help me with this as I'm still a beginner here!
Thanks!
