Could gravity be the 4th dimension?

According to Michio Kaku, in his book Hyperspace, he said that in this Hyperspace, there exist a total of 10 dimensions that govern the laws of physics. Is it possible that we too live in a Hyperspace, and if so, would gravity be the 4th dimension that would govern the laws of physics we are yet to discover?
