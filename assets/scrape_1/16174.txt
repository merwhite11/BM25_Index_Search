Could asteroid mining affect gravitational balance?

I'm just a guy who is interested in all topics around space, so forgive me if it is a dumb question.
I have read some things about asteroid mining in the past and I think it's a really interesting topic, as it opens up a lot of possibilities.
But one thing came to my mind. Humans tend to pushing things a little too far sometimes when we want to reach a goal. So, imagine, we are getting really good at off-earth mining at a larger scale and in a larger timespan, we continue to mine thousands and thousands of asteroids. Wouldn't that affect the gravitational balance of our star system at some point, or is the gravitational influence of an asteroid belt negligible? I am talking about extreme examples, like removing nearly the whole asteroid belt beyond Mars. Also, what would happen to all the stuff we don't need from an asteroid?
I'm sure I'm not the first one who thinks of something like this, but I found nothing about this particular topic.
