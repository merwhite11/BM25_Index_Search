Moving object seen through telescope, what is it?

I was using my telescope to look at a nebula, intell I seen a star like object that was moving at a moderate speed in a straight line and eventually dimmed out. My first thought that it was just a satellite but I could only see it through my telescope which makes me think that it was to small to be a satellite. I'm not sure.
