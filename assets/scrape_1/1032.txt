What is the maximum transmission distance of the radio signal in the outer space which could still be understood?

Iâ€™ll put this question in a form of a physics problem:
Transmitter at a point A sends a signal to a receiver at a point B. What is the longest distance in light years from points A to B for which receiver can still understand the signal?
Given:

Signal type: electromagnetic wave.
Signal frequency: frequency for which signal fades the least - probably radio.
Signal form:

Variant 1: beam of highest concentration possible.
Variant 2: full sphere.

Transmitter power: power of the most powerful transmitter known to be built in the Earth.
Receiver: sensitivity of the most sensitive receiver known to be built in the Earth.
Transmission medium: interstellar space.
Understanding of a signal:

Variant A: Can detect that the signal is not a noise.
Variant B: Can decode the information in the signal.
