Why are type 1b and type 1c supernovae called type 1 rather than type 2; if they result from large exploding stars, rather than accreting dwarfs?

What similarities do types Ib and Ic supernovae have in common with type 1a?
Are their spectra or their magnitudes more similar to accreting white dwarfs than the other supermassive, main sequence, exploding-at-the-ends-of-their-lives stars?
Are types 1a and 1b 'smaller' than type 2?
I am confused.....
