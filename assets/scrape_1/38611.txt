Origins of meteorites?

I am aware that the vast majority of meteorites come from the asteroid belt (including 4 Vesta), with some from the Moon and Mars. Are there any other locations from which meteorites have originated (the Kuiper belt? Ceres?). Here it mentions that carbonaceous chondrites formed farthest from the Sun. Is that still within the asteroid belt?
