When two galaxies with dark matter halos merge do they provide evidence for fermionic or bosonic dark matter?

If dark matter is made from fermions these should collide and cause dark matter to become denser in some places than others Bosons wont collide in this way so there should a different effect .So is there any observational evidence to suggest density changes of one kind or another?
