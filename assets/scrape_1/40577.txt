Rotational inertia, angular momentum of the Solar system

Is there Rotational inertia of the Solar system as one entity "disk"? Is this even possible?

The angular momentum of a multi-point system in the Solar system - Since the different planets have different mass and orbital periods then does create angular momentum, inertia in the system?

How can one planet affect another planet in the system from its individual rotation?

Does the solar system exhibit rigid body rotation from the mass distributed over planets?
