How do stars change in size over their main sequence lifetime?

I know that main sequence stars increase in temperature and luminosity as they age. However, I do not know about how they change in size. Do they expand? If so, why do they expand? Do they grow very much? Iâ€™ve tried to search up the answer, but details were limited, so I would appreciate an answer here.
