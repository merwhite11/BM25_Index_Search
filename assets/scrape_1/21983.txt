I saw something unusual in the sky

So I'm a beginner at astronomy and I was trying to look at the moon but while trying to aim at it I saw a ring-like object in the sky. Does anyone know what this would be? all I could see was a ring with nothing in the middle of it. Was this a special type of star?
