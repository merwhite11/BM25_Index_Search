Do stars in galaxies also move in elliptical orbits?

There is a gravitational force between every pair of objects, because of which planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits.
My question is: as planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at a focus, do the stars in galaxies orbit as well? And if they do, then what are the foci of their orbits? Since the gravity force of black holes is very strong, are black holes at any of the focus of a star's orbit?
