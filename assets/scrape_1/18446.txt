Calculating the date and year when a lunar eclipse will fall on the Winter Solstice

I am a novelist working on a new book, titled Werewolves In The Christmas City, which happens to be Bethlehem, Pa. In 2010 when I was working on a book titled The Christmas City Vampire, a lunar eclipse on the Winter Solstice occurred. As you know it was the first one since 1638. On the 2010 occurrence, I added the resurrection of two werewolves-twins-turned during that eclipse of 1638. My question is: How would my professor character figure out that the event will occur in 2010. The time frame I am in right now is 1947. I would appreciate any help you can give me. Math is certainly not one of my strong suites.
