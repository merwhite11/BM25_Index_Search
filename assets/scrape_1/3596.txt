Term for a momentary geometric pattern formed by astronomical objects

Few days back, the Pleiades, the Sun and the Moon were forming an almost perfect equilateral triangle.
Is there a term that describes such momentary geometrical patterns? Asterism and conjunction are close, but not exactly applicable here.
