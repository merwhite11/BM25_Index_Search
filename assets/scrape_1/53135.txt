How did asteroid (7482) 1994 PC1 get its "face"? Is it reconstructed from optical or radar imaging, or something else?

NPR's March 10, 2023 Newly found asteroid has a 'very small chance' of hitting Earth, NASA says includes an image of what looks like a computer reconstructed 3D surface of an asteroid, perhaps from delay-doppler radar imaging or optical images (photographs) taken at many solar phase angles.
Similar but smaller rendering at a different angle can be seen in ABC News' January 19, 2023 Huge asteroid safely passes close to Earth
Due to the miracle of Pareidolia I'm seeing two big eyes with pupils (could also be seen as a big pair of round glasses), a triangular nose, and a big round circular mouth reminiscent of Mr. Bill's "Oh no!"
Question: How did asteroid (7482) 1994 PC1 get its "face"? How was the surface topography (assuming this is really from data) reconstructed and rendered? What data was used, and primarily from what instrument(s)?


Asteroid 2023 DW will make a close approach to Earth on Feb. 14, 2046. NASA and other agencies are closely monitoring the asteroid to learn more about its projected path.
