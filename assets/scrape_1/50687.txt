Does gravity extend out infinitely?

The sunâ€™s gravity gets weaker the further out you go, the same goes with the Earth. But even back out all the way to Neptune and Pluto, the gravity is still there. The sun can even keep Sedna which at its aphelion of close to 1000 AU, still keeps Sedna from flying away. Does this technically mean that the gravity from celestial bodies extend out infinitely, even if it has a really tiny effect further out?
