Magnification using a CMOS sensor

I'm reworking my question regarding magnification of my 60mm, ⨍=700mm refractor. The video eyepiece is a CMOS sensor with a pixel size of 5.6μ x 5.6μ. The number of pixels is 720 X 480 with a 0.3 megapixel resolution. That said, I'm clueless regarding an algorithm from which you could decipher the magnification given these physical characteristics of the CMOS sensor. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you!
