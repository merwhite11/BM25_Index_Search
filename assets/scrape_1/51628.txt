How were sundials and moondials possible 800 years ago?

In India, there is a temple named Konark Sun Temple which is around 750 years old and made up of 100% stones and rocks, and has a chariot which is headed by 7 horses and includes the Hindu god Surya(Sun) in the chariot.
This chariot has 24 wheels out of which, only 2 were understood by humans, the rest 22 are still a mystery.
Those 2 wheels work like a perfect sundial.

Question: How were ancient Indians able to perform such mind-boggling calculations without any kind of technology? Is there any other way to make such a huge sundial without modern technology?
