Why is nuclear pasta the strongest part of a neutron star?

From my very rudimentary understanding of neutron stars taken from the abstract to "Elasticity of Nuclear Pasta", nuclear pasta is the strongest substance, hence the strongest part of a neutron star.

Our results show that nuclear pasta may be the strongest known material, perhaps with a shear modulus of $10^{30}$ ergs/cm³ and a breaking strain greater than 0.1.

It seems like unbelievable pressure can only increase the closer to the core of the star. With all of the particles condensed, wouldn't that– the core– be the strongest part? Not the pasta?
