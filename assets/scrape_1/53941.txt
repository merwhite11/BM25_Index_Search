Is the Sun hotter today, in terms of absolute temperature (i.e., NOT total luminosity), than it was in the distant past?

I am constantly reading that the Sun is at least 20% 'hotter', in terms of total radiation/luminosity, than it was a few million years after its formation (i.e., after the Hayashi stage...)
But what about its absolute temperature?  I know that it hasn't changed as much, but has it increased (or decreased) at all?
