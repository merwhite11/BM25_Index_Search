Dark Energy Expansion

The new Cosmos extra features mentions that at about 6,771,500,000 years ago the universe began an accelerated expansion. How do we know this? What evidence do we have for this renewed and accelerated expansion?
From the interactive cosmic calendar on the new Cosmos bluray, dates above taken from the heading

Until [now], gravity has been slowing the expansion of the universe,
  but suddenly a mysterious, unknown force that we call dark energy
  takes over, the expansion of the universe begins to accelerate

How do we know it was dark energy? Given we can't define or detect dark energy, why do we believe this is the cause? How do we even know this new acceleration happened? Something in the red shift? Is there a gap in the red shift in things we can see that would imply a slow expansion and then a fast expansion? If there is a gap, why is dark energy the only explanation? Or are there other theories?

Yes that is a lot of questions, but the main question is how do we know an accelerated expansion happened at that time? the rest of the questions stem from that, mainly in asking for data to back up claims, for or against
