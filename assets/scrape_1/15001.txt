Difference in energy released in stellar mass black hole merger and supermassive black hole merger

Super massive black holes are usually millions of times more massive than stellar mass black holes. I have read on SE and over internet that 3Mâ˜‰ worth of energy is released in black hole mergers (not sure which type of merger). I have tow related questions:

What is the difference in energy released from a stellar mass black hole merger vs. a supermassive black hole merger?  
How much energy will be released in the super massive black hole merger when Milky way and Andromeda will merge in few billion years?
