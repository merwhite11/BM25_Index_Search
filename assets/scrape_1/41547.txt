Accelerations on the Moon due to its orbit and its spin

A gyroscope is placed on the equator of the Moon. It detects among others 2 accelerations: one due to the orbit and one due to the spin. What is the module of the second one compared to the first one?
(the effects due to the tilting of the orbit, the librations, the Sun... are neglected.)
