Which one is better for both the beginner dad and the 7-yr old? Sky-Watcher 130P or Celestron StarSense Explorer 114AZ

I am looking for a beginner scope for myself and my 7-yr old. She has been asking for a telescope for some time but I don't know how immersed she would be, once bought. So, I want something which can build her interest right from the beginning and she does not lose it. I am looking for something that can be used to view the planets, some galaxies, and nebulae.
I have surfed through multiple questions on this topic and through the answers I looked at, I zeroed in on Sky-Watcher Heritage 130.
I also came across Celestron Starsense 114AZ Explorer. This seems to be an easy-to-use option but I don't know how is the quality or how good is it for long-term use. Or if it can be used as a manual if the smartphone dock stuff fails in the future.
I know this is a very commonly asked question and I am sorry for kind of repeating it but being a beginner I don't really know the difference between the two. Also, there are no astronomy clubs or societies in my vicinity where I can take my kid so that we get to dip our feet before proceeding with a purchase.
Please share if you have any other suggestions.
