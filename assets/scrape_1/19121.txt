Light From Sirius

I would like to know how large a telescope's  mirror aperture would need to be, that is pointed squarely at Sirius to equal the light intensity at the focus of a 5 inch glass lens of our Sun? I well know that such a telescope is impossible. I am trying to grasp better the true dimness of starlight from a somewhat unorthodox perspective. Thank you.
