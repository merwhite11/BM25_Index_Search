More than 67 Jovian moons?

Wikipedia says that there are now 67 known moons of Jupiter. 
It got me wondering: is it really possible in our day and age that there are more, but we haven't observed them yet? 
On the other hand, there is a Jovian moon discovered as recently as in 2011, so I wouldn't be amazed if the answer was 'yes'.
Really though, choosing Jupiter for this question was a bit arbitrary on my part, as the same question can be asked for other more distant and bigger planets of our solar system, like Saturn.
