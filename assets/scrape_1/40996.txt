From what distance could the Sun's planetary nebula be seen entirely with free eye?

When collapsing to a white dwarf, a red giant Sun would emit a planetary nebula. How far from the Sun would that nebula stretch at most?
Also: At about what distance could you see the planetary nebula completely in all its beauty, I mean so that the entire nebula would match into your eye's field of view? The Earth and Mars would be deep within the nebula I guess, as well as the main asteroid belt. If you watched the Sun from Eris' aphelion or Sedna's perihelion, I guess that would be best to observe the entire nebula or ain't I correct? And what would the nebula look like from Proxima Centauri b?
In other words, how close to the Sun's planetary nebula can you be and still see it entirely in its beauty?
