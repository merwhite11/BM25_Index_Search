Nomenclature of Interstellar Objects and Stars

I posted this question on the space exploration SE but people recommended that it would be more on-topic here. Could someone please help by giving some definite laws of nomenclature for celestial objects, like the provisional names given before a proper name is decided... I am copy-pasting the question here:
I tried searching the answer to this on Google for hours and visited the IAU website as well, but it didn't really clarify my doubt. I was reading about Black Widow Pulsar, which is an "eclipsing binary millisecond pulsar in the Milky Way" and after its common name, in brackets is given PSR B1957+20. How is this named? What nomenclature rules are used? Was this the provisional name given before it was named Black Widow Pulsar or is this the scientific name of the neutron star?
This is the case with most interstellar objects and stars. Like Ultima Thule has another name 486958 Arrokoth? Is this a scientific name? Please explain what nomenclature conventions are used to name the asteroids and stars.
