If you are in a deep gravity well, where time goes by more slowly, do you see the unfolding of a cosmic event at a different rate?

If you were on one of those planets orbiting a super massive black hole (ala Interstellar), where time is moving more slowly, would you time astronomical events differently or even the age of the universe?
