What are opinions of most planetary scientists on this study (link below), were there already some complex reviews in scientific journals?

I remember this two year old article from Universe Today about this study, "Stepwise Earth oxygenation is an inherent property of global biogeochemical cycling", by Lewis J. Alcott, Benjamin J. W. Mills, Simon W. Poulton of the School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, in the UK.
In summary, widely accepted the three-step model of Earth’s oxygenation outlines three major shifts in Earth’s history, with each one substantially altering the Earth’s atmosphere by adding more oxygen. The history of Earth’s oxygenation is complicated, it wasn’t a linear progression and a certain level of luck is required to create an oxygen-rich world. Based on this, exoplanets with oxygen rich breathable atmosphere should be extremely rare.
The authors of this study created different model where stepwise Earth oxygenation is an inherent property of global biogeochemical cycling and based on this model, once the Earth had the right microbes and plate tectonics, which were both established 3 billion years ago, it was only a matter of time before it reached the oxygen level it has now, regardless of volcanic activity and land-based plants. That means that exoplanets with oxygen rich breathable atmospheres could be much more common than was previously thought.
What are the opinions of the majority of planetary scientists on this study ? Do most of them still believe in three-step model of Earth’s oxygenation or this new model where Earth’s oxygenation was inherent process and matter of time since evolution of early photosynthetic organisms ? Was this study already peered reviewed in scientific journals ? Despite that it is almost 2 years old and on very important topic, I could not find any reviews in scientific journals that I read.
