How is it possible that a Big Bang happened instead of becoming trapped as a Kugelblitz?

I was reading about Kugelblitz on Wikipedia, and it says that if enough energy gets concentrated it leads to a black hole (from where nothing can escape - supposedly). So, if during the Big-Bang, when all the energy of the universe was in a really small region of space, why didn't it lead to a black hole and stay forever like that?
