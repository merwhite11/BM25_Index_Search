Is it theoretically possible to see a spiral galaxy head on, and side on, if there is a convenient gravitational lensing effect?

I was thinking this when I heard Professor Mike Merrifield say something to the effect of "unfortunately we've never seen the same galaxy side on and head on, so we can compare notes on our theories about spiral galaxies", in a DeepSkyVideos' video (I forget which).
Perhaps with the right gravity well in the right place, it might be possible?
Do we have any examples of this? Is anyone looking?
