How long do the phases of sunset take?

How long does it take from the moment the Sun star 'touches' the horizon, to the time it totally disappear? (I'm not talking about the radiation (rays), but just about the appearance of the star by itself. I don't care of the rays). If I were near a beach or plane I'd check it, but I'm in crowded urban region so it's difficult to check it I believe).
