Does earth's Umbra reach Sun-Earth L2?

Moon can be fully eclipsed by the virtue of being fairly close to Earth. Any body distant enough will not be eclipsed fully, Earth's disc not fully covering Sun's disc. How's that for anything at the L2 point? Will it be lit by Sun's corona or will it bask in deep shadow of Earth?
Bonus question: if Umbra does reach there, how large a body could remain fully shaded at L2? What's the Umbra's radius there?
