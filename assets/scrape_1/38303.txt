Is cosmology an accurate field?

I'm new here this is my first question. I'm an engineering student and I really like mathematics, I've recently watched a movie about Stephen Hawking (The Theory of Everything) In which he makes various discoveries about black holes. This made me curious about cosmology and the only thing I know about this subject is

Cosmology is a branch of astronomy concerned with the studies of the origin and evolution of the universe, from the Big Bang to today and on into the future

This made me question how accurate it is, since there is no way to see
