How can Aggregation of Gravitational Fields of subplanetary solar objects improve our understanding of the motion of the planets?

If we imagine magnets on a table as a simplified analogy in regards to gravitational attraction between objects, then it may be demonstrated that when three objects are placed in a row labeled in order A,B,& C in such a manor that if object A is moved, objects B,& C will respond by moving. If then object B is removed moving object A will not affect object C. If this analogy is considered for all objects in the solar system, or the whole galaxy, can we not extrapolate an explanation of how imagining the removal of a planet from the Solar System may affect every object in the galaxy? Could the destabilization of the asteroids destabilize the planets?
