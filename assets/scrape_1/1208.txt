What can be seen with a 4.5" telescope

I just got a 4.5" Newtonian reflector.  The skies haven't been clear where I live lately so I've only been able to use it to see the moon and Jupiter (I was also able to see the Galilean moons).  A friend of mine with a similar telescope says he can see Saturn with its rings and the phases of Venus with his telescope.  I am wondering what else I can see with a telescope my size, specifically which Messier objects I can see with my telescope.  I live in a suburban area near a small urban area and so light pollution is a concern but I have access to darker skies close by.
