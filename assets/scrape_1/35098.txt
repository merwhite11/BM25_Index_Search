Gas Planets composition and gravitational effects

It has been postulated that Gas Giants have a solid core and an obvious gaseous atmosphere.  Question:  As the gas is a state of matter and gravity draws all matter inward, is the reason the gas is not drawn towards the core and condensed into a solid because the extent of the effect that the gravity has on the gas proportional to the mass of that gas.  Additionally, wouldn't this create a series of unique gaseous layers and wouldn't the depth of those unique layers be contingent on the layers composition.  Also, could the gravitational effect on the known layers be used to determine the composition of the core.
