Is the Dwarf Planet class really necessary?

Another way of asking this is, what is the difference between dwarf planets and asteroids? Aren't they the same things? It's just that some asteroids are spherical and others aren't...or is there something else?
I can understand why Pluto was demoted. Same thing happened to Ceres (after 50 years of being called a planet?) when we found out it was in an asteroid belt. It would be more helpful to laymen, I think, if the Kuiper Belt was renamed to the Second Asteroid Belt or maybe the Icy Asteroid Belt.
But why not stick to the original classes where we only had planet and asteroid? (and moon i guess.) Why add a new class called dwarf planets? Was it just to temper the protests?
EDIT: I forgot to add, we never needed a dwarf planet class before, despite knowing that Ceres was spherical for a long time. So where has this need, if it really exists, come from?
