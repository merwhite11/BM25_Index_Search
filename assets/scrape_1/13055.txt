How do we know that the Universe is still expanding now?

Yes, I know that most galaxies have a red shift and that means they are moving away from us. 
The problem is that the farthest galaxies are 13.8 billion light years away. That means that the info is 13.8 billion years old.
What has been puzzling me for years is that the red shift observation shows that the galaxies were receding 13.8 billion years ago. We don't have direct data on what they are doing now. It is natural that the universe was expanding with a tremendous speed at that time because it was near to the big bang, but how do we know that it still is?
If the furthest galaxies are moving with higher speed than the nearer, that means to me that their speed is reducing with the time.
