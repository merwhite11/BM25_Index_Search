Trying to understand this graph (stellar activity)


I managed to trace this graph back to http://katjapoppenhaeger.com/?p=457. It's meant to show how stellar activity declines with time for different star types, and whilst I get the general idea, I don't really understand what either axis means. Y is presumably some measurement of activity, and X is probably age, but the logarithmic part is really unclear.
Is the X axis using E+ (1e+1 = 10) numbers?
I'm really into realistic worldbuilding, but I was never really good at maths...
