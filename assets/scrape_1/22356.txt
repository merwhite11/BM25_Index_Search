Why is it not always light?

Hopefully this is not a silly question, but I was wondering why earth is not always in the light (and any other planet for that matter). I mean, we have billions of stars just in our galaxy that all give off light from all directions. That light has obviously reached is as we can see them shimmering in the night sky. 
With that in mind, what has happened to the light from the stars? Has it weakened somehow? (didn't think that was possible) Surely if we are being hit with light from all directions, it makes sense that we should always be illuminated. So what's going on here?
