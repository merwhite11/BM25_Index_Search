When was the longest day on record?

The Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down. It was significantly shorter in the prehistoric past, but now we need to add a leap second every few years and we've not yet had to take any back. In fifty thousand years, it is thought we'd need a leap second every day.
The slowing down isn't constant, however. The earth speeds up occasionally and we don't need to add leap seconds quite so often. 
When was the longest solar day on record? 
I suspect the answer is sometime during the 1970s when leap seconds were a yearly occurrence. It is also possible I've made an error of understanding.
(If your answer is the Summer Solstice or the 25 hour DST day, that's not the type of day I'm asking about.)
