Meteors arriving to a planet's atmosphere?

Imagine a planet with little or no wind activity or precipitation, but that still has an atmosphere. When a meteoroid reaches the atmosphere and burns, it converts into dust and gas. Does this gas and dust stay in the atmosphere then? Can there be permanent solid particles (like dust) in the atmosphere that are so light that do not fall down to the ground after the meteroid burns?
