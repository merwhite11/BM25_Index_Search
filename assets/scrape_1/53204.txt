How commonly observed is H2 forming in H2O ice, among comets?

How common is H2 forming under a shell of normal ice, among comets?
The context is the Oumuamua discussion, and its latest tentative solution. "Acceleration of 1I/â€˜Oumuamua from radiolytically produced H2 in H2O ice" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05687-w
Is formation of H2 in comets has discussed for long "The possible formation of a hydrogen coma around comets at large heliocentric distances" https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988ApJ...324L..31B/abstract
...but has it been observed before? Or is Oumuamua perhaps its first observation?
