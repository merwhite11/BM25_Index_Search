What are the stars/constellations a beginner/enthusiast can easily identify?

I was just wondering what are some of the stars, constellations or any other things that one can just identify by looking up at the night sky.
For example, when ever i look up, I immediately see Orion and can identify Betelgeuse, Rigel, Bellatrix. Apart from that i can identify some of the bright stars liike sirius , vega.
So, what other stars are there that one can easily identify and point?
