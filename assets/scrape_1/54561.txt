How are the Extremely Large and Thirty Meter Telescopes coming along ("planned 2027")

The graphic above is oft-cited in SE questions and answers. I was (a little) sad to see in it that the 100 meter telescope-engineering wunderkind Overwhelmingly Large Telescope or "OWL" has been canceled, leaving the Extremely Large (37 meter) and Thirty Meter (30 meter) Telescopes coming along ("planned 2027") to become the (seemingly) largest two single-aperture optical telescopes for quite some time into the future.
Are they both coming along nicely and on-track for first light circa 2027, now only 4 years away?
