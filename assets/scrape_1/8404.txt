How to see Saturn's rings through a pair of binoculars?

I have a pair of 15x70 binoculars. I would not say what manufacturer to avoid being the subject of 'hold'.
The current angular diameter is 15.5 arcseconds. I am wondering if that condition is enough to be able to see rings. My eyesight is fair.
