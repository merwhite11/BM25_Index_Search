Formation of elements in the Sun other than helium

I just learned that the Fraunhofer lines of the Sun's spectrum indicate that the Sun contains various elements other than just hydrogen and helium (for example, Na and Fe) but don't the Sun's p-p chain reactions only involve hydrogen and helium? So where do these other elements came from?
