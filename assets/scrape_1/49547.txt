Is there a cosmological model of the evolution of vacuum motion in our universe over time?

Is there a cosmological model of the evolution of vacuum motion in our universe over time?
Does this model starting from a non-vacuum constitute an advantage compared to the cosmological model of matter?
At Planck's Wall there was not much vacuum but condensed matter in a small space less than 10^-35 m and the closer to the starting anomaly the more vacuum would be absent, so the anomaly begins with a nonempty in this model.
Clearly as we can see the displacement of matter and study it, nothing prohibits in theory to study the displacement of vacuum too.
And the advantage with this model is that the initial anomaly disappears and will start with a non-empty, and we will not have the appearance of infinity which will allow us to find the equation at all...
