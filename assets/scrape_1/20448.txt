How large can a ball of water be without fusion starting?
Peculiar question: some explanation might be necessary. My young son is into ‘space’ and astronomy. One of his posters says that Saturn could float, if a sufficiently large ocean could be found. Obviously that wouldn’t work: Saturn’s atmosphere would peel off and join or become the atmosphere of the larger body, and then Saturn’s dense core would sink.  
But could such an ocean even exist without fusion starting?
