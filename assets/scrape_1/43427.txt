Why does rotation prevent the further contraction of the cloud?

In the book Horizons: Exploring the Universe (2018) by M.Seeds and D.Backman, chapter 9, page 170-171, it states that:

At least four factors resist the
compression of an interstellar gas cloud, and those factors must
be overcome by gravity before star formation can begin. [...]
Third, everything in the Universe rotates. As a gas cloud begins
to contract, it spins more and more rapidly, just as ice-skaters
spin faster as they pull in their arms. This rotation can become
so rapid that it resists further contraction of the cloud.

Which bring the question of why does rotation prevent the further contraction of the cloud? Doesn't the rotation create a centripetal force that pointed inside, thus make the matters become denser, therefore it shouldn't be a reason that interstellar have to overcome in order to form stars?
