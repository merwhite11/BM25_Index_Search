Any benefit for analyzing the depth of craters across the surface of a planet?

I would like to know what conclusions one could draw from mathematically analyzing the depth of various craters across the surface of a given planet, and then relating that to their position on said planet. Note that I am not looking for immediate conclusions, but rather conclusions that could actually benefit manned exploration in that region. Thanks!
