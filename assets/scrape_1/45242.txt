Are satellites of trans-Neptunian objects classified as trans-Neptunian objects?

I can't seem to get a consistent answer regarding the question of whether or not satellites (moons) of trans-Neptunian objects are considered to be trans-Neptunian objects, given that they do not orbit the sun directly. Any help clarifying this issue would be greatly appreciated.
