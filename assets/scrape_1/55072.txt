Would water freeze on Neptune?

Someone told me that water would boil on Neptune because of the pressure. But this seems suspect to me. Given a temperature of -353 Fahrenheit, I'd expect water to freeze pretty much instantly. So would water freeze on Neptune, or boil? How long would it take for either to occur?
