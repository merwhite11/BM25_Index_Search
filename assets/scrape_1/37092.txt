What observatories provide data similar to USNO?

USNO (the United States Naval Observatory) generates positions for the celestial bodies (planets, moons,stars) and provides them in the form of .bsp files and their Astronomical Almanac.
Is there any alternative open publication produced by EU or other big countries?
