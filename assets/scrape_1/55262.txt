Seeking Recommendations for Libraries or Software for Creating 2D/3D Physics Animations

Hello Physics Overflow community,
I'm currently delving into the world of physics simulations and am in search of software or libraries that can help me create detailed and aesthetically pleasing 2D and 3D physics animations. My goal is to visualize complex physical phenomena in a way that's both accurate and visually engaging.
Specific Needs:

Capability for 2D and 3D Animations: I'm interested in tools that can handle both two-dimensional and three-dimensional animations.
Physical Accuracy: The software should be capable of accurately representing physical concepts and principles.
User-Friendly: While I have a reasonable background in physics and some programming experience, I'm looking for tools that are relatively easy to learn and use.
Compatibility: I prefer tools that are compatible with major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) or web-based platforms.
Customizability: The ability to customize animations (colors, textures, lighting) would be a significant plus.

Context:
I've worked with basic programming languages and have some experience with simple simulation tools, but I'm now looking to create more advanced and visually appealing content, possibly for educational purposes or presentations.
Questions:

What software or libraries would you recommend for creating high-quality physics animations?
Are there any specific tools that are favored in the academic or educational community for this purpose?
If you have personal experience with such tools, could you share how steep the learning curve might be and any resources that helped you?

Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your assistance!
