How does gravity have an effect from the inside the event horizon of a black hole with the rest of the universe?

According to general relativity, as I understand it, the space around a black hole's event horizon is distorted by gravity, such that the distance to a point approaching the event horizon from an observational point further out from the EH approaches infinity.
So if the distance to any mass inside the EH appears to be infinite, how does this mass assert gravitational effects outside the EH?
Perhaps a different question, what is the difference between the gravitational effects of a mass inside the EH of a black hole and a similar mass that is outside the cosmic event horizon of an observational point?
(edit as follows)
My original intent for this question is rethink how we think about black holes.  The distance to a point on the event horizon of Sag A is as far to the point on an observer's cosmic event horizon.  You can travel no farther than such a point on the CEH than you could to a point on Sag A's event horizon, at least using our 4D coordinate system.  BTW, I think all talk about a black hole having a singularity at its center is bunk, first of all, we can never get there to confirm or deny. Secondly, the density of Sag A if it were uniform, would mathematically would be around the density of liquid water as it exists on earth, but we would never be able to know, just as we would we would ever be able to know the density of the universe outside of our cosmic event horizons.  Any answers to those two questions would be meaningless anyway, as long as there is no away around the speed of causality rule enforced by our universe.  
Now I believe I have read that Hawking Radiation has been shown to exist.  However, does that mean the part of whatever is outside our cosmic event horizon is evaporating as well?
