Is the 'spin' of Earth and the 'spin' of Mars a significant contribution to their angular momentum?

Is the 'spin' of Earth and the 'spin' of Mars taken into account as a contribution to the conservation of angular momentum? (and a contribution to the increasing/decreasing eccentricity?) Or - is the spin regarded as too small to be measurable?
