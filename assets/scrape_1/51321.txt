Does the observed sky change when solar system passes through a spiral arm of Milky way?

According to density wave theorem, some other questions here [and my basic understanding from it] the spiral arms of an spiral galaxy are fixed regions of space around it with higher gravity, where the "passing stars" undergo a higher gravitation between themselves and somehow slow down; just like some galactic speed bumps for stars. As the stars and matter pass through this speed bumps, they slow down, bust some new stars and after passing it, gonna speed up again.
The question however is, when a known observed star or sky region which is in front of us, passes through this arms, the distance between us decreases considerably because they are slowed down and we are not, and the observed sky region would seem distorted significantly. Since it takes 230 million earth years to have one orbit around milky way, the milky way has about 4~6 arms, the observable distance of sky for us is far enough, the chances of this phenomenon is quite high while in reality, we don't see distortions like this.

Here is a simple drawing to present my question. The red dots are earth and an observed star:

Which part of my simple modelling is wrong?
I'm an amateur cosmology Wikipedia article-jumper, so forgive me if I get things wrong.
