Tidal locking of Moon

Since our Moon is tidally locked with earth, we always see only one side of the Moon. In such a case, how and when did mankind first realize that the Moon is also revolving around its own axis? or for that matter, it is revolving around earth as well? Although we (humans) might have logically deduced that the Moon will have an hidden side (the side behind the visible side), but that need not mean that the moon is revolving. It could simply be that only one side of the Moon is facing earth...- as if it is permanently locked in that position. What made us imagine it could be revolving around itself and around Earth?
