the more concentrated the mass, the more powerful is gravity?

the more concentrated the mass, the more powerful is gravity? or does it depend exclusively on the total mass? example: 1 $\small\mathsf{cm^3}$ material A = 1000 kg, 20 $\small\mathsf{cm^3}$ material B = 2000 kg
which of the two generates more powerful gravitational force?
