How much of the celestial sphere can a naked eye observer see?

Yeah I know, 'Half'.  But if you're in the middle of the pacific Pacific, where the surface curvature is greatest(?), with the sun and moon are at opposition, the nadir, on a cloudless night, even sitting in the bottom of a row(ing) boat, you're looking down a tangent cone to infinity, which is looking below the plane of the equator projected on the celestial sphere.  How much?
