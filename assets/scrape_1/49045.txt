Is it possible to block the surrounding light in a solar eclipse if we made the moon bigger or closer to the earth?


Is it possible to block the surrounding light in a solar eclipse if we made the moon bigger or closer to the earth? In an eclipse, you always see a ring of light surrounding the moon, but I am wondering if it's possible to completely block any light so you only see a dark circle in the sky. How much bigger does the moon have to be in order to achieve that?
