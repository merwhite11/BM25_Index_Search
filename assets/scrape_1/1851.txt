Why is a meteorite impact on the moon visible as white light?

You can watch a video of a meteorite impacting the moon at the npr.org website. 
Why does the impact produce white light?
I understand that the impact is like an explosion, but there is no air on the moon to burn material. If it was the result of superheating rock from the impact, then why does it fade so fast. White light emitted by heated rocks should last longer as it takes time to cool.
We can see meteorites breaking up in Earth's atmosphere as a streak of light, but there is no atmosphere on the moon.
So why isn't it just a big black puff of smoke?
