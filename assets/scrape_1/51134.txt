Farthest distance two objects are "gravitationally bounded", considering expansion of the Universe

The narrative is: "on greater scales the expansion of the Universe dominates, but on smaller scales gravitationally bounded objects still stay bounded". But how small is meant by "smaller scales"?
Galaxy superclusters are the biggest gravitationally connected objects in the recent (low z) Universe. How big (for given mass $M$) can they be before the expansion tears them apart?
For spherical mass $M$ and current epoch (and current value of expansion parameter $\Lambda$) - how far the closest unbounded object be?
Can a graph be built for "unbounding" distance as a function of $M$?
