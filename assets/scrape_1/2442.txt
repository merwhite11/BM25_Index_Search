Determine north just by one shadow

I am not sure if this is the right place to post at, but I tried to find the best place to do so.
To my point, I wonder if it is posssible, to determine where north is, just by one shadow, that means no Sun, no time, just a shadow in a picture or video...
Do you get my point? Like this picture, can I tell where north is?
