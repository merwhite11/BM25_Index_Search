Will an overspun black hole be white?

I recently watched a Kurzgesagt video about destroying black holes. In the video, they mentioned that you can (theoretically) "overspin" a black hole to remove its event horizon, thereby creating a naked singularity. Now the way I think this works is that in an overspun black hole, the ergosphere makes you move so fast you always miss the event horizon. This would effectively allow light to "reflect" off the now-nonexistent event horizon. Wouldn't that mean that the black hole either becomes a white color or a perfect mirror? If it does, then we can't see the singularity and the cosmic censorship hypothesis holds. I admit this is based on my own understanding, so there's probably a flaw in my reasoning somewhere here.
