Boise ID 6:55pm 2 lights in a row brighter than Jupiter -disappeared

Ok there is another question like this from a month ago.  I am in Boise Idaho, and at 6:55 PM MST Nov 15, 2022, two lights brighter than Jupiter were about an inch to the north and east.  The two lights and Jupiter made almost a straight line.  I had enough time to pull out my star map to see if they were other planets- they were not. They then got brighter and then faded out.
Similar it sounds to another post from a month ago. Not Jupiter moons not Neptune which is to the west. Not satellites. No movement. What are possible explanations for these?
