Converting UTC (10 digit) to LST (Local Sidereal Time)

I am an astro-particle physicist looking for some simulation based on the experiment observation.
The simulation dataset contains 10 digit Epoch dataset for UTC time, however, I need to convert this into LST.

Fortunately, I could find a converting website for 10 digit Unix epoch to actual UTC time, however, I could not find out how could I convert it into LST.
Local Sidereal Time
Here is also a formula but I don't know the formula for UTC to UT (Universe time), so I don't think using this will help me a lot for my purpose.
If anyone can offer me nice converting formula, it would be great.
