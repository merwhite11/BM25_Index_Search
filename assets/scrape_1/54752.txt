What spectroscopic methods are there?

It was said in a comment on this site that there are different ways spectroscopy can be achieved. I am therefore asking: What methods are available when doing spectroscopy on the composition of planets in our solar system? If you have valuable information to share, please explain the workings of each of these. Didn't find what I was looking for on the net.
