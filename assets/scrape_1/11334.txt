Any freely available large stellar spectra catalog?

For a non-astronomy personal project I would like to have a large set of optical stellar spectra combined with absolute magnitude when available. I search for a dataset that contains 10k - 10M objects, with total compressed size below 100Gb (ideally below 10Gb), is freely available via ftp/http/rsync and machine-readable. Presence of most 'naked eye visible' stars and their individual names in the set is desired, but not required. 
I know that some digital survey data are freely available via FTP, so maybe some reasonable spectral data catalog exists as well? 
Note, I'm planning to download the data for local processing, so retrieving them through on-line forms (or even automated http interfaces) is undesirable.
The best I was able to find is this catalog  . Dropping aside that FITS is not something I'm used to (this apparentrly can be rectified) it is too small. I'd like at least 1k stars, 10k preferable. There is apparently a lot of surveys in 0.1-10k objects range that are focused on specific type of stars (say, nearby M-class dwarfs) and stellar libraries containing spectral data on representative objects from various classes. However I'd like a 'representative set' here, which contains stars of various nature in proportion similar to their 'natural abundance' in some region. An example would be the set of stars of solar neighborhood above, but again it's too small.
