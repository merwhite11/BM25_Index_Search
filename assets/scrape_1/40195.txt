If rotation has nothing to do with gravity, why do astronomers always link swirling dust and gas to stellar evolution?

All my life I was taught in school that we have gravity because the earth spins.  Now I know that is not true.  Online academics were baffled why anyone thought so. I can only say that's what they said in school.
But if gravity is more mass and everything in the universe has some gravitational "pull", then why do astronomers always use spinning and whirling dust and gas as a way to explain stellar evolution?  They make it sound like the spinning around created the gravity to form the mass and the bigger it got the more it spun and made more gravity.
