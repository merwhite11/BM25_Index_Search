What causes the abundance of dust to 'float' in the thin lunar atmosphere?

Several missions to the Moon have revealed a lunar horizon glow, such as the ones seen below by the spacecraft Surveyor 7 in 1968:

According to the NASA article "Model Helps Search for Moon Dust Fountains" written in 2010 suggests the cause of the phenomenon is due to sunlight shining through a dust layer suspended in the very thin atmosphere (exosphere) of the moon.  From the NASA webpage:

"It has been suggested that electrostatic forces play a role in the ejection of dust from the lunar surface, and its dynamics in the atmosphere, but we really donâ€™t understand how it gets there in such high abundances." 

Given that there is no wind or precipitation in the lunar sky, my question is:
