Gas giants and seismology

A long time ago I read a very interesting way of studying the sun's internal structure via sound waves. This new field of study, probability already known here, is called helioseismology.
How much can we learn from gas giants by "listening" to sound waves?
Somewhat tangent to the question: Does this extend to all other kind of giants such as hot Jupiter, ice giants, etc...?
