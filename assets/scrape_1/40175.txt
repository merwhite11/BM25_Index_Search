Naming convention for multiple star systems

Okay, so I've seen different notations for the stars in Î² Capricorni. Some sources state that the stars are Aa, Ab1 and Ab2, Ba, and Bb, while others say that they are Aa, Aba and Abb, Ba, and Bb. So, what is the proper way to name stars in a multiple star system, and are there any exceptions to this convention?
