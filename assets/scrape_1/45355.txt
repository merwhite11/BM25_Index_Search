From where the light comes?

Gravitational field of a supermassive blackhole is so strong that even light cannot escape from it (eg. black hole in the core of M87). In this case when a blackhole tears a star,a bright disk of accelerating gas makes easier for us to spot blackholes. but the question is, if black holes pulls all the EM rays into it, how we can see the light from the disk ?. How X-rays are detected if it pulls all the EM rays into it ?.
