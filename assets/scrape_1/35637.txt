Is the equinox absolutely true east everywhere?

I've read that only only in the equinoxes do you get to see the sun rise in the exact east regardless where you might happen to be. However I think this is not absolutely true everywhere, but only in the equator, and in the south the Sun will rise just a tiny bit to the north, but this tiny bit to the north is negligible due to how far the Sun is from Earth. If this reasoning is correct, when would the 'true' equinox be for any country in the south? Can you provide an example and how you did it, please?
