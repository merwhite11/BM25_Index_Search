Why don't we build an interferometer between Earth and the Moon?

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) does interferometry from an array of telescopes spread all across Earth. The data is locally stored on a hard drive and shipped to a central location, so the telescopes in the array don't need to be connected to each other in real time. Would it be possible to make an EHT-like interferometer with telescopes on the Earth and on the Moon? It seems like such a telescope would have a much higher resolution than the EHT, and would make it possible to observe in wavelengths shorter than radio. 
Of course, money is likely an issue here, but is there any technical reason why this wouldn't be feasible?
