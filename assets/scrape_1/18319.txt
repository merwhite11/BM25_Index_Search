How far apart are stars in Terzan 5 cluster?

I've just learned about the Terzan 5 globular cluster, which according to Wikipedia has one of the highest star densities in our Galaxy - $10^6\ M_\odot/\mathrm{pc}^3$.
Problem is, I've no idea how to interpret this number. 
So, the question is, what are the distances between stars in that cluster on average?
