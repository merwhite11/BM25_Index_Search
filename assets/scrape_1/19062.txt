Buying a telescope for the first time. How important is the focal ratio and is a computerised telescope worth it?

I'm wanting to purchase a telescope for the first time. I've narrowed it down to 2 options based on what I've discovered from researching and my price range. I mainly want do planetary observations and some deep space. The 2 options that I've found are the following

Celestron 114 LCM Computerized Telescope
Orion 9851 SpaceProbe 130 EQ Reflector Telescope

From what I've gathered, both do have decent specs for what I want to do but I'm still a bit lost when it comes to the aperture and focal length. The Celestron 114LCM has a 1000mm focal length but the aperture is only 114mm where the Orion 130 has a 900mm focal length but a 130mm aperture. Am I right in thinking that the Orion telescope would be better for me? Also, with the Celestron telescope it is computerised so, although the fun would be taken out of messing around with the scope and feeling satisfied with the results, is it really worth it to have this feature for a first time purchase? Thanks in advance!
