Are sunspots named or individually tracked?

This is a follow-up question to How are the solar flares from May 23, 2021 extraordinary? which is about news of spaceweather.org. In the present question, I am curious solely about sun-spots and why some of them seem to have names like AR2824, and how they are tracked.
So what exactly is that name? Can I find a history about each sun-spot? How are sunspots tracked?

Is there a database of past sunspots?
