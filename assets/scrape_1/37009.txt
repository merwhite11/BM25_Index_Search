Why Comet C/2020 F3 Neowise returns even it's orbit is near- parabolic?

I have read in Wikipedia about  Comet C/2020 F3 Neowise that it's orbit is near-parabolic. But in another section, it says that it is a non-periodic comet whlith orbital period ranging from 4500 years to 6800 years.
My doubt is how a comet returns back if it is in a parabolic orbit and why it is non-periodic?
