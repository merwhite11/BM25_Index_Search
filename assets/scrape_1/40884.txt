Can we visually perceive exoplanet transits with amateur telescopes?

Is it possible for an amateur astronomer to visually perceive an exoplanet transit by the change of brightness of the star via observations spaced over time, or is the variation of the brightness too insignificant to be seen?
I have a 70mm scope, but no astrophotography equipment or software to compare data. My question is about really perceiving the brightness variation with our own eyes over time as we see it on variable stars.
