Why did Jupiter spiral into the inner solar system?

We know over 4 billion years ago, Jupiter was created and started to head into the inner solar system until Saturn pulled Jupiter back out. In fact, we wouldnâ€™t be here if Jupiter stayed inside the inner solar system. My question is, what force pulled Jupiter inside the inner solar system in the first place?
