Why do we say that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, when they can escape a black hole and light cannot?

Or rather, does "speed" relate to the same measure? The speed of light is the speed of a photon/an electromagnetic wave in the empty space, but gravitational waves are wave of this very same space? How to make sense of it in a more formal way?
