How dark are eclipses of Jupiter's moon by the planet?

On Earth, an eclipse of the Sun (by the Moon) can get pretty dark, but not as that dark as a regular night. Usually it would look like civil twilight at maximum darkness.
This is primarily because of scattered light in Earth's atmosphere.
On the Galilean moons of Jupiter, eclipses of the Sun happen quite often. How dark will it get for an observer on the surface of one of Jupiter's moons during a solar eclipse by the planet?
