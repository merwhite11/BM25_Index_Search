Astronomy online degrees

I have a masters degree in computer science and statistics but would like to advance my knowledge in astronomy, ideally in getting some kind of online degree. 
Does anybody have experience, suggestions or recommendation where I can do what without having to be physically present at a university? 
Also, I would like to get view on what specific topics in astronomy it would make sense to focus if my skills are mainly in computer science and data analysis?
