Are high-speed galactic collisions survivable?

This is a hypothetical question, but it really is meant as a vivid way of asking about the affects of high-speed galactic collisions. The November 27 APOD showed the Cheshire Cat galaxy group, and the caption says that the "eyes" are two large elliptical galaxies, closing on one another at over 1000 km/s, and bathed in a glow of X-rays from heating of the associated interstellar media.
How intense is this glow? I suspect it is very faint, but I don't know how to quantify it. Would it hinder X-ray astronomy for residents of the galaxies? Would it be strong enough to affect life? Does anybody have quantitative information and know how to interpret it? (I do realize that elliptical galaxies are thought to be made up of old, low-metallicity stars that aren't good candidates for habitable planets, but let's ignore that.)
