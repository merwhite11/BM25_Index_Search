What determines how accurate a particular method is at finding the period between Lomb-Scargle and String Length Minimization?

I've been using the Lomb-Scargle and String Length Minimization methods to find the periods of various astronomical objects with unevenly spaced data. I wanted to see if I could find any patterns between the two that could determine why a particular method was more accurate in one case but not another.
Unfortunately, I'm not having much luck. In pretty much every case, String Length is always more accurate. In only one case did the Lomb-Scargle and String Length find the exact same period.
There don't seem to be any patterns between the number of data points or the time between observations. I've looked at different objects including different variable stars, and asteroids. etc. I did notice that String-Length was able to find the actual period for objects that have two minima and two maxima (like asteroids and eclipsing binaries), but the period found by the Lomb-Scargle had to be doubled.
What determines how accurate each of these methods is? So far, I don't how I could ever recommend somebody uses Lomb-Scargle when it's much less accurate in comparison to String Length Minimization in 99% of cases.
