Redshift quantization

A full disclosure to begin with: I'm a PhD student in mathematics and while I understand most of standard cosmological-astronomical terms and I've followed a one semester course on cosmology, I don't really have a deep comprehension of the well known material neither on cosmology or astronomy. 
I've recently heard about the possibility of a "redshift quantization". As I understood this is not a mainstream result, which means that as 2007 was still quite debated. Anyway I couldn't understand if it really was ruled out by some more recent observations or if it's a still ongoing idea. But to be more specific what I really don't understand are the implications of this result and if this result would invalidate some current cosmological theory and why. I've heard it might have some implication on Quasar formation and change the current timeline of the Big-bang but didn't get how nor why.
Can anybody give me some hints?
