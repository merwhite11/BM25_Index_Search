Is the LSST (Vera C. Rubin) telescope going to change position every 20 or 35 seconds?

This is a very particular question, I realize, but I am still curious...
The Vera Rubin telescope is supposed to take a 15-second exposure, then take 5 seconds to move to its next spot...
But I also read that it will take two consecutive 15-second exposures at each stopping point, then spend 5 seconds moving to its next position...
On Wikipedia, in the middle of the article on the Vera C. Rubin LSST Telescope, two consecutive paragraphs contradict each other, the first saying it will spend only 15 seconds at each spot before moving on, and the second saying it will take two consecutive 15- second exposures at each point.....
