How one can establish that the Earth is round?

I am asking this question out of curiosity.
Currently, I am reading the book: A Brief History of Time. In Chapter 1, the author discusses about Aristotle's conclusions about spherical Earth.
For example: At horizon, one sees the top of the ship first and then its base. Also, the shadow casted by Earth on the Moon's surface is round during the lunar eclipse. Thus, one can conclude that the Earth is round.
In what other way, one can conclude that the Earth is round? Obviously, without observing it from a space station or using some modern technology. Or put in other way, what are some other evidences, that people in Before Common Era used to conclude that the Earth is indeed round?
