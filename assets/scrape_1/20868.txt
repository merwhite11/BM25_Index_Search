Has the microwave background radiation ever been blocked in order to prove it's really from the sky?

A rather stupid question but I was just curious if the radiation could be virtual.  From the instrument....sort of like virtual particles. In other words if you just build a sensitive microwave detector and stick it in a South African Durban Deep gold mine 5 miles under the earth would it do the same thing?
