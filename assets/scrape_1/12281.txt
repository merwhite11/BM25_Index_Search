What is in the brightest area of the night sky?

When I look up in the night sky, I assume the brightest area, commonly known as "The Milky Way", is the Galactic Center of our home galaxy. 

But then I stumbled upon this illustration, which seems to suggest what I'm seeing is (and by far) not the Galactic Center. In fact, from this picture it looks like the brightest area might be the closest spiral arm (on the opposite direction of the galactic center).

I know this illustration is not meant to be precise, so it's probably not the closest spiral arm either. 
So, what am I really looking at when I stare at the brightest spot of the night sky? What percentage of it would be stars, planets, and nebulae? And what's the farthest object I can see in that direction with my unaided eyes?
