Ghost images coronado telescope

I have just purchased a Coronado Solarmax III 70mm. To make it clear I am not an astronomer or an astrographer. I just need the telescope for an art installation purpose. I am having trouble with multiple ghost images of the sun. Any suggestions what might be the problem? Thanks in advance.
