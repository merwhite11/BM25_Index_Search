Identify stars in image from James Webb

This is one of the recent pictures from the James Webb released by NASA. It's a picture of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723. It locates in the Volans constellation.

I'm trying to identify the stars in this picture. For example, which star does the brightest one in the middle correspond to in the following picture of Volans constellation?
