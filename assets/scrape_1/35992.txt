Orphaned star systems and intergalactic travel (in fictional context)

Context:
I'm looking for some authority on a particular idea that I brought up in regards to a new update brought out for a space travel sim game, Elite Dangerous
The vessels in that game can travel between star systems, requiring fuel- they can only jump between star systems, and have a limit on how many light years they can travel in one jump.
The latest update added a vessel that can jump up to 500 light years.
Vessels can't travel continuously to a location, it has to be point to point, i.e. teleportation (sort of)
The question:
Given the context above, can it be estimated that there are enough high orbiting, or orphaned star systems between the edge of the milky way, and the edge of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy for one of these vessels to traverse a 'corridor' of 500ly (or closer) intervals of star systems between the two galaxies?
