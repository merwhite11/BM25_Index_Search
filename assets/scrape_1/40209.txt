Why is the solar wind most powerful near the heliosphere?

I've read this article, titled, "Voyager Mission Finds a New Type of Electron Burst at The Edge of Our Solar System". They state that,

Carried to the fringes of our Solar System by the shock waves of solar
eruptions known as coronal mass ejections, these energised particles
appear to accelerate even beyond the borders of our Sun's powerful
winds.
"The idea that shock waves accelerate particles is not new,"
notes astrophysicist Don Gurnett from the University of Iowa. 
He says similar processes have been observed within the borders of our
Solar System where solar wind is most powerful.

I would think that everything slows down, maybe not so much in the vacuum of space, but why would these particles continue accelerating?
