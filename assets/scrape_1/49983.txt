What percentage of visible stars will JWST be able to survey over the next 10 years?

The James Webb telescope is projected to stay operational over the next 10 years. During this time, what percentage of the visible universe/stars will it be able to survey? Of course, technically the answer is 100% if it just takes wide-angle photos of the sky, so I'm curious about "surveying" at the highest possible resolution available on the satellite.
