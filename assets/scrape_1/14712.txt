Why do meteorites explode?

Some meteorites just blaze away, streaking through the sky. This is clearly explained, as they either slow down enough for the flame to cease, or ablate in their entirety, turning to vapor.
But some, like the Chelyabinsk meteorite, explode violently.
What effect is responsible for this?
Can it be that with their irregular surface acting as a turbine they enter a spin of increasing speed, and once the centrifugal force reaches a certain level, it causes the meteorite to break apart rapidly, hurling parts of it in all directions at speeds far exceeding its speed so far?
