What were the 2 satellites I saw this morning?

This morning at 6:03am Israel time (3:03 UTC) I saw, simultaneously, what appeared to be 2 satellites streaking across the sky directly overhead. If I remember correctly, they were both coming from NW (but it was early).
Does anybody know what they were, or how I can find out?
I live in Mitzpe Netofa, lon/lat about 35.39/32.80.
