How can the JWST telescope detect matter “shortly” after the big bang?

Since space is expanding, and accelerating, with distant locations accelerating at such a high rate that they are receding at greater than the speed of light, how can the Webb detect these distant objects.
I have read that the size of the “visible universe” is decreasing with time because of the expansion. Infrared energy propagates at the speed of light in vacuum.
So I'd like to ask how the JWST telescope can detect matter “shortly” after the big bang?
