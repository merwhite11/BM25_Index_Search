Wavelength Calibration in Python - Line Identification algorithm

I was asked to develop a data reduction pipeline for a telescope and am facing a problem. 
I have the standard lamp spectra and need to identify the emission lines in order to find a wavelength solution to apply to the spectra taken.
I managed to find the signal peaks and calculate their centroids, I am unsure - however - of how to match the centroids I found with a list of the emission lines of the lamps.
I basically have to do what "Identify" in IRAF does, but in python. I know there have been some packages that do that (like specutils), but they are outdated and recall deprecated libraries.
Any tip on where to go or what to do to have a centroid-wavelength match would be greatly appreciated.
