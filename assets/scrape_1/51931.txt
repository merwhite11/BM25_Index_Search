What does Dark Energy explain other than the accelerated expansion of the universe?

Dark energy is a vital part of standard cosmology and allows for an explanation of the accelerated expansion of the universe. Does it explain anything else?
Or put into other words:
If a different theory (e.g. modified gravity) was able to explain the accelerated expansion and was consistent with all other fully understood aspects of cosmology, would dark energy still be a useful concept?
