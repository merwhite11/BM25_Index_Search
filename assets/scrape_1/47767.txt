How to fix James Webb space telescope?

(Please excuse my English)
The James Webb space telescope(JWST) will be launched in 11 days. I've always wondered, how do we fix the JWST if it breaks? The JWST will be too far away. According to Wikipedia, it will be about 1.5 million km from Earth, circling about 370,000 km from the Sun-Earth L2 point.
