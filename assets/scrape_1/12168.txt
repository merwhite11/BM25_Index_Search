How much of the ambient radiation on Mars is arriving line of sight from the Sun?

I read a lot about the amount of radiation bodies like the Moon and Mars receive, but it's hard to find information about where the radiation is coming from. It seems to me that it's cosmic radiation plus whatever is being radiating from the Sun. Would it be useful to build a habitat somewhere that's in perpetual shadow (e.g. deep crater), or to seek shelter in the shadow of a crater wall or mountain during a solar storm. Mostly I'm thinking about a habitat design for Mars, where the habitat will always be out of view of the sun. Sunlight could light the habitat via something like huge Mylar mirrors, that would not reflect much harmful radiation. But I'd like to know if the applies to the Moon.
