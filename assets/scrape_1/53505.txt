What part of a star's habitable zone has the best chance of developing life?

I was thinking about superhabitable worlds a while ago, and I figured the best position regarding probability of life would be nearer the outer habitable zone, since it's easier to develop a greenhouse effect than to counteract heat (excluding a red-giant phase). Am I right? I'm no professional...
EDIT 23/APR/2023: Sorry, I meant the current position of exoplanets in the current habitable zone of a star, though the answers thus far have been enlightening!
