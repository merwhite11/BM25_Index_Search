Celestron 130 EQ astromaster

I brought this 130 EQ telescope and set it up following the manual. I checked collimations and seemed alright, the usual 3 clips with the black solid circle in the middle crisscrossed by the spider veins.
I checked the moon and it shows nice and bright with some really nice details. I was able to locate mars and jupiter and its 3 moons. Mars had its orange hue but was very small. Both looked really bright but very tiny. when i increase the magnification i see a white disc with the  spider veins for both. I am using a 20 mm eye piece. Just wondering if that is a right behavior? What can i do to see a bigger image? I have not tried with the other 10 mm eyepiece that comes standard with the telescope. Any advice would be very much appreciated.
