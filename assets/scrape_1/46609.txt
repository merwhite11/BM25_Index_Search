Density and Velocity profiles of a self gravitating explosion

Suppose an asteroid explodes, into a spherically symmetrical cloud, of radius R, mass M, and surface receding velocity V (normal to the edge of the cloud), initially the density is radially uniform.
Can anything be explicitly stated with respect to the velocity profile with time, and the density profile. Although initially, the density profile is uniform, I suspect it is bound to change with time and result in a radially varying density profile.
I am unable to derive a relation between the velocity profile and the density profile at any time.
Also the max radius (radius when expansion ceases) according to me is independent of density and velocity profiles (initial or at any time t) and is
$$R_{MAX} =\frac{2GMR}{2GM-V^{2} R}$$
EDIT: I only seem to find information of a spherically symmetric collapse of such a cloud, not regarding an expansion, so another supplement question would be, is such an explosion bound to pulsate with time.
