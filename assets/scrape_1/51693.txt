In 2023, is space still thought to be "filled with a network of wormholes"?

The September 2009 YouTube music video Carl Sagan - 'A Glorious Dawn' ft Stephen Hawking (Symphony of Science) at about 00:30 depicts a clip from (what I think is) Carl Sagan's 13-part PBS television show Cosmos: A Personal Voyage where he says (removed from context):

Space is filled, with a network of wormholes... you might emerge somewhere else in space, or somewhenelse in time.

Question: In 2023, is space still thought to be "filled with a network of wormholes"?
