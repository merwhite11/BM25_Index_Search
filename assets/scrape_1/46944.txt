What does "TON" in TON 618 stand for?

I don't think TON 618 is a random name, but rather a composition of category name and a number.
But when I tried to google it, any article about TON 618 did not contain anything about its name origin and nor did lists about astronomy acronyms contained the term TON.
Even if I am wrong about the composition of category name with a number, I still cannot find any information about origin of its name.
So please, can anyone tell me how TON 618 got its name?
