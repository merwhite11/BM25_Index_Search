SNR computation + noise correlation

My question splits in two parts:

If I have an image with N x N pixels, and an object in the center (star, galaxy what have you), spanning M x M, how do I compute its signal to noise ratio exactly?

Now what happens if some (noise) pixels are actually correlated? How does that change the SNR computation?
