The face of the moon at moonset

It appears that the face of the moon "rotates" clockwise from the time the moon rises to the time it sets. Tycho's crater seems more to the left and the "Rabbits head" looks like it's facing down more.  
I know that is not actually the case but I am having trouble visualizing why this appears so. Can anyone explain?
