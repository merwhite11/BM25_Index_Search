What meteor shower has the radiant that appears furthest west after sunset, and why?

When it finally gets answered, answers to How to calculate the position of a meteor shower's radiant point based on its associated comet's orbit? will help us understand why the radiant points of meteor showers tend to be closer to east than west after sunset and before midnight, but some comet orbits could potentially produce meteor showers who's radiants could be near the zenith at sunset and set in the west around midnight.
Question: What meteor shower has the radiant that appears furthest west after sunset? What is it about the associated comet's orbit that makes this so?
