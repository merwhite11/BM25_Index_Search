Is Darkness Faster Than Light?

I've been looking around, and can't find a solid answer. Many websites say darkness is the speed of light due to the fact it is the absence of light, but other sources say otherwise, that in some cases darkness is actually faster in some cases. Could someone clarify this for me?
