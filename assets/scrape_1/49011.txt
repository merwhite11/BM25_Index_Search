Time dilation if an asteroid and a small black hole entered a larger black hole?

For an outside observer, everything moves slower the closer it is to a black hole's event horizon, even photons, due to the black hole's time dilation.
We also know that when two black holes collide, they are first orbiting each other for some time, and then they fuse in the fraction of a second (if they are small. The bigger they are, the longer the event takes).
But it has also been found rogue black holes that are travelling through cosmos. So even if it is extremely rare, it should also be possible for a black hole to collide with another black hole in the same way a bowlingball smashes into another bowlingball.
Does the merging of the two black holes happens just as fast in such an incident?
If it is, then we have this scenario:
An asteroid is travelling towards a black hole. On the other side of the black hole there is another, but smaller, black hole that is approaching too. The asteroid and the smaller black hole has about the same diameter and are travelling at the same speed. Both enter the gravity well of the larger black hole simultaneously, but from opposite directions.
The closer the asteroid comes the black hole's event horizon, the slower it moves for the outside observer. But what about the smaller black hole? Will that too seem to move slower the closer it comes its larger sibling's event horizon, or will it simply continue its path as if nothing slowed it down and then merge?
