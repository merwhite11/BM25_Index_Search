Can all areas on Earth experience a total solar eclipse?

A solar eclipse only puts part of Earth at a time in shadow, so I'm not talking about a solar eclipse that casts a shadow over all of Earth.
What I mean is: are there any areas on Earth where, no matter how Sol, Earth and Luna are aligned, a total solar eclipse is impossible? Can the penumbra cast a shade on any part of Earth, or are there certain areas where a penumbra due to a solar eclipse cannot occur?
