Formation of our Universe

So I got this information from a magazine , Scientific American issue Physics at the Limits. The theory is that our Universe came about, when in the "Bulk Universe", which is four dimensional, a four dimensional Star collapsed and formed a black hole which became our 3 dimensional "Brane Universe", in which we live. My question is, how could this one Star have contained all the material that is in our Universe ?
