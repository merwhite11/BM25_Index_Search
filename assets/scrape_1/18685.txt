How does the solar wind destroy the atmosphere of a planet lacking a magnetic field?

It is said that because Mars doesn't have a magnetic field its atmosphere disappeared, but how can solar wind cause that?
That the protons and electrons can changes molecules in an atmosphere I can understand, but how can solar wind cause molecules to escape from gravity?
Or is it that the atmosphere didn't escape in outer space but in contrary the molecules became too heavy, so they got solid and were pulled to the planet's surface?
