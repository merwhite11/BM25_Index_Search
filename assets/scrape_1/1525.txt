Time dilation on an object circling earth

How would a receiver on Earth hear a radio transmission from an object circling earth at 99% of the speed of light for 24 hours. The transmission from the object circulating would be non-stop.
Because time dilation would occur, would the transmission be slowed to the receiver? The object would travel so near earth that the signal would not have any delay reaching earth.
