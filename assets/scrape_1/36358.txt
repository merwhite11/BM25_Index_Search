Flux density from brightness map

This is a naive question. I have a temperature map of radio emission at 1420 MHz, in Kelvin. I want to extract the flux density (in Janskys) from an extended region of this map.
Is the flux density ($S_{\nu}$) from this region equal to
$$ S_{\nu} = \frac{2\nu^2 k_B T_{\text{mean}}}{c^2} \times A$$
where $\nu$ is the frequency of my map, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_{\text{mean}}$ is the mean value of the temperature inside my region, $c$ is the speed of light and $A$ is the area of my region in steradians?
