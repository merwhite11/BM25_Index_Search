Hydrogen and oxygen in space

chemistry tells us that when mixing hydrogen and oxygen the result is an explosion and water.
my question is: does this happen on astronomical scale? for example, did they ever observe planet-size hydrogen cloud collide with planet-size oxygen cloud to produce a huge explosion and planet made primary of water?
