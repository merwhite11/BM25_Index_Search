Longest line of sight on Mars

It is said that the slope of Olympus Mons is so gradual that the peak cannot be seen from the plain; it is hidden by the planet's curvature.  That provokes questions:

How steep is the steepest of the great volcanic peaks?
What is the longest line of sight between two points on the surface of Mars? (Perhaps it's between rims of Valles Marineris?)

I do not assume that the latter is known.
