What is a good way to start learning Astrophysics

I am a junior in high school and throughout my life I have always had a fascination with space. I use to watch "Space's Deepest secrets" and stuff like that but after a while I stopped learning much and became bored. Then I took an astronomy class in sophomore year which was fun until it ended. After that there wasn't much for me to do, but now I want to go from the beginning to the end. I want to learn and everything I can all over again, but this time I want to go farther. This is where my problem comes from, I have absolutely no idea where to start and would really appreciate any help that could be given.
