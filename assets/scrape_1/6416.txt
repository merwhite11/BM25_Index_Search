Is it conceivable that the presence of chlorophyll (or similar) could be distinguishable from other chemicals on an exoplanet?

If an Earth-like exoplanet had a sufficiently extensive plant biosphere (i.e large forests, aquatic algal mats etc), is it at all conceivable that scientists could spectroscopically detect the presence of biochemicals, such as chlorophyll, anthocyanins etc?
If possible, how would the spectra of these biochemicals be distinguished from other chemicals?
