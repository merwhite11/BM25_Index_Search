How many moons do we know are shepherds?

Shepherd moons are natural satellites near the edge of a planetary ring that have an influence on the shape and size of the ring due to their gravity. So it is possible for a satellite to be near the rings without being actually a shepherd. For instance, Pandora is on the outer side of Saturn's F ring, but isn't involved in shaping the ring, so it isn't a shepherd. On wikipedia, it says that we can't know if Cordelia and Ophelia are shepherds or not (I haven't found the reference for that yet, though) because we need better observations.
