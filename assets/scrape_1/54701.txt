Is the Venus's magnetosphere actually more powerful than the solar wind's magnetic field that induced it or vice versa?

Is the Venusian magnetic field actually more powerful than the solar wind's magnetic field that induced it? I know that Venus magnetic field is not due to Magnetohydrodynamic processes rather, it is induced via incoming solar wind which forms a bowshock and a magnetosphere, but is the magnetosphere stronger than the magnetic field of the solar wind particles
For example, in an transformer, analogy to Venus's magnetosphere, the transformer has a primary coil similar to solar wind, and a secondary one similar to the ionosphere. The solar wind is moving with a charge at ultra high speed which in turn creates a magnetic field, now this magnetic field comes close to the ionosphere and that due to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, then this current acts like an electromagnet and produces a magnetosphere via Ampere's law which fends off the solar wind, and prevents atmospheric escape. So is this a stepup transformer or stepdown transformer (I'm not an mechanic, but the analogy to transformer was simple)
My second question is that, what is the tesla values of the magnetosphere vs solar wind?, which will assist to decide that whether it is stepup or stepdown, since different sources give different result
Thank you in advanced!
