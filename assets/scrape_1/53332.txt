Are more stars or more galaxies cataloged, currently, and how has the ratio evolved over time?

I recall that there are of order 100 billion stars in a galaxy and 100 billion galaxies in the (observable) universe, or something roughly like that.
Since we are IN a galaxy we have an opportunity to cataloging a lot of stars!
However, being big, the observable universe offers a view of a lot of galaxies in a volume way way larger than that where individual stars are still bright enough to detect.
So I'm curious about the following.
Question(s):

Are more stars or more galaxies cataloged, currently?
How has the ratio evolved over time? Roughly?

For example, in antiquity, pre-telescopes, stars are going to win. Early telescopes helped Messier count 110 non-stelar objects and only a fraction of those turned out to be galaxies.
But once big telescopes and photographic plates and now CCDs and infrared (red-shift) systems and AI and crowdsourcing (eg. zooniverse) are here, perhaps galaxies have made a comeback?
