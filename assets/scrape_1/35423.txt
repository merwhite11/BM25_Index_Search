Binary star system effects at the barycenter

I haven't been able to find anything on this so far. Using Alpha Centauri as the study, what events/effects ( if any ) would happen between the two stars? More specifically, between the gravitational fields converging and the stellar winds, would there be anomalies that form between the two such as a nebula or cloud of charged particles that shimmer/bounce around because of the gravitational forces meeting.
