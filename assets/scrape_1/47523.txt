If Betelgeuse is exploding in 2022, why would we see the explosion in 2022?

I have heard a lot about Betelgeuse exploding in 2022. But, I had a doubt about this. Astronomers are still receiving signals from Betelgeuse. And if Betelgeuse is going to explode in 2022, then wouldn't we see the exploding of Betelgeuse in the night sky, 642 years later? Has Betelgeuse already exploded? If it has, how are astronomers able to still receive signals from Betelgeuse?
