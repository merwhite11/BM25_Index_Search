Formation and capture of Mars' moons, Phobos and Deimos

Mars's moons have the appearance of captured asteroids.  How could this capture have taken place.  An asteroid in solar orbit would need to loose some momentum to be captured.  The gas Giants can capture new moons through 3 body interactions between the asteroid and their existing moons,  but Mars doesn't have this issue. Airbreaking would lead to impact, not capture. 
An answer here suggests that the moons could have formed recently (millions of years, not billions) after an impact ejected a substantial amount of material in Martian orbit. What is the evidence for this?  Is there an impact crater of the right size, and age? Were both moons formed together?
