Brown Dwarf transcending past the sun with the naked eye

I seen with my naked eye in mid 2014 from Ca. right after sunrise a black spot in front of the Sun.I observed it for about a hour with my naked eye. Here is a picture that closely resembles what I observed, except the object was a third the size of the black dot in the posted picture and not in the middle of the sun but off to a angle.Since Venus did not transcend with the Sun in 2014 my speculation would have to say it might have been a Brown Dwarf.The link provided below of civilizations from the past documenting Venus transcending with the Sun throughout history could be observed with the naked eye,So a Brown Dwarf would be easier to see with the naked eye.The picture is from google and is the closest image I can give to what I seen.I have no knowledge of the picture and can not determine if it is real or fake.
