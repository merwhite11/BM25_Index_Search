How do I reduce planetary photometry to standard viewing geometry using phase angle?

I'm trying to make light curves for Pluto using old data. Most papers give magnitudes "reduced to standard viewing geometry" of r = 39.5 AU, Δ = 38.5 AU, and α = 1 degree, where r is heliocentric distance, Δ is geocentric distance, and α is phase angle. 
When papers give apparent magnitudes, I'm left to perform the reductions myself. I'm fine with the adjustment for r and Δ, but how do I reduce to phase angle of 1 degree?
I would also really appreciate a good source if you have it on hand.
