Use MOXIE on Earth

I recently read about a machine called MOXIE that synthesised oxygen from carbon dioxide on Mars. I haven't been able to get the exact idea of how the thing works(though I've noticed analogies to trees). So my question is, why can't we use this machine on Earth? We know the crisis global warming is causing, and such a machine might be just what we need to tackle climate change. But I strangely see that NASA has plans to use it for astronauts only. Why?
