Questions on apparent motion of superior planets

Question
Why is it that superior planets seem to oscillate up and down of the ecliptic, from the view of an observer on Earth, with a period equal to the planet's orbital period?
Additionally, why do these superior planets seem to come closer to the ecliptic when they are nearing conjunction and drift away from the ecliptic when they are near opposition?
Attempt
Does it have to do with the Earth's tilt?
