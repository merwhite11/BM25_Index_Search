Why doesn't the IAU definition of "Planet" disqualify Mercury and Venus as planets?

Here's the IAU definition of a planet (source):

A celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has
sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so
that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and
(c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. (p. 1)

Part b) is the sticking point. What qualifies whether something is assuming hydrostatic equilibrium? M. Burša gives the criterion in his 1984 "Secular Love Numbers and Hydrostatic Equilibrium of Planets":

(screenshot source). On the next page, Burša tabulates the k_s Love numbers for the major bodies:

Importantly, note the values of k_s = 237 and 293 for Mercury and Venus respectively. Burša concludes:

The secular Love numbers k_s computed (Table II) demonstrate that the actual state of Venus,  Mercury and of the Moon is far from hydrostatic equilibrium.

The oblateness of these bodies is incompatible with their rotation rates under pure hydrostatic equilibrium.
Please correct me if I have this wrong. It appears that the IAU definition of a planet excludes Mercury and Venus due to the hydrostatic equilibrium requirement, and that this has been clear since 1984.
