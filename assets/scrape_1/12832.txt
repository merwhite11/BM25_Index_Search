What earth organisms might survive if they arrived on Mars?

Contaminating other planets is a concern in space exploration. My question is what organisms, or small collections of organisms, from earth would be able form a self-sustaining population on Mars? I'm not worried about how they might get there, so deep sea microbes and the like which would have to be purposely transported are in scope.
This is not the same as the earlier question Could any known, living organisms on Earth survive on Mars? as that one does not consider sustainability.
