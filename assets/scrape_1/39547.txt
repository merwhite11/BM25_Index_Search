Photometry extinction correction magnitude

I am learning photometry and I am wondering is the uncorrected extinction instrumental magnitude always less than the corrected extinction instrumental magnitude when applying transformation coefficients?
For example suppose the uncorrected extinction instrumental magnitude is $m^A_V = 10.00,$ will the corrected extinction instrumental magnitude always be greater than $10$?
