Orbits using Newtons laws

I am making a small orbit simulator. I figured out Kepler's laws and know how to work with them to "update" an orbit based on time. So now I want to know how I can describe orbits with newton laws. Given a position vector and a velocity vector of a satellite, What I currently do is this:

Calculate gravitational acceleration: (g*mass)/distance^2
Add this number to the velocity vector.
Multiply the new velocity vector with the DeltaTime
Add it to the position vector
Go back to 1.

However when converting this to Keplerian Orbit Elements doesn't really make them constant.(Calculations from here: Cartesian To Kepler)
Also the orbit isn't really stable, and also wobbles around. So can anyone help me fix this? Or am I doing something wrong?
