Who first hypothesized that the universe is accelerating?

I couldn't find this answer anywhere.  Before 1998, was there a notable physicist who conjectured that the universe is accelerating and perhaps even submitted some equations to support it (and the existence of dark energy).  Such a hypothesis would likely have been rejected outright and fallen into oblivion, which is why I have to ask this question to get the answer.  And I don't mean Einstein's cosmological constant since he was trying to make the universe static rather than accelerating.  Someone who actually believed that the universe's expanding rate was increasing even before there was any evidence of it.
