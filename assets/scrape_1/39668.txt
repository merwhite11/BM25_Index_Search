Will the United States Presidential Election (day asteroid) be back soon?

My google news feed is awash with mono-themed articles, including a near Earth asteroid that passed by around election day 2020 in the US.
We can all hope that neither will lead to an extinction level event :-)
My question is about the asteroid itself.

Will 2018 VP1 pass close to the Earth again this century?
Did it before?
Does this current pass have any particularly notable or consequential "keyhole-like" impact on its future orbit?
