Satellite's orbit

What is the maximum distance for a satellite to orbit the earth? Does earth's gravity has the impact on satellite? I do know that earth's gravity will never be zero and it's gravity is inversely proportional to the distance.I heard that satellites escape earth's gravitational pull when they achieve a speed of 11kmph.How far it is true?
