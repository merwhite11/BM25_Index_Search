Amount of energy of the Big Bang

What is the currently accepted estimated range of the amount of energy of the Big Bang event?
In joules at some estimated size, so a temperature may be calculated.

For context, I wonder if the temperature of the Big Bang would make its heat radiation wavelength shorter than the Planck length.
