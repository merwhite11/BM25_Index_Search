Figuring out camera pitch and roll given RA and DEC of center of image, as well as lat,long of camera and time taken

What I am trying to figure out is how to get the camera pitch and roll, as described in this image  (the green yaw line is where the camera sensor is pointing
if given a RA, DEC (of center of image,ie where camera is pointing) LAT, LONG, roll from north celestial pole, az, and TIME
For example:
RA = 333.678881
DEC = 62.911565
ROLL_FROM_POLE = 92.904036
TIME = 10/26/22 16:51:05 UTC
LAT = -116.232476
LONG = 32.213847
AZ = 60

I feel like all the info is there to do this calculation but I'm having trouble fitting it together
for clarification: yaw would be directly related to azimuth and I already know azimuth so don't need that part., My intuition here says that says I know the location in the sky I'm looking (RA and DEC) as well as time/location/azimuth, I should be able to figure out what the camera/telescope orientation is.
