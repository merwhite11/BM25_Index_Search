How likely and severe is the threat of a gamma ray burst to earth?

In the National Geographic article: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/04/090403-gamma-ray-extinction_2.html it is suggested that a gamma ray burst likely caused a mass extinction in earth's history.  How severe is the threat of a gamma ray burst to life on earth?  It would be nice to see a chart that considers the threat within the next hundred years as follows (I have no idea what the actual numbers are, hence I am asking):
Severity - Likelihood in 100 years:

Global extinction - 0.0000001%
Major impact - 0.001%
Moderate impact - 0.1%
Minor impact (e.g. deplete ozone layer by 0.01%) - 10%
Observable - 100% ("minor" gamma ray bursts are frequently detected)

Follow up questions are: 

Would there be any warning of an impending severe gamma ray burst?
Could we survive in gamma ray burst shelters? (it would appear being underground may be sufficient according to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection#Shielding_design and http://2013.org/showthread.php/188-How-does-one-prepare-sufficiently-for-gamma-radiation-in-a-shelter-etc)

Something else I found to be shocking is that the Bible appears to predict such an event.  I would rate the predicted event on the major impact level.  I asked about this in the Christian Stack Exchange here:
