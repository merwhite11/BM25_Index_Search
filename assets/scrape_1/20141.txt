Star like lights at night

me and my friends likes to stargaze at night and every time we see this star like light that glides in one direction. they sometimes even cross in the middle then disappear sometime. i observed that it cant be seen if its too dark. we wondered what it could possibly be, we even make jokes that it was an alien craft that monitors our actions. we even nicknamed it "the fifth wave"(after the movie The Fifth Wave). its just something to wonder upon, really, but if you have something to share i'd be willing to read it and share it with my friends.
