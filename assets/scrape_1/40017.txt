When was the last time a great conjunction coincided with a solstice?

This December, a great conjunction will occur nine hours after winter solstice, which means that for much of the world the two events will be on the same day. When was the last time a great conjunction occurred within 24 hours of a solstice?
As a rough estimate, consider that there are 96 hours per year that are within 24 hours of a solstice. So you'd expect about 1% of great conjunctions to be within this window. Given that great conjunctions happen once every 20 years, a great conjunction and a solstice should occur within 24 hours about once every 2000 years.
