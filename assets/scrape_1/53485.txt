Have we observed other habitable planets like Earth?

Have we observed other planets within the “Goldilocks Zone” of a star to have reasonable temperatures, that have a breathable atmosphere, water, and gravity within a healthy range for human life?  Basically, have we observed another planet that could be colonized with very limited to no terraforming required?  Distance from us isn’t a factor in this question.  I’m also fine with answers that include planets that we think fit these metrics based off of our limited observation ability, but can’t necessarily confirm.
