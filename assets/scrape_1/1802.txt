What is that void that the universe is growing into?

We understand that this is the universe and it is essentially full of space and time, but what is on the outside of the universe, and isn't that nothing, something, and how far does that reach.
I.e. isn't that another aspect of the universe? For it to go into it, it must be something for it to go into it.
If I throw a ball through the air, the ball travels through air. If I throw a universe through the air so to speak, doesn't that have a characteristic, frame and limitation?
