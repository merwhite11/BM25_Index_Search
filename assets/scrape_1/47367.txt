TPoint software, INDAT command - Format 4 (ALTAZ)

I am working (in fact, trying to work) with TPoint for improving a solar telescope pointing calibration (SST, in Casleo, AR) and stumbled on the input data for INDAT command. SST is a multibeam solar observation telescope with Alt-Az support.
INDAT Observation record Format 4 is described as follows on the documentation:
star "observed" Az/El (째,째)
telescope raw Az/El (째,째)
[up to 2 auxiliary readings]

And the sample file for an AltAz support is mmt.dat, whose heading and 1st observational data row are follows:

MMT 1987 July 8

+31 41 19.6 1987 07 08 +15.0  734.5  2608.0 0.30

On the data rows, what would be the "column headers"?
