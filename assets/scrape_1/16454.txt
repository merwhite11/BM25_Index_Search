The Three Elements in the Milankovitch Cycles

According to the Serbian geophysicist Milutin Milankovitch, there are three elements that make an ice age possible:

Eccentricity (orbital shape):  Varying between 0.000055 and 0.0679 over the course of 100,000 years (1.0 being a perfect circle).
Obliquity (axial tilt):  Varying between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over the course of 41,000 years.
Axial precession (change in the orientation of the rotational axis on a rotating body):  Polaris being the North Star for a total of 26,000 degrees.

The question is how connected those three elements are, in the event someone wants to change the numbers in a worldbuilding process to make either a longer or shorter ice age:
Does the duration and extent of eccentricity affect those of obliquity and precession?
Or does the duration and extent of obliquity affect those of eccentricity and precession?
Or does the duration and extent of precession affect those of eccentricity and obliquity?
