What Types of Radiation Emanate in the Future and are Perceived in the Present?

Years ago I came upon a scientific text which mentioned different types of radiation and how they are perceived. One such form of radiation was described (from our perspective and understanding of space-time) to originate from the future and travel backwards through time.
I cannot for the life of me remember what this type of radiation was called and I would love to know it.
