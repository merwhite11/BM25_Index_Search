Can you explain the pattern of Hill sphere sizes of the objects of the Solar system?

I found this image on calculations of Hill sphere for planets/dwarf planets of the Solar system.

 From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hill_sphere_of_the_planets.png 
I found it interesting that variation of Hill sphere is intuitive for the first five planets, as the variation is similar to variation of mass/radius of those planets. Mercury has the smallest Hill sphere, Venus/Earth/Mars quite similar, and a giant leap from Mars to Jupiter.
But, Saturn has its Hill sphere bigger than Jupiter, even it is smaller than Jupiter. and this anomaly continues to Uranus and Neptune: They have progressively larger Hill spheres.
And Hill spheres of Pluto and Eris are quite larger than Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
This was quite surprising for me. Could someone explain why this—for the lack of a better word—anomalies are there?
