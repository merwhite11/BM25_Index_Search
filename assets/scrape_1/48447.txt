Can we estimate the orbital period of the planet Phaeton (destroyed planet between Mars and Jupiter)?

Phaeton was a planet hypothesized to have existed between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the destruction of which supposedly led to the formation of the asteroid belt.
Can we measure its orbital period based on what we know of the asteroid belt?
