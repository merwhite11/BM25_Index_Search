Can you see man-made lights on the dark side of the Earth from the surface of the moon with the naked eye?

This question is prompted from a comment on this answer:
Could a person on the surface of the moon see man-made lights on the dark side of the Earth with the naked eye? If not, how much magnification would be required to do see them?
The closest evidence I could find from a quick search was this picture from Salt Lake City Schools' Website:
The dark part of Earth is a bit hard to see here, though it can be seen more easily in the full resolution image. You can certainly see something toward the bottom edge in the dark area, but I can't tell for sure if it is lights from Southeast Asia/Oceania or something else.
Edit: As pointed out in the comments, the image of Earth in this photo wasn't actually taken from the moon, but from NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites and combined with the lunar imagery in a 2002 visualization created by NASA to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Apollo 17.
