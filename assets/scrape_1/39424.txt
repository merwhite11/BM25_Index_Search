I witnessed a steady stream of falling stars slowly falling one after another this morning. What was it?

This morning at 6:18am I witnessed a steady stream of falling stars that lasted at least 90 seconds from the time I noticed it. I live on a farm east of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and the stars were falling from the south to the east and fading as they neared the tree tops. They fell at 70 degrees east. Any idea what it is I witnessed?
