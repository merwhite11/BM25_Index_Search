Cosmology calculator where curvature density $\Omega_k$ can be independently set?

I am looking for a cosmology calculator that does not have the default that
$$\Omega_k = 1 - (\Omega_r + \Omega_m + \Omega_{\Lambda}).$$
I particularly want to run
$$\Omega_r = \Omega_m = \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0, \ \text{and} \ \Omega_k = -1.$$
Can this be done?
