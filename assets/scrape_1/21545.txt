Why do certain moons have their rotational period equal to their orbital period?

Our moon and Saturn's moon, Titan, have this feature.  Because of this we only observe one side (hemispere) of our moon. Why is this?  What is the Newtonian or astrophysics that would explain this?  It seems that it would be some kind of equilibrium that is arrived at over time, but I don't understand it.
