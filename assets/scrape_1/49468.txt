How bright would Betelgeuse's supernova appear?

Popular science articles suggest that when Betelgeuse goes supernova, for some days it would appear as bright as the full moon.  But I have no intuition about a celestial point source that bright.

Would staring at it for some time risk eye damage?
With the sun behind clouds and the supernova unobstructed, could it cast obvious shadows in daytime?
Would it affect weather forecasts' UV index (risk of sunburn)?
Might other analogies hint at what optical phenomena it might produce?
