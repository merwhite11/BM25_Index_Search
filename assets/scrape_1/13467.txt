Is there an objective difference between space expansion and reduction in speed of light

I just read an article about the cosmological model of an inflationary universe. As you probably know it basically states that space itself is subject to an expansion over time.
Since there is no moving matter or energy involved, this might even happen at a "speed" faster than light. So far, so good and obscure. What strikes me is the principle that the speed of light as a fundamental constant can only be expressed as a function of space-time. Where do we know that the one is constant but the other can suddenly be variable?
Is there any reason why the point of view of an expanding space is preferred over, say, a reduction in the speed of light or an increase in the "speed" of time? Is there any objective difference or is it just the good old rubber metaphor being stretched (pun intended) too far?
