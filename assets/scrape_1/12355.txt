Is this a wet moon?

Tonight around 12:20 AM I realized that the top part (instead of the side) of the moon was missing. I live at a country in the tropics.
I took this picture with my phone so it isn't very good.

After googling I found out about the wet moon phase in Wikipedia and I wonder if that is what I was looking at.
