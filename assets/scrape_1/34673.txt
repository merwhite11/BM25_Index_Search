INDI protocol with AZ GoTo SynScan to control an amateur telescope mount : problem with tracking

I have a SkyWatcher telescope with an AZ mount and a SynScan GoTo to drive the telescope.
I want to drive the telescope from my computer.
Using Linux, I use the INDI protocol (https://www.indilib.org)  with the Kstars/Ekos software.
The problem is that, when I ask the system to track a specific RA/DEC coordinates point, the telescope slews but then stops tracking.
I have the same problem using carte du ciel instead of Kstars.
Here are some system specifications

synscan version : 4.39.1 
indilib version : 1.8.3 
OS : Linux Debian 9

Has it happened to someone else?
