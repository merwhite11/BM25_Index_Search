Could 99942 Apophis break up due to Earth's gravity during 2029 flyby?

Asteroid 99942 Apophis is due to pass close to the Earth in 2029, at a distance of slightly less than 40,000 Kilometres. According to the description we have, the shape is irregular and elongated. It is probably formed by several objects loosely held together by a small gravity. So I wondered if those features make it so fragile that it might break up under the pull of Earth's gravity.
I searched the question on the internet and I found only an article that says that the Earth's gravity during the flyby could cause some landslides. But the authors say that the study didn't have very precise data, they had to take some assumptions.
Beside that article I did not find anything else. With a slight change of the assumption could the asteroid break up during the flyby?
