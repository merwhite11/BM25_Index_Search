What would a gas giant, such as Uranus, look like if it were orbiting a sun like star at an Earthlike orbit?

This is a hypothetical. If a gas giant with the approximate mass and density of Uranus existed within the goldilocks range to support life around a star, what would be the conditions on the service. Let's assume the same general composition as Uranus for a control. Would a gas giant still be mostly ice at this distance? And if there is a change in the state of the composition on the gas giant, how might this effect moons with water/liquid (i.e., would the tidal shifts be able to support like on land on a moon around such a planet?)
As a follow up, would different types of stars change this state, assuming stars ranging from Class A, F, G, or K?
