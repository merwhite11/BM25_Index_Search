Why isn't everything yellow(ish)?

I understand that - although appearing yellow - the sun is white. And that this is because the other light colours are scattered by the atmosphere. For example:
Google image search for "The Sun from Space"
That was difficult for me to come to terms with.
But if yellow light is what's getting through the atmosphere - why doesn't everything have a yellow tinge to it?
