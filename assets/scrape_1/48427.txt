I believe I saw a UFO, what else could it be?

When looking at the night sky some time ago I noticed a white dot. The amount of light coming from or being bounced on that object made it the same size of a average star. But differently from a star, it moved way too quickly, like it crossed the sky in less than 2 seconds. I eliminated the possibility of satellites or space stations since that speed wouldn't be possible, and to top all that, it's movement wasn't straight or linear, it was randomly crossing the sky, stopping for a few seconds then continuing it's fast pace and crossing the sky in seconds. Is there something that might explain what I saw? It literally felt like someone was playing with a white colored laser dot on the night sky, that's how weird and fast it was
