Do extraterrestrial landscapes or planets count as nature?

If I am talking about the surface of Mars, is this still nature, comparable to uninhabited places on earth, or does nature exclusively describe not man-made things on earth. 
I am asking this question in Astronomy, because I would like to know what astronomers or other people dealing with extraterrestrial science on a regular basis think about it.
