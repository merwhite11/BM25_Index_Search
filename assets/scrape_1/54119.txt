What is the most common method that a scientist uses to study the cyclones in the universe?

Cyclones have been observed throughout the universe as seen in the following examples:

Jupiter's Great Red Spot is perhaps the most well-known cyclone in our solar system. It is a giant storm that has been raging on Jupiter's surface for at least 350 years, and it is much larger than any storm on Earth. The storm is thought to be fueled by the planet's internal heat, and it rotates counterclockwise.
Saturn also has a hexagonal-shaped cyclone at its north pole, which is much larger than any storm on Earth. The storm has been observed by spacecraft since the 1980s and is thought to be caused by the planet's unique atmospheric conditions.
Neptune has a series of dark spots on its surface that are thought to be cyclones, and they are often seen to be interacting with each other. Uranus also has storms on its surface, although they are less well-studied.
Cyclones have also been observed on the moons of Jupiter, particularly on Io, which has hundreds of active volcanoes that can create plumes of gas that form rotating storms.
Exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system, have also been observed with cyclones. In 2018, astronomers discovered a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b that has a glowing, red-hot atmosphere and a cyclone the size of the state of Texas.
