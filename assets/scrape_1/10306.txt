BIG CRUNCH Theory

Someday before i read about a article which explained about a phenomenon called BIG CRUNCH, according to it the way Big Bang happened because of which the remains moved away from one another forming universe planets and all other celestial bodies. In the same way some day the gravitational pull caused by each of these celestial bodies will drag each other celestial bodies towards it ending the universe by making it one, is this true can this happen?
