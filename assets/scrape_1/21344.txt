How can I calculate the time between sunset and actual darkness?

I would like to know the time it takes to go from sunset to dark based on GPS location.
In addition, ideally I would also like to have a formula that determines the percentage of sunlight at each minute past sunset. For example, after 15 minutes, there is only 50% sunlight left.
