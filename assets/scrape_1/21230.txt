Introduction to the Magellanic Clouds?

I'm looking for an introductory textbook on the Magellanic Clouds, something suited for a student about to obtain their Physics BS degree (ie: not a professional astronomer).
I'm aware of The Magellanic Clouds, Westerlund (1997), but that book is:
A) Not introductory
B) 20 years old
Are there any newer and ideally more beginner friendly textbooks out there?
