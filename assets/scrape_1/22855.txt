Milky Way, view outward or inward?

I have a question about the view of the Milky Way that we can see from earth with the naked eye.  I believe this to be light from the stars contained in one of the "arms" of the galaxy.  I had always assumed that, from our vantage point, I was looking outward through one of the arms.  This was based on the appearance of the apparent curvature over the sky above.
However, it occurred to me that this could also be looking in towards the center of the galaxy.  And the fact that it appears to curve around us over the night sky is just an illusion.
Or, perhaps at different times in the year we are alternatively looking inward and then later looking outward.
Can any shed some, errr, light on this?
