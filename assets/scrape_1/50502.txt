Has NASA released any JWST images of Trappist-1? If not, why?

According to JWST weekly schedules (found here), the Trappist-1 system was among the telescope's targets during early July.
The only JWST image of an exoplanet in the Trappist-1 system that I've managed to find was posted by a redditor (as explained by an article here). This is a processed image and the poster failed to provide a link to the original data.
So is there any JWST image released by NASA of the Trappist-1 system or any of its planets? If not, why is it taking NASA too long?
