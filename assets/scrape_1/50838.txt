Which are some little known catalogues whose objects can be observed during the night sky?

We all know about the Messier catalogue. Little know or have heard about the Melotte catalogue. I am in search of those rare catalogues apart from Messier, NGC and IC with objects/sources that aren't mentioned in either of the aforementioned catalogues.
