Image processing techniques to distinguish between stars and galaxies in an image?

Say I have an arbitary image of stars and galaxies without any extra information (no other spectra info other than image itself). Can you help me distinguish them? 
Are there any specific features / properties I could look for? Say for eg the R G or B value or maybe values in some other color space (YUV etc.) be more or less for stars than galaxies, etc.
EDIT:
I dont have any "special" data (no sensor or spectral data), I only have data from the internet (common images). The point is to detect stars and galaxies from images commonly found on the internet.
