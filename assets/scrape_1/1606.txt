traveling past the speed of light

According to the theory of relativity (If I understand correctly), nothing is supposed to be able to travel faster then the speed of light. I believe, to my limited knowledge and grasp of the concept, that quantum theorie speaks against, i.e. extend, the theory of relativity, hence my question:
Suppose we find (or imagine) a place in the universe where there is no obstruction for this thought experiment to take place. We take a spherical object and attach a spire at both sides so you get an object shaped like this: -O-
We start turning the object so the ends of the spire travel in an orbital mather according to the spherical object. What if the sphere starts to orbit near the spead of light, wouldn't the ends of the spires travel faster than the speed of light?
Sorry if this is the wrong place for this question.
