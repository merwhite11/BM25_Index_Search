Wondering about a horseshoe orbit

Since I'm not a physicist, I want to know how that system works. 
For instance, if there was a planet, very similar to the Earth, but with two moons, and the moons where in a horseshoe orbit, how does it work? Is it stable?
I need it explained in an easy way, and also how would the moons look like from the Earth?
Thanks!
