What is the magnitude of variation of Earth's orbital inclination?

Please excuse if this has been asked and I just didn't find it.
I have found several references that indicate that the inclination of Earth's orbit varies over a period of ~70,000 years, but I can't seem to find anything that tells what the range of variation is. I know that it's currently at 1.57Â° to the invariable plane, but I'm looking for the value of the maximum tilt.
Thanks in advance!
