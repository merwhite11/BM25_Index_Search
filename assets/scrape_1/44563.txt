If the sun would be two times as big and with the same power output would temperature on Earth change?

Suppose the suns radius is increased by two. And suppose its emitted power doesn't change. Will we notice this on Earth? It will seem twice as big but apart from that what will we notice(if anything). Will it have a different color? Will temperature on Earth rise or drop? The energy arriving on Earth per second will still be the same. Maybe it's arriving in a different form though. I know it's a hypothetical question but one day the radius of the sun will increase. Maybe the power emitted will not stay the same but imagine it did.
If the emitted power is the same does it matter if the emitting body is a large spere of gas or a solid sphere?
