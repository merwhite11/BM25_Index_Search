Special Relativity as Applied to an Interstellar Starship?

I'm once again confused by the twin paradox. Let's say I am on an interstellar starship flying at 0.6c from a star 30 light years away from Earth to a star 50 light years away from Earth and 40 light years from each other. How would you estimate the difference between the time on the ship when you reach the destination versus the time a person on Earth thinks it should be? Now let's say I travel back to the original star (In both circumstances, I accelerate at 1g until reaching 0.6c.) I would assume that I could use the twin paradox formula to determine the difference in elapsed time on the ship from that measured by a clock left at the first star.
Now, let's say I'm traveling in the same manner (1g acceleration until reaching 0.6c and 1g deceleration for the same duration until arrival) beginning at Earth, traveling to 16 stars and returning to Earth. I am thinking that the time difference between the ship clock (date) and Earth time would be based on the distance and acceleration/ deceleration segments of each leg of the journey independent of the components of the travel vectors in the direction (toward or away from the Earth). Am I right??
Would Earth send messages to the ship based on conventional measurements (ie Physics 101)? I would want to determine the difference between the time on Earth when the message is sent and the ship time when the message is received, considering of course the time of transit of the message (at light speed).
