The battle over Gliese 581 and Gliese 667C?

In 2014, Robertson et al. made a case that stellar activity is masquerading as planets (here and here) for these well-known systems. In both cases, they claim that the only real planets discovered so far are planets "b" and "c". In 2015, Anglada-Escude et al. questioned the methods of Robertson et al. (here). Also in 2015, Brewer et al. suggested that there is evidence for multiple planets at Gliese 581 here (note, I only have access to the abstract - fulltext is here). Is there a direction that a majority of the professional community is leaning?
