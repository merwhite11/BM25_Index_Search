Seeing comet NEOWISE?

Today the NY Times published an article that explained how to see NEOWISE at night.
The article explains it like this:

To catch NEOWISE yourself, look up at the northwest skies about an hour and a half after sunset. Experts suggest going to the darkest area you can for best viewing. Find the Big Dipper and follow its ladle as it arcs in the direction of the horizon.


NEOWISE will appear under the Big Dipper about 10 degrees above the horizon and be about as bright as that constellationâ€™s stars. If you hold out your arm, 10 degrees is roughly the part of the sky covered by your fist. Over the next few days, NEOWISE will move higher in the sky and be easier to spot, reaching its apex on July 23, when it makes its closest approach to Earth.

It says that I'll be able to see the comet "under the Big Dipper about 10 degrees above the horizon".
What "horizon" is the article referring to? It says above the horizon and under the Big Dipper. Is the Big Dipper just above where the sun disappears and the comet will be seen in that area?
