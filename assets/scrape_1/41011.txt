What's the safe distance from a hypernova?

Hypernovae are even rarer than supernovae, occuring in stars at more than 30 solar masses, destroying the star that goes hypernova. This post states a hypernova releases several million times more light than all of the Milky Wayâ€™s stars put together.
A safe distance from a supernova from Earth is considered 50-100 light years. How far would a hypernova have to be from Earth to not cause significant damage to the Ozone layer, and how far to not destroy all life on Earth?
