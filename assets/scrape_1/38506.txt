Surface of the Sun, or Jupiter, etc

I keep hearing and reading statements that refer to the "surface of the Sun" (how hot the surface of the sun is) or the "surface of Jupiter" (when the Shoemaker comets hit Jupiter). I find this to be very confusing and unscientific (especially when stated by astronomers).
If the Sun and Jupiter are basically balls of gas they don't have a surface. It is like saying that the surface of the Earth is somewhere in the upper atmosphere.
Can anyone help me understand how a ball of gas can have a surface.
