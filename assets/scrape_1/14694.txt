Stellar mass limits for Neutron Star and Black Holes

Don't hate on me if I am asking a very basic and straightforward thing. I have a few questions about black holes and neutron stars.

What is the mass range (in terms of solar masses) for a main sequence star to end its life as . . .

A) a neutron star?
B) a black hole?

Is it there a (practically observed or proven) possible method for a main sequence star to form a neutron star (or black hole) at the end of its life cycle without undergoing through the process of supernova?
If yes, please explain or guide me some article on this matter.
What is the mass range of a main sequence star to end up as a pair instability supernova?
If the range of pair instability supernova overlaps with that of neutron star or black hole forming supernovae, how do we determine what type of end a star would have?
