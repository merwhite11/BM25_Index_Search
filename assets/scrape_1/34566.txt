Would "layered" radio interferometry work?

tl;dr - Is splitting up the process of interferometry as shown in the diagram possible, and if so, is it more efficient and/or easier than traditional methods?
I have been doing some research into radio interferometry, and I had a question about it - I know that we can combine the signals from multiple telescopes into one "image" using interferometry, but what if I was able to do that multiple times?
Let me describe this a bit better. Say I have nine dishes. I arrange three of them in an equilateral triangle, and then I do the same with the other 6, and then, I arrange those three groups of three into a larger equilateral triangle. Then, I combine the signals from each three of the telescopes, and then I combine the three resulting signals. Here's a diagram that might help - the blue dishes are the "telescopes", and the red and green boxes are the "processors" or where the signals would be interfered.

In principle, would this work? And, in the context of radio astronomy, would it be easier to combine or interfere only three signals rather than nine?
