What does lowercase 'beta' mean in this graph of radio-emitting galaxies?



Correlation between the mass of the galaxies (X-axis) and the difference of their radio emissions at different radio frequencies (Y-axis). Each symbol represents an individual galaxy. The image of an example galaxy is from NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope TÂ means the time for light to travel from these galaxies to us.
