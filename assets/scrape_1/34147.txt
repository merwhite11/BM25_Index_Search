(1 point) For the following problem find the range in which the answer lies: on the day of summer solstice, on which geographic latitude is the sun culminating at the angle of +72° 50' north of the equator?
  
  
A. 0° − 15°

I have two answers: 41° and 6°, but only one is accepted. No solutions are provided for 2018 and it is an objective question.
