Why haven't we had an "asteroid attack" until now?

We know that there is a big and dense ring of asteroids between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars and also "Trojans" and "Greeks" in Jupiter's orbit too. We also know that

there are around 4595 known comets in solar system, as of April, 2021


Also, Earth got hit by around 6100 meteors large enough to reach the ground, that's around 17 meteors a day, which is a lot!
If any of them hit any asteroid so wouldn't it be a disaster! As no atmosphere is there to stop them and meteorites have high speed, high enough to break Jupiter's gravity, so there should be a chain reaction as one asteroid hitting other two and the two becomes four, growing exponentially. So a sudden impulse can cause this, then we should get a fleet of big rocks as high as Mt. Everest coming at high speed towards us? Is it so, or anything am I missing?
