Basic, learning examples of applications of CFD and MHD in astrophysics, and current research directions using these techniques?

I am an undergraduate in Physics, and I have an opportunity to work with a some of my seniors to learn Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).
I would like to choose my first individual project in order to learn about how these techniques are used in Astrophysics.

What are a few basic, illustrative examples of the use of CFD and/or MHD that I might look into and consider working on as my first project?
What are illustrative examples of how these techniques are currently used in astrophysics research so I can have a better idea how I might use these skills in the future, and if possible a reference where I can read futher?
