Could entropy be reversed eventually in the far future?

In the far future there will be most likely a point where a maximal state of entropy will be reached in the universe and after the last black hole evaporates there could be no more structures and no more work could be done.
According to the Poincar√© recurrence theorem for a closed universe there could be a reversal of entropy in long-term periods. However in a flat universe with an accelerated expansion it is not so clear that this theorem holds.
However, are there any other mechanisms through which entropy could be ever reversed eventually after reaching heat death? Perhaps something related with quantum fluctuations?
