One Universe or Multiverse?

I watched a program where four astrophysicists were debating this topic. I couldn't fully understand what they were saying but wanted to ask others' opinions on whether there is only one Universe or multiple universes. I believe that there are other universes as well but I can't go along with the theory that we exist in other universes as well because this is just too far-fetched. What do others have to say about this? Also they said that there was no "Big Bang" but instead it was a ball of light that expanded out to form the Universe.
