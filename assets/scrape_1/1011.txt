Is C/2012 S1 (aka ISON) the fastest comet on record to-date?

This source may be nebulous (no pun intended!) for some. It writes to say

Starting at around 95,000mph at the start of this month, Comet ISON will eventually reach an astonishing 845,000mph on November 28th when it catapults round the Sun at perihelion

I'm no astronomer; the only comets I even know the names of are 

Shoemaker Levy
Swift Tuttle
Wild
Halley Bopp

To the best of my knowledge (feel free to poke me in the rib if i'm wrong!) none of the above list achieved a 3-digit velocity at perihelion. In contrast, going by the figure quoted above, S1 is expected to achieve a mind-boggling 375 km/s!
