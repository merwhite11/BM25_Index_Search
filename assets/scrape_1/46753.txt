Advice for next steps with astrophotography

Over the last year, I have started to take up the hobby of astrophotography. At the moment I have been focused on planetary astrophotography. Up until now I have been using a Celestron 5SE telescope (125mm aperture, 1250mm focal length) and a Sony Alpha 6000 DSLR camera I borrowed from a friend. Using this setup I have had some decent success with imaging Jupiter and Saturn (see below).


I think I am ready to take my photography to the next level with higher quality images. I believe my images are as they are because of the limited aperture of my telescope (though I could be wrong). I was wondering if the community had any advice for me in regards to my next steps. Should I buy a bigger telescope like a 8" or 10" SCT/Dobsonian for more light gathering power and higher magnification or should I instead invest in a better camera like the Sony A7R III camera with its full-frame 40MP sensor. Or is there another thing that I have not yet considered as a next step?
