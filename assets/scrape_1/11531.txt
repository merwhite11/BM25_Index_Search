Why does the Southern hemisphere seem to be short of radio telescopes?

In northern hemisphere, we have GBT, Arecibo, Parkes, Jodrell and VLA, while
in southern hemisphere, only Australia has big radio telescopes.
ALMA is in Chile, but it is in sub-mm. 
Is not appropriate to put big radio telescopes on the plateaus of Chile?
