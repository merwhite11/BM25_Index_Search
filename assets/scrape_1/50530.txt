Satellites or UFOs?

Last night in Greenville MI at around 9:15pm-9:25pm (I don't know the exact time) I saw what appeared to be a satellite appear and disappear and then a few seconds later another possible satellite appear in the same spot and then disappear. And then a few seconds later another possible satellite appear in the same spot and then disappear.  This event happened for a few minutes. I am not sure what it was... What do you think?
