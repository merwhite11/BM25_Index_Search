Do stars made by universe getting smaller or larger in mass?

Do stars made by universe getting smaller or larger in mass compared to stars made 180 million years after the Big Bang? If they are getting smaller, is this due to the fact that the universe is expanding and the interstellar mass that made stars is getting less denser?
