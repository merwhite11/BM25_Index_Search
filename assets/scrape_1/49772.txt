Why do the Andromeda Galaxy images from NASA have some sort of color shifting in it

I was checking the images from this website of the Andromeda Galaxy.
However, I noticed that low res images look good, however, the 1.7Gb images has some sort of color shifting in it:
Is there any simple explanation for this? Or is it just normal and the compression to lower res removes it?
Update:
Here is the zoomed version on one of the red region (rotated)
