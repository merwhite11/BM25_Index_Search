.2015: When last did both New/Full moon in a fort-night cause an Eclipse?

Going through http://earthsky.org/â€¦/dates-of-next-lunar-and-solar-eclipses I made the (what was for me - momentous) discovery that
March 20, 2015 - New moon - is a Solar Eclipse, and that the succeeding
April 04, 2015 - Full moon - heralds a Lunar Eclipse.

Is it common that both New/Full moon in a fort-night cause an eclipse?
When was the last time an Eclipse occurred back-to-back on a consecutive New Moon/Full Moon?
