Can Hubble red shift be interpreted as time dilation?

Can we interpret the de Sitter universe as a spherical cosmic horizon null surface of finite radius, centered at Earth, and containing the Hubble volume of space where time is dilated and radial dimensions contract closer to the edge in such a way that objects closer to the edge do not recognize that they are radially contracted?
Everything is attracted to the edge, but the total radius remains more or less constant and emits de Sitter radiation at finite temperature.

P.S. I know real universe is not de Sitter but it is usually asserted that it approaches de Sitter state asymptotically.
