What online tools are available to investigate and classify solar eruptions?

I was just casually browsing when I came across a link about at recent solar flare. So I went to investigate at SpaceWeather. There it was stated:

Looking further down the page it seem to say that there is only a 5% chance for being an X-flare.

With other words, quite unlikely, while using a somewhat obtuse language of "if current trends continue...could be...".
So my question is:
(a) How are these flares tracked after they've been detected?
(b) What other detector mechanisms do we have (if any) along the way, to detect the progress of such CME's?
(Preferably before they arrive here.)

Possibly related questions:

how accurate are the predictions for coronal mass ejections-(location, timing and magnitude)?
What are the main differences between solar flares and coronal mass ejections?
