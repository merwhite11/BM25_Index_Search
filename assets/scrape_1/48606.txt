How did Hubble know the red shift difference between "moving away" and "old"?

My 9yo daughter is very into space at the moment and asked a question that my physics knowledge (6th form college, 20 years ago) is way too poor to answer.
Her space book tells us that as stars age, they get redder. On the next page, it tells us that Hubble knew the Universe was expanding because distant galaxies were red, and thus moving away.
She (and I!) would like to know (in layperson's language please ), how did Hubble know they were moving away and not just old?
