How often are there lunar eclipses on Jupiter

For the Earth-Moon system, the orbit of the Moon is at a slight incline compared to the plane of the ecliptic. This incline is enough for there to be eclipses roughly twice a year rather than every lunar month. 
But Jupiter is much bigger, so its shadow is bigger also. So it seems more likely for a satellite to go into its shadow. How often does this happen?
