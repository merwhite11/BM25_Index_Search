Why solar eclipse paths are symmetrical?

Reading upon the eclipse of March 20, 2015, I stumbled upon this page: http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list-solar.html. What caught my eye is that for each year there are two eclipses whose paths are almost symmetrical relative to equator.
I'm just curious why that's always exactly so.
