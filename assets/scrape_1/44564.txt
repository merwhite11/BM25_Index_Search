What are the most distant extended objects we can see (or that are seen up till now)?

Apart from stars and galaxies, what are the most distant extended objects that we have ever seen? For example, can gas clouds or nebulae be seen in other galaxies?
In the list referred to in the link only far away galaxies are mentioned. Images of the closest galaxy, Andromeda, show separate stars. Can nebulae be observed in it? Or other non-starry objects? Stars will obviously stay point-like. I'm asking if extended objects (much bigger than stars) can be seen, with the help of time exposed photographs maybe?
By an extended object I don't mean stars or groups of stars. These are easily seen. I mean things like nebulae or other large scale structures. Can these even be observed in other galaxies?
