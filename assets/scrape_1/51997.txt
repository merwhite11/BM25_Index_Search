Temperature of a gas giant 23 AU from Fomalhaut

If a gas giant, weighing about 30 Jupiter masses, orbited the A-type star Fomalhaut at 23 AU, what would its temperature be? Would it be warm enough to have ammonia clouds like Jupiter or Saturn, or would it be too cold to support these and instead “condense” into an ice giant?
