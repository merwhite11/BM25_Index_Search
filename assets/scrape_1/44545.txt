Setting of stars

In the book Thinking Physics by Lewis Caroll I came accross the following exercise:

Using a good digital watch, get the exact time when a bright star goes behind a distant building or tower. A day later time the disappearance again. Sighting over a nail fixed in a window sash will help you return your eye to the same location for each sighting. It will be found that

the star disappears at the same time each night
the star disappears a little earlier each night
the star disappears a little later each night


I am thinking that each Night stars come up 4 min earlier so the answer must be b. Could you help me with the reasoning, please?
