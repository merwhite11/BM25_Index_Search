The # of Estimated Galaxies increased 10 fold. Where does that leave our # of stars estimate?

I have found oddly different answers through my multiple google searches.
I found one article that mentioned this did not alter the estimated number of stars in the universe. Link: http://www.universetoday.com/30305/how-many-galaxies-in-the-universe/
Yet other article gave the estimate of stars an increase. Link: http://gizmodo.com/we-were-very-wrong-about-the-number-of-galaxies-in-the-1787750693
There were other examples but they also had similar contradictory answers.
Thank you.
