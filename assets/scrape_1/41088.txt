Recent research regarding if the local group of galaxies will remain bound to the Virgo Cluster?

The question of if the local group of galaxies will remain bound to the Virgo Cluster has been asked before (Is the local group bound to the Virgo cluster?). I am wondering if there is any more recent research regarding this? I haven't found anything more recent than the 2002 paper mentioned in the post I linked above: https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0204249
This is a subject that I know very little about, so I'm looking for advice on how to get more informed about it. There is a comment on the aformentioned post that says, "The confusing part is that there seems to be a gravitationally bound Virgo cluster, of which we are not part, and a gravitationally unbound Virgo supercluster, of which we are part." Does current research suggest that we are permanently bound, or only temporarily?
This more recent post (Time-frame regarding cosmic expansion and the bound state of the Virgo Cluster), for example, claims that we may be bound gravitationally to the Virgo Cluster enough to resist cosmic expansion and asks for a timeframe for which we are inexorably bound, but the answer seems insufficient to justify this assumption.
