Does all the exoplanets orbit the same direction?

In one stellar system like our milkyway, all the planets orbits in the same direction. But are exoplanets orbitting in the same direction as we (earth) do, or is there a higher percentage which orbit in one or the other way? If so what could be the reason for that?
