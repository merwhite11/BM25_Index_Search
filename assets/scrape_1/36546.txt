Bounded Observable Universe; is there an object we once could see but can no longer?

If the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light, then there will be objects (matter or energy or whatever) that previously could be seen, but no longer can be seen, precisely because the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light.
Is there such an object that we can no longer see, though previously we could see it?
