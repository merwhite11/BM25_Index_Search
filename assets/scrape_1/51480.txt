If an eclipse starts on one calendar date and ends on another, which date the eclipse will have occurred on for record keeping?

Let's assume a lunar eclipse starts at 2359 on 1 January and ends at 0004 on 2 January? In this scenario, which date will be considered for recording this eclipse? The date it started on or the date it finished on?
This scenario may never happen in real life but I am just curious to know what is the process of selecting a date to record the eclipse.
