could dark energy be a force coming from the hyperspace outside the universe?

It seems to me that the expansion of the universe is only being looked at one way. a repelling force, basically being the opposite of gravity.  After pondering this for many nights, I began to wonder if its possible that the changing pressure outside the universe could cause the expansion thst we observe.
