What is the relation between between hardness ratio(HR) and spectral state of a X-ray binary star system?

When reading about hardness ratio, it shows that depending on the hardness ratio spectral states of a binary star can be divided into soft, hard states. So how the HR value changes with respect to the spectral state?
And when telling about hard state and soft state, what do we mean by this statement.
