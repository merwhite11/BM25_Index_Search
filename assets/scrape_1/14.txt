Are astronomers researching or trying to find signs of worm holes?

In many movies and in the popular culture wormholes are often referenced, as well as "faster than light travel", which seems almost to be the same thing, is possible. 
Are astronomers seriously considering and researching this phenomenon? What could be the signature of wormholes? Would next generations telescopes as ELT able to detect such signatures?
