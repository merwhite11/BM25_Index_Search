How common is it for large objects (few kilometers wide) in a young protoplanetary disk or debris disk to collide with one another?

If enough time has passed for gravitational forces to allow the formation of planetesimals(proto-planets) in orbit around the proto-star, how likely is it that two of them would collide with one another? If they do collide, would a head-on collision be more likely than a glancing collision?
What would be the observable effect of such a phenomena?
