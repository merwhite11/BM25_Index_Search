Do all planets rotate in the same direction in relation to each other?

In other words, does everything spin counterclockwise according to their axes (in relation to each other)? I suppose my question goes for stars, moons and other objects too. 
But then again, all you have to do is look at any rotation upside down and it goes clockwise. So depending how you're looking at it, one could say everything rotates in the same direction whether they do or not. It's all a matter of perspective, right? And in space, there is no "right side up". Maybe my question is moot now that I think about it.
If we re-drew all of Earth's maps and globes upside down, New York or Sydney would be on the "west coast" and the Sun would rise in the "west" and set in the "east". Is it just by luck or maybe by the prominent early mapmakers, or that the majority of human population lives in the Northern Hemisphere, that it's given "dominance" on "top"? (I've heard that theory before)
Ugh. This is all so confusing.
