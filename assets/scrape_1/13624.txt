What conditions would lead to this event around the black hole in the Pictor A galaxy?


This is a picture of a jet of particles exiting the supermassive black hole in the center of Pictor A galaxy at nearly the speed of light. Source
This event is supposedly created from a black hole of 40 million solar masses. The full quote here:

The newly released picture shows the terrifying power of an actual
  supermassive black hole located in the galaxy Pictor A, some 500
  million light years distant.  This black hole is about 40 million
  times the mass of the Sun (thatâ€™s about 10 times larger than the black
  hole at the center of our own galaxy), and if it were to replace the
  Sun within our Solar System, its event horizon would swallow the
  orbits of both Mercury and Venus.

Now a quick search to Wikipedia would show a abundance of supermassive black holes many, many times larger than that supermassive black hole as well as a few that are around the same mass as that.
To my question: What set of special conditions that surround this particular supermassive black hole such that it is capable of creating this spectacular event?
Edit for clarity: By this I meant the jet and the hotspot.
