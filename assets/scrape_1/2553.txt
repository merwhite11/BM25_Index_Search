Was the progress of astronomy in the 1800s surprisingly slow, and if so why?

The 1800's was a century of fantastic scientific discoveries in chemistry, geology, biology, engineering and so on.  Is it correct to say that astronomy did not keep up with this development? And if so, why? If not, what might be some main reasons for me (and others) having this impression?
The late 1700's saw a couple of revolutions in astronomy such as the discovery of Uranus as the first non-antique planet and the measurement of solar system distances thanks to the transits of Venus. As I understand it, the next big leaps in astronomy came in the early 1900's with the HR-diagram and the "discovery" of galaxies and more. The view of the universe did not seem to change much between 1800 and 1900. Nowadays every decade has its revolution such as inflation, dark matter, dark energy, exoplanets.
Spectroscopy, optics, photography, Doppler effect, and electricity all developed greatly during the 1800's but don't seem to have brought any revolution to astronomy until later. Is relativity and quantum physics behind this new flourishing? Had the Newtonian physics reached its limit for potentially revolutionizing astronomy already about year 1800? Or was astronomy just out of fashion, maybe because of more profitable employment for the brightest brains in the age of industrialization?
