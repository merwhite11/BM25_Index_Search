About the formation of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs), what are "failed L∗ galaxies"?

Recent studies show that ultra diffuse galaxies or UDGs were formed by tidally disturbed dwarf galaxies and failed L∗ galaxies.
So I've been searching for the failed L∗ galaxies but can't find what it is.
Are failed L∗ galaxies just the word that indicating Milky way like galaxies??
