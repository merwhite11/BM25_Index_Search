what is the pressure in Neptune where the density reach 1g/cm^3?

from this graph, it looks like it should be around 20000km from the center. So it is about 0.8 radius.
However, I cannot imagine this is correct. The pressure is probably only a few bar at that height. And it is mainly hydrogen. How can the hydrogen at this pressure has density of 1g/cm^3? Even considering the low temperature it has there, it is still impossible.
Can anyone explain this to me?
