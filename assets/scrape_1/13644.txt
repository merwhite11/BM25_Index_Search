How do star densities work?

If we take a look at stars more massive than the Sun, their densities vary a lot. UY Scuti is an extremely low-density star that's only 8.5x more massive than the Sun, but is 1000-2000x its size. r136a1, on the other hand, is 256x more massive than the Sun, but is only 30x its size. Neither of them are main-sequence. 
The Sun has a lower mass than both of them, yet it's also smaller than both of them.
It doesn't seem like mass makes a big difference. Both reach hydrostatic equilibrium at completely different sizes. r136a1 has a much stronger gravitational pull than UY Scuti, but it should also have much more radiation pressure, right?
So how can we determine the density of a star? Is there a formula?
