Whats the farthest distance a spacecraft has been detected (except by radio)

As far as I understand it, one can not hide spacecraft, because the heat from the engine would be very visible.
Now I tried searching for the farthest distance an actual spacecraft has been detected besides its radio signals that are intentionally sent to us. Unfortunately I could not find any data on this.
