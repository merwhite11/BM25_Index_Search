local stellar mapping data

I've been playing around with Near Star Map, and I think I kind of want something more sophisticated, so for all stars within 100ly/30pc, is the following known?

velocity (it would be nice to have a vector field showing how fast in which direction stars are moving)
magnetic field intensity
estimated age
local ecliptic plane (and as much as that's meaningful for three-star systems with Poincare-befuddling orbital dynamics)
