How did the ancients know the constellation in which the sun is located?

The zodiac constellations lie along the plane of the ecliptic. In Spring equinox, sun lies in Pisces constellations. So Pisces is not visible during the day (because the sun light) and not visible in the night.
My question is: How did the ancients know the constellation in which the sun is located (as this constellation is not visible)?
