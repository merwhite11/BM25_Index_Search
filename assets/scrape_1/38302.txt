At what distance could a supernova damage the Earth's ozone layer?

As from my latter question it seems Betelgeuse might be much closer than the usually presumed 640 light years. It might be as close as ~440 ly. Suppose it is, would this have any dangerous effects on the Earth's ozone layer (damaging it dangerously) and on orbital spaceflight? How close would a star like Betelgeuse have to be to have dangerous effects on the ozone layer and above (and thus on humans and other life on Earth)?
