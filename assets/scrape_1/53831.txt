Does space expand?

I know this has been asked and here are the links of at least two. The first link below is what I thought was the standard description.
What does it mean for space to expand?
Now by accident while reading a  different discussion I noticed this question.
How do we know we're not getting bigger?
One of the answers points to a link by an article by J.A. Peakcock and the other an article by "New Scientist" quoting Steve Weinberg so I thought I would include the link:

Basically in a nutshell Weinberg I think is saying space in not expanding it is the Copernican Principle and the fact that the universe was smaller in the past. He calls this a "complication". I assume while other people might call  it space expanding which he says emphatically is wrong.
I always thought space and time were well sort of tied together. I wonder how  something ia getting bigger in the past but not expanding in space?
The Copernican Principle is easy to understand and obviously true but that space does not expand according to this article is confusing. Perhaps there is a mathematical reason for this?
