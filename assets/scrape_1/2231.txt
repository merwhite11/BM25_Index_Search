Why is iron responsible for causing a supernova?

Why is the element iron responsible for supernova? Can any star create more element than iron within the span of its life?
I understand that when star dies due to supernova, other elements are created (Gold and other 92 elements) due to more heat generated than required not only for fusion of Iron element but also for the fusion of higher element with each other.
