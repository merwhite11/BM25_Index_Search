Are there black holes and neutron stars in satellite dwarf galaxies orbiting around Milky Way?

It is thought that the number of satellite dwarf galaxies orbiting around Milky Way is counted in hundreds.
Are there black holes and neutron stars in satellite dwarf galaxies orbiting around Milky Way and what would be the methods of their detection? Could the probability of having binary massive dense objects (pair of black holes or pair of neutron stars or black hole + neutron star) in such satellite dwarf galaxies orbiting around Milky Way be estimated?
