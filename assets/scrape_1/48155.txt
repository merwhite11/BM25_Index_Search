What ground-based observational evidence is there that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere?

The Moon doesn't have any significant atmosphere (surface pressure is $3\times10^{-15}$ bar). Can the absence of atmosphere on the Moon be determined with ground-based observations? When was it first determined that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere, and with what data?
