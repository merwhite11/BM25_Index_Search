How do we know the Moon was much closer than it is now?

We know that right now, by measurement, the Moon is moving further away from the Earth.  So I've heard the conclusion that the Moon was much closer to the earth in the past.
How do we know that part?  Is there empirical evidence of that or is it an assumption based on the fact the moon is moving away right now, so it's a simple extrapolation backwards in time?
Could it possibly be the Moon distance oscillates? Moving further away until a maximum and then moving towards the Earth until a minimum?
