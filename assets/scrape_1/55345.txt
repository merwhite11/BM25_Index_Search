Vision at night

I'm wondering if it's possible to be able to assess the level of light available to the human eye provided by the night sky and celestial objects. I'm interested in the night of 15th June 2019 at Rosses Point, County Sligo Ireland, co-ordinates 54°18′33″N 8°33′58″W. I would also like to understand how the position of the moon and its distance/angle from Earth at any time of the year could have an impact on night light.
