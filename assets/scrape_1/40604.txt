If we stood on the surface of a Jovian moon, Saturn would appear as a dot. Why doesn't Saturn appear like this in a telescope?

Images from the conjunction like these show Saturn just a bit smaller than Jupiter. However, if you were in the vicinity of Jupiter, Saturn would still appear as a dot to the naked eye, wouldn't it? If so, why is Saturn recognizable as a planet through a telescope in which Jupiter is also seen as a planet? As if they were actually very close to each other, at about the same distance from the Sun. I mean, if you recognize Jupiter in a telescope, shouldn't Saturn behind it look like a dot, unless you have a much, much larger zoom in which Jupiter would appear too close to match into the whole image while being too unsharp anyway?
