Why are the largest stars, such as O-type or B-type, most likely to be in multi-star systems; while red dwarfs are least likely?

I was just reading about what percentage of stars in our galaxy and, perhaps, other galaxies are in binary systems (or trinary... etc.).
Researchers keep going back and forth about whether or not most stars are in multiple-star systems are not....
But what recently caught my attention was a statement, repeated elsewhere, that 80% to 85% or so of the largest stars are in multi-star systems, while only maybe 25% (at best) of red dwarfs, the smallest true stars, are companions....
Why would this be?
The only reason I can think of is that large stars are in such gas-and-dust crowded areas that the same surplus of material that creates the gigantic stars in the first place also creates companions, while red dwarfs are in lonelier places....
Is that true?  Are red dwarfs usually found on the outskirts of galaxies?
