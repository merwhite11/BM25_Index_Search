Why does the Milky Way look as though it's lit from one side?

I was reading a good explanation of why we don't see the colors in the Milky Way with the naked eye, while even undoctored photos show some color.  (It has to do with our colorblind rods.)
But it got me to wondering: Why, in even black-and-white photos, does the galaxy appear brighter on one side, as though there were a bright light shining on it from galactic south (or north, I don't know which is which)?  Does the "shadowed" side have more dust?  Is it an artifact of the photographic process?  An optical illusion?
[Edit: Added the panorama.  I suppose the effect is more pronounced towards galactic center.  But it still seems like a non-random distribution.  Of dust, if that's what it is.]
