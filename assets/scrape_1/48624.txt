Does the magnetosphere of Jupiter protect the Galilean Moons from solar flares?

Teasing out a sci-fi story and would like to get things right science-wise. Sun's about to flare (yes, I know we're not great at predicting that yet but near future) and Earth's doomed. Would the increased distance from the Sun and Jupiter's magnetosphere protect the Galilean moons?
