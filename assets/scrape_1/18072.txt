How is the time of sunrise and sunset determined?

If I do a quick Google search for amsterdam sunrise, I immediately get the time back: 6:42 AM.
How is this time calculated?
(I mean how it is really calculated, not how Google get it, with is probably from a table. Of course I mean sunrises and sunsets in the future, not from the past. $:)$)
