The most precise way to point the true north

Since all of my telescopes have equatorial mount and It needs to be placed with respect to North direction, what is the best way to point the North.
Expecting answers that doesn't suggests methods involving the polaris (since trees in my area hide it entirely) and regular compass (I don't feel it is very precise)
