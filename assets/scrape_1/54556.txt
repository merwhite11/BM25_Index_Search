How common are there planets with significant share of oxygen in atmosphere?

Has been there detected any exoplanets with significant share of oxygen in atmosphere? What does the theory predict?
Superficially this looks like it should be fairly common: there is a lot of water in the universe and hydrogen can easily escape most medium-sized bodies leaving oxygen behind.
