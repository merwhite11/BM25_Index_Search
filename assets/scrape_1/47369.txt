Is there any conferences/symposiums/workshops/schools aggregator service?

I'm looking for a conference/etc.. for next year and I've found that this information is very much scattered about. One almost has to know beforehand the existence of a given conference/etc.. because otherwise it is almost impossible to find it.
Is there a service that aggregates this type of information?
