Is the Big Bang a theory or a model?

I ask this because someone mentioned ‘it isn't a theory, it's a model’ in the comments in an old question of mine: Is the expansion of the universe proof of the big bang?
I guess defining terms is important. If there are different opinions about this, then it would be great if you state that in your answer.
Is the Big Bang a theory, a model, or perhaps both or neither?
