Benefits to adding a 32mm Pössl to my Celestron AstroMaster 130EQ's eyepieces?

I am getting a Celestron AstroMaster 130EQ soon. I have heard that its eyepieces aren't the best, so I am considering a 32mm Pössl.
For such a choice, what would be the arguments for and against? How would my viewing experience improve, and for what objects would this be most and least obvious?
