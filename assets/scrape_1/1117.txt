Is there any telescope on Earth that can see the lunar rovers on the Moon?

If I have the right numbers, it seems to me that even the Hubble telescope might barely be able to make out a carcass of a blue whale on the surface of the Moon, which puts objects as small as the lunar rovers or the American flag left there during the Apollo lunar landings out of range.
The Hubble is often lauded as the best telescope we have built, partly because it is in space, where it's free from all of the interference of the atmosphere, but is there any ground-based observatory with better resolution? Is there any place on Earth where I could point a scope at the Sea of Tranquility and see what we left there over 40 years ago?
