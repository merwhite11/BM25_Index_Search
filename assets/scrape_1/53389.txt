What percentage of galaxies are isolated galaxies and what percentage are members of a cluster?

Some galaxies, such as NGC821 are classified as "isolated galaxies", others form  parts of distinct groups or clusters (relevant link) Although isolated galaxies may be accompanied by small satellites, they are distinct from the three large galaxies in the M66 group or the many galaxies in the Coma cluster. Those galaxies are part of an obvious grouping.
Among large galaxies (and ignoring the many dwarf galaxies) what proportion are isolated, like NGC821, and what proportion are found in groups or clusters?
