Time according to the gravity of Sagittarius A*?

This may be a really dumb question (I'm more of a Biologist than an Astronomer) so I apologize in advance for my little knowledge pertaining to Astronomy, but, if I'm not mistaken, time is effected by gravity, right? So what is Sagittarius A*'s time compared to ours since it has so much stronger gravity? Do we know specifically the difference?
