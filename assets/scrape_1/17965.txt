Is the universe moving through infinite space time as it expands?

What I mean by this, is imagine a person blowing up a balloon. As the balloon expands, the person blowing it up is also walking. At a much grander scale, apply this concept to the universe. As the universe expands, is it also moving like the balloon through infinite space time?
