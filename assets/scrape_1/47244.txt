Is saying that what we see of an object 1 light-year away happened 1 year "ago" in any a way useful view of the universe?

Since the speed of light is the speed of causality, the "now" state of the a faraway object for an observer should be the exact point at which its light reaches the observer, for literally all intents and purposes.
My question is whether purporting that something "happened a long time ago but its light is only just reaching us" and that there is a more up-to-date state of an object is a scientifically useful viewpoint, or if it serves no other purpose than to deliver that pang of weird existential nostalgia for the layperson when we say "an alien on planet XYZ would look at earth and see dinosaurs roaming around"?
