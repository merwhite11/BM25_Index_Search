If our galaxy is mostly empty space then why does it look so solid?

This question has probably been asked quite a few times, but I'm having trouble finding anything due to the fact that this question is very specific in nature. So I'm asking again.
We know that outer space is mostly empty and stars are very far apart from each other. So much so that when two galaxies collide, the stars within them will just fly past each other instead of crashing. But when I look at pictures of the Milky Way, (some of them are real pictures of the center of the Milky Way taken from earth, while others are renderings) it looks so bright and so solid, like theres so much stuff in there. It becomes hard to believe how it can be that it's mostly empty.
Can anyone please explain what's going in there?
Thanks.
