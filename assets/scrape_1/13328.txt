Epsilon Eridani and Sadira

I have seen a number of places on the Internet where Epsilon Eridani is referred to as Sadira. (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Eridanus )   However, it would seem that its an unofficial name and the star got renamed Ran by the IAU in a competition.  

How did Epsilon Eridani become known as Sadira by some?
What or who was Sadira?
