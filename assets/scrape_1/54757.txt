How long has it been since dark energy started to reverse our slowdown and accelerate the expansion of the universe? 4 billion years ago? 4.5? 5?

Or has it been as long as six billion years?  Over the last few years I keep seeing longer and longer numbers...
Have researchers noticed something different recently?  Or found a mistake in their previous calculation(s) or theory?
Or has it been six billion years since a noticeable increase in the rate of deceleration due to (we think) dark energy, and four billion years since a change from deceleration to actual acceleration?
