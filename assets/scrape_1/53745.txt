Can a star with a stellar mass of 1.176 with a similar composition to the Sun have a planet with these characteristics?

Imagine a solar system similar to ours that has a star with a similar composition to the Sun and a stellar mass of 1.176 and an Earthlike planet with about 1.18 times the mass of Earth in its habitable zone. Could this planet have a day length of 26 Earth hours, an axial tilt of 0.2 degrees, and a higher eccentricity that will cause planetwide seasons that do not distinguish by hemisphere? If so, what orbital eccentricity is needed to produce this effect?
