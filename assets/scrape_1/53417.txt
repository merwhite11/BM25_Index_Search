Solar-winds: public NOAA data

I was searching for interesting data from space recently, and stumbled onto https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/.
The long and short is that they offer some interesting solar wind data
Of particular interest to me is the 'mag' data they offer here, and the 'plasma' data they offer here
I have some questions on these:

What is the 'mag'/'plasma' data exactly?
How come they are recorded and served to the public in such fast intervals in comparison to other data in the space industry?
What technology is used to record these data?
