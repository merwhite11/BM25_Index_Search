Is there any official star gazing location list?

I recall when I was a child (many years ago) my father taking us out to gaze at the starts. I remember being able to see the Milky Way with our naked eyes (North Central New Jersey). Nowadays living down here in Maryland I can count the stars on my hand because of all of the light pollution.
So I ask, is there some sort of listing that shows where the best places are to gaze without a telescope up at the stars?
I'd like to see the Milky Way again and not the white glow of the city lights.
