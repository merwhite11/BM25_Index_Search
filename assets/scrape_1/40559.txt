Why do astrologers use the “wrong” sign?

I realize this may be the wrong site for this question... I apologize if you consider it inappropriate but hope this community knows the answer.
We just experienced the spectacular conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn (yay!). When I look at the sky, I see these two planets on the edge of Capricorn, almost in Sagittarius. Yet astrologers claim the conjunction is “in Aquarius”.

What is different about their (astrology’s) coordinate system? Any (historical) perspective would be appreciated!
PS I have no interest in astrology as a tool for predicting the future - just trying to understand where this discrepancy comes from.
