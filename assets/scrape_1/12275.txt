Strength of gravity during the big bang?

I was watching a documentary on the big bang, one of the astronomers said that initially the four fundamental forces were combined as one, they then emerged to become: The strong and weak nuclear forces, the electromagnetic force and the gravitational force. He claimed that the first force to emerge was the gravitational force, he went on to say that had the gravitational force been weaker than it is everything would fly apart so no galaxies would form and if gravity was too large than we would end up with black holes everywhere, so the force of gravity needed to be just right, as it is now. I couldn't find anything backing up this information online or the reasoning behind this information, any help would be appreciated.
