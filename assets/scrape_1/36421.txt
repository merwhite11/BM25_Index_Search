What is the composition of the Universe in terms of Types Of Stars?

There are 

Main Sequence Stars
Red Giants
White Dwarfs
Red Dwarfs
Neutron Stars
and other types of Stars.

How many % of stars are Main Sequence? How many are Red Giants? and so on.
I searched around and found some info, but it's confusing me. For example, 
I found that 90% stars are Main Sequence Stars, but at the same time, Red Dwarfs are the most common stars in the universe with 70%. What is true?
