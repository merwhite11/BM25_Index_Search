Sideways crescent moon in Maryland

I am in Maryland, and the crescent moon has been horizontal (cereal bowl bottom pointed toward the earth) for at least the past month or two. Now it’s kind of diagonal. I’ve read that this is only seen close to the equator during certain times of the year. Why would I be able to see this far north of the equator?
