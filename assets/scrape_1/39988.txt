Why doesn't the night sky keep on getting brighter and brighter every day?

I think this should happen because of the below logic.

Consider Day 0 of planet earth. There is no light coming from any surrounding star that has reached our planet and hence its pitch dark.
On Day 1, the light of 1 star reaches us. And once it reaches us it will keep on coming continuously as it's not a pulse, it's just a continuous stream. Let us think that it's a 'string' or 'thread' say which starts from that star and reaches our planet and so we now have this connection.
On Day 2, light from another star reaches us. Again there is 1 more 'thread' which has now connected that star with our planet.
On subsequent days (and in between) more and more such threads get connected with our planet. And unless earlier stars that made this connection with our planet dies, the connections will only grow in number.
And so I would think that the night sky should become brighter and brighter every day.

Why doesn't this happen?
