Where to find data on orbits of exoplanetary systems?

I hope this is the correct place to ask this question which entails asking if there is a database much like the JPL NASA one for the solar system, but for exoplanetary systems? I am conducting an n body simulation as in the assignment it states "Study the stability of known exoplanetary data. You will need to look up the available planetary data." But from what I have seen there is no such data easily accessible. For my simulation, I input the mass, initial position and initial position. Is there a website or database that could help, I have seen data on these systems such as mass and the radius of the orbit, but that would be estimating the initial velocity and starting positions which I didn't deem the most scientific. Any thoughts or ideas are much appreciated.
