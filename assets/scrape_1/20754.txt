Approximating density of hydrogen in [observable] universe

Let universe be completely made from hydrogen. And also we have redshift $z= 6$. with Hubble constant $H_{0} = 2.1941747572815535\times 10^{-18}\:\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We also know that density of the universe $\rho =\frac{3H^2}{8\pi G}$ ($G= 6.67\times 10^{-11}\:\mathrm{m^3\ kg^{-1}\ s^{-2}}$).
Is the following approach right to find the number density of hydrogen in universe?
First we calculate density $\rho =\frac{3H^2}{8\pi G}$, then we have
$1+z = \sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}$. From that we get $v = H\times R$ and from this we calculate $R$, the radius of observable universe. With that, we calculate volume of universe $V = (4\pi/3)R^3$ and we get Mass $M=\rho V$. Then we calculate number of Hydrogen atoms with $N = M/m_{\mathrm{hydrogen}}$. Now we have number density of hydrogen $\rho = N/V$.
Is this solution right? Or we must solve it another way?
