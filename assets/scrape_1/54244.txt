How do primordial black holes are able to have an event horizon?

How do primordial black holes have an event horizon?
Sorry for the stupid question, but I know primordial black holes have just a handful of mass in a cosmic scale compressed in a singularity. But if the mass is so small, compared sometimes with the Moon, how do they can have a gravity that event the light can’t scape at a point?
At the beginning, I thought it was because of the density, but if it was the case, if the Sun was replaced by a black hole with the same mass, the planets orbits would be destabilized, wouldn’t be? But this is not the case: if we replace the sun with a black hole, everything would continue to be stable. That means the problem isn’t the density as I thought, and the primordial black holes would have to have the same gravity as moon. So please, what is happening?
