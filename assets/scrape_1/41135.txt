Is the list of the most abundant elements in the universe a fact?

I've heard  Neil deGrasse Tyson giving a short list of the most common elements in the universe on a video, which went on something like:

hydrogen
helium
oxygen
carbon
nitrogen
etc

As I understand astronomers use spectroscopy to determine an object's chemical composition.
My question is how can they determine the most common elements for certain, when most of what we see is a just a fraction of the stars, nebulas and an even smaller fraction of planets out there?
