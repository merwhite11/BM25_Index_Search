Are there any Stars we know don't have planets?

We have been looking for planets around other stars for a while (see related https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/1484 ) and we are finding lots of planets, some of them are Earth like According to an the answer at https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/4062 there are over 14,000 stars within 100 light years of Earth, the answer goes on to say there are "1,500 potentially habitable planets within 100 light-years" of Earth
Based on current trends it looks like there are lots of stars with lots of planets.  I am beginning to assume that our solar system is not unique and that  every star has several planets.
Are there any Stars that we know are without any planets?
