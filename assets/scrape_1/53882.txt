When dark energy became significant 6 billion years after the Big Bang was there anything else of significance going on in the universe?

I read that a lot of supernovas appeared at this time but were other major events or phenomenon occurring? I ask this in case there could be some physical process helping dark energy to strengthen or perhaps being helped by dark energy 6 billion years after the Big Bang
