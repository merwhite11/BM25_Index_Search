When do Mercury/Venus reach greatest elevation at sunset/twilight for a given location?

On what day does Mercury reach its greatest elevation (in degrees from 
the horizon) at sunset a given location? 
The obvious answer is the day of Mercury's greatest elongation from 
the Sun, but, since the ecliptic is slanted with respect to the 
horizon, I'm not convinced this is correct. 
In other words, on the day after greatest elongation, Mercury's total 
angular distance from the Sun will be smaller, but it's vertical 
distance in elevation (for a given location) at sunset might be 
higher. 
Same question for Venus, and for when the sun is 6 degrees below the 
horizon (ie, civil twilight), and for sunrise/dawn. 
I'm guessing the date might vary based on position (mostly latitude) since the ecliptic's slant varies at different locations.
I googled and found nothing. My (preliminary and possibly wrong) 
expierments with stellarium show that Mercury's elevation at sunset IS 
higher 1-3 days after its greatest elongation, but by less than 1/2 
degree.
So, it's possible that the date of greatest elongation is a close 
enough approximation.
