How good is the HST compared to ground telescopes?

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a remarkable device. It produced (produces) images whose resolution and clarity were a step change ahead of anything that could be captured from the ground. Is this still the case, or have adaptive optics and ever larger mirrors caught up with the image quality the HST can achieve? Is it still true that the HST's images are better than anything produced on Earth?
