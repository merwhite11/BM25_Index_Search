For colonization purposes, what is so good about Titan?

I have read that Titan is the best candidate for humans to colonize in our Solar System.
However it has no water, it's atmosphere is not breathable and it is -290Â° F on the surface. It doesn't sound too hospitable to me. Have they forgotten that humans can't live without water?
If this is the best candidate then I think that humans are doomed. So why is Titan the best option for humans to colonize?
