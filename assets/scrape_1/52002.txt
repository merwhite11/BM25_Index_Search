Why is the latest Webb discovery of early-age universe considered so important?

The past week, news were flooding of an unexpected discovery of James Webb Space Telescope. In many articles it is mentioned that cosmologists cannot explain the formation of galaxies of this magnitude on that stage of development of the universe.
My question is this:
What kind of evidence did cosmologists have to support a theory that an earlier, more densely packed with matter universe, where galactic collisions and mergers were more frequent, would wield smaller galaxies ?
