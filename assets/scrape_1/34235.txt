What are the benefits of a large refracting telescope?

Currently, refractor telescopes are limited in aperture because gravity will deform the main lens over time. According to Wikipedia the largest practical refracting telescope is 1m. 
If we were to overcome this limitation, what would be the theoretical benefit of such a telescope that other types of telescopes currently can't give us?
