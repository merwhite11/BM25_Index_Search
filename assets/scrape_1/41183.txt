Is it possible to see Jupiter, Saturn, Mars and Venus with the Spectra Optics Telescope 600x50? And even the moon?
This is the description of the telescope:

User-friendly and easy to install with magnification up to 100x.
A telescope is a learning and discovery tool that is suitable for both old and young. This model is larger and has significantly better optics than the telescope that Galileo Galilei used during his astronomical discoveries hundreds of years ago. Magnifies from 30-100x. The viewfinder binoculars (5x24 mm) make it easy to roughly calibrate the telescope and the stand is easy to mount. Focal length 600 mm. Light opening 50 mm. Weight about 3.1 kg. Live incl. 2 eyepieces.**
