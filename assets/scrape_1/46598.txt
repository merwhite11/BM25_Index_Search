If Proxima Centauri was replace with a quasi-star, would our telescopes be able to see it in fine detail?

Quasi-stars, if they ever existed, were stupid big and stupid bright; many times bigger, brighter, and more massive than any star supported by fusion can be. There's no question that it could be seen with the naked eye, but could our telescopes get detailed images of its surface?
As a side note, what effects would relpacing Proxima Centauri with a quasi-star have on our solar system, if any? Would it be like a second sun?
