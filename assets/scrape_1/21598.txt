Wouldn't be "dark matter" better called "massless gravity"?

In spite of being a simple words game, that would make me feel less uncomfortable, as there could be a mysterious field still less mysterious than matter that passes through itself etc. Moreover, couldn't be that there exist some high order terms that play a role only when mass reach big values, i. e. those comparable to a galactic mass? How/why this cannot be the case in general relativity?
