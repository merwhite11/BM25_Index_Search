Could Venus or Mercury have a moon that we haven't detected?

Let's consider Mars' two moons for a moment. They're small, not even spherical, and most likely are captured asteroids. They weren't discovered until the late 1800's. Telescopes are much more powerful today, so you'd think we'd have found any similar moons at Venus or Mercury by now, if they exist.
The trouble is, there are some very dark asteroids out there. And of course, there are some much smaller ones too.
How do we know Venus or Mercury doesn't have a small dark asteroid moon? Did any probes actually try radar to find them?
