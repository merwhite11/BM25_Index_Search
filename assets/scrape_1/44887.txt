Would people on opposite sides of the earth see different details of the moon, if so are there actual photos demonstrating this?

I am aware of phases and the fact that opposite sides will see the moon flipped relative to the other but what I’m asking specifically is would the almost 8000 mile difference between the two observers be enough for them to see different details near the edge of the moon?

So in this image, if there were 2 people on opposite sides of the earth each 90° from the person seen on top, would the person on the right see more of the right side of the moon while the one on the left couldn’t see some of that but could see more on the left?
If you have any examples of this with actual photos from each side I would love to be able to see the difference.
Thanks!
