Where does the Solar System end?

The Sun is roughly 4 light-years away from the closest star system, the Alpha Centauri system. The planets in our Solar System, however, aren't even close to that far away from the Sun. Where does our Solar System end? Is the edge considered to be the orbit of Neptune, the Kuiper Belt, the Oort Cloud, or something else?
