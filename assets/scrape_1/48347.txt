What exactly is the estimated distance to a far-off object when they say '50 Mpc/h' or '50 Mpc h^-1'? Is it less than 50 Mpc? Do you รท by 67 or 74?

Several recent arxiv.org papers I read mention distances to very distant objects in Mpc (megaparsecs) divided by Hubble's 'constant'....
Does that mean we should divide the Mpc or Gpc (gigaparsecs) by another number?  67 or 70 or 74 or whatever we believe the h parameter to actually be?
I am confused.....
