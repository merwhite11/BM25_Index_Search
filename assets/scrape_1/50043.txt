Using a 2" filter on the 1.25" adapter

I recently got a new 10" telescope which comes with a 2" to 1.25" reductor (something like whats seen here)
I have 2" and 1.25" eypiece, and want to buy a UHC filter, so my question is: if I buy the 2" filter, can I use it on the adapter when using the 1.25" eyepiece?
