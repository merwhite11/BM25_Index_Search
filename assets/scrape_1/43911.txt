If a black hole has a mass similar to a star, why does it have a different gravitational pull?

Say there is a black hole with 1 solar mass, having the sun's mass, it would have the same gravity as the sun, right? But it still has an event horizon, so why does it have such a strong gravitational pull despite its mass?
