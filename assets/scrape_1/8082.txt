Where can I learn these Astrophysical techniques? [Read below]

Whenever I read any Astro papers in http://arxiv.org/ they usually talk about Data fitting or modelling or sentences like 'we fitted the spectral region by analytic functions  i.e. by multi-component Gaussian model plus continuum'.
Is there any websites, online books or maybe YouTube videos which teaches these techniques in detail?
Any info will be much appreciated!
