Can moons exist inside a planet's roche limit?

Saturn's rings are inside its own Roche Limit - the limit beyond which bodies start disintegrating due to the tidal forces of the parent body. But as every rock in the ring can be regarded as a satellite of Saturn, why are they not disintegrated to smaller constituents? Also, is it possible for a body to hold itself together even within the Roche Limit (maybe due to some cohesive forces holding it together)? I thought it may be the reason for the rocks in Saturn's rings holding themselves together- but then again, I have no reason to believe it may be the case any way. Can someone provide an estimate for what the cohesive forces may be for a metallic rock as a fraction of the internal gravitational forces in it?
