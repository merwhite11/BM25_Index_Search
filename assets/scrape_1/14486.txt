How high does light pollution reach into the sky?

I want to know how high does light pollution typically reach into the sky straight up? Has anyone ever researched this because I wonder if being at 10000ft elevation would reduce the amount of light pollution from nearby cities because of the height assuming that light pollution weakens the higher you go. How high would it go straight up the sky (not to the sides about how far I would have to travel to have no light pollution disturbing the night sky)?
