Would a telescope that uses Fresnel lenses be more practical than using regular lenses?

If we were to make telescopes with Fresnel lenses instead of regular lenses, would it be more practical?  Would this also allow for much bigger telescopes to be made?
Here is an example of the type of lens I am talking about from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fresnel_lens-1.svg
