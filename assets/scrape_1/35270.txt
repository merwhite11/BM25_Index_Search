The goblin furthest

I just watched a documentary last night that stated a new discovery was so far away in our solar system the Hubble could only show it as a few blurred pixels, Robert Fosbury narrated and it was called Hubble 15 years of discovery. Also noted the same thing about “ Farout “
 It is 120 AU from the sun, 1 AU being about 93 million miles, so if Hubbles mirror can only define it as few blurred tiny pixels how again do we see 13.7 billion light years ?
