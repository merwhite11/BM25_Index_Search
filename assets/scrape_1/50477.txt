Why does Callisto only have eclipses every 3 years?

I don’t understand why Jupiter only eclipses Callisto in three year periods separated by three years. I get that the reason Callisto doesn’t always have eclipses is because of the combo of Jupiter’s slight tilt and the distance between Jupiter and Callisto, resulting in Callisto sometimes being completely out of Jupiter’s shadow. But why does this happen in 3 year intervals? I would assume eclipses would occur at certain points of the year, every year. I guess I don’t understand the full geometry of this.
