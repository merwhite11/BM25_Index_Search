Is it possible for a virus to come from a meteorite?

So I am not a true scientist and I was just wondering if an extraterrestrial rock from space can have some dangerous unidentified virus or bacteria that can be deadly and wipe out the Earth if it not quarantined. Is this science fiction?.
P.S.: Note I said extraterrestrial rocks not extraterrestrial as in aliens.
