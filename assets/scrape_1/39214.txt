Which eyepiece should I use to view planets with a Slokey Skyways 50080 telescope?

I am new to Astronomy. My husband bought a Skyways 50080 for me for my birthday. It's an f=500mm refractor made by Slokey. The 80mm aperture makes it a fast f/6.25.
It came with three eyepieces; 25, 10 and 6 mm, and a 3x Barlow lens.
I can see the moon very clearly, however I can't see Mars very well. I use the 10 mm eyepiece when viewing the planets, I am not sure if this is too high a magnification or not.
Which eyepieces should I be using to see the planets with this type of telescope? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
