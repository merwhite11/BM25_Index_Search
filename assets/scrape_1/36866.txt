How did Kepler come to the potencies in his Third Law?

How did Kepler come to the conclusion,  that exactly the square of the period and the third potency of the great semi-axis of the ellipse is proportional?
Why is only square divided by cubic = constant?  Why do other dimensions not work? Kepler certainly did not simply try all potencies.
Isn't this a similar problem to Fermat's last theorem?
