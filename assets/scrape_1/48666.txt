What is Canopus in this picture?

Picture is taken from 34.2N 126.6E Bogil-do, South Korea. I suppose the dot at up-right side is Rigel and the bright white dot is Sirius, and bright reddish dot at the bottom is light from some fishing boat in the foreground.
Then what is Canopus, of two dots next to fishing boat near the horizon? And what might be the identity of the other dot? (Satellites, airplane etc.)
