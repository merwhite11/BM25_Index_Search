Canon camera recommendation

I am an amateur astronomer looking to upgrade from a simple point and shoot camera looking through a Newtonian telescope to a more sophisticated set-up. I lecture at a local college and I am lucky enough that they may lend me a schmidt-cassegrain telescope (Celestron CPC series telescope).
I am looking to invest into my first DSLR camera and while I know Canon has their own dedicated astronomy camera (EOS Ra) such a camera is out of my budget. I have narrowed it down to four options and I would like to have more expert advice on which I should choose:

EOS 90D
EOS 77D
EOS 250D
EOS M50

I am lost to choose between those options. May you please shed some light? Thank you very much.
