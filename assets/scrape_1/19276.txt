Are we already moving faster than light?

Okay, so the speed of revolution of earth around sun is 30 km/s[1], speed of revolution of sun around milky way's center is ~200 km/s[2], speed of rotation of milky way is 828,000 km/h[3] i.e. 230000 m/s. Since speed of light is 300000000 m/s, so on an even bigger scale (bigger than clusters) are we already moving faster than the speed of light? Or am I totally wrong?
