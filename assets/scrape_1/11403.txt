How did New Horizons take such well-lit pictures of Pluto?

The photos of Pluto from New Horizons are truly beautiful.
But considering that Pluto is so far away from its nearest start - our Sun - how is it so well lit up? 
Did the New Horizons have a massive flash mounted on its camera to illuminate the planet or is there just a lot of ambient light in space? 
I'm really curious.
