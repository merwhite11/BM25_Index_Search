Why are Galaxy doppler Light Curves rising from the center of the Galaxy? Stars near the center of a Galaxy are moving faster than those near edge

Why are Galaxy Doppler Light Curves rising from a low point near the center of the Galaxy? Stars near the center of a Galaxy are moving faster than those near the edge. I understand that we probably can't see (measure the light from) the stars near the center of a galaxy that is exactly "edge on" to our view. But we should be able to measure Doppler effect of light from stars near the center of Galaxies that are tilted a bit to our view.
All the light curves I see in articles show the Doppler light curves indicating stars' velocities to rise from the Galaxy center. I'm not talking about the anomalous flat part of the curve nearer Galaxy edges. Thanks.
