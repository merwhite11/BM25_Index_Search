Why is Uranus called a "green planet"?

Uranus is called a green planet, although it appears blue in many of the photographs including those taken by spacecraft, like VoyagerÂ 2, Hubble, and JWST. NASA's Uranus page mentions it to be bluish-green.
One of the reasons mentioned is due to the presence of methane in the atmosphere of Uranus. But if that's the case, why can't we see this green color in the photos? I am unable to exactly grasp the mechanism behind the green color.
