App? for star charts compared to ancient world landmass locations

I have read many books which reference star locations in reference to specific world locations in ancient times. But is their an app/website which will show where a location was on the planet at a certain time in prehistory, and what the star chart visible at that location was? E.g. Rome, Athens, New York a million years ago and what the stars would look like from that spot?
