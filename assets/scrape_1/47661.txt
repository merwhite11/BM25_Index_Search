How can Io be tidally heated while it is in tidal lock?

According to its Wikipedia page:

Rotation period: synchronous
Eccentricity: 0.0041

But also

...extreme geologic activity is the result of tidal heating...

How is it possible? It should not be heated, if its rotation is synchronous, no tidal waves should exist in it.
