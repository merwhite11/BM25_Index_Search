Is it possible to infer information about the structure of the universe beyond the observable one?

Is it possible to infer information about the structure of the universe beyond the observable one, by observing its effects on the parts we can see? Can for example gravity from sources we cannot see affect objects which we can see, and allow us to calculate the mass or directions of the source?
