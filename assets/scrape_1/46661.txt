What's the mass distribution of elements created in neutron star mergers?

In charts like this, you'll see that a bunch of the heaviest elements mostly come from neutron star mergers. But what about the mass distribution of just the products of neutron star mergers? That is, how much of the stuff left over from a merger--excluding everything that falls into the newly formed black hole--becomes hydrogen, or iron, or gold?
