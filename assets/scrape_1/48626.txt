Why aren't concentrated solar power plants use for astronomical observations of some type?

Concentrated solar power plants use reflecting surfaces to gather the sun rays for energy production.

Currently they sit idle at night and are not used for anything.
These have huge collection areas, so I'm wondering why are they not used at night for astronomical observations of some type?
Depending on the reflector type it can be as simple as raising a radio antenna on top of the tower.
Pros:

They already able to track celestial bodies in the sky.
They already build. So extending them for a scientific use would cost a fraction of the cost compared to building a new radio array.
They are huge.


Cons:

Limited Frequency Range

I have always been fascinated by the ability of astronomers to extract information from a couple of pixels of data. So I think that this idea can be beneficial to the scientific community.
What do you think? Am I missing something obvious that makes this impractical?
