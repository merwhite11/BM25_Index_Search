Birthday of the Universe

With every improvement of measurement we are able to determine the age of the Universe more exactly. I just wondered how much and what means it would need to narrow the range of age so that it would be possible to determine the exact date of the Big Bang.
I know that this would take a lot of assumptions for the sake of simplicity - I am just curious; this being said: let us assume that all current theories hold and no new side effects or new theories would evolve.
I read this post and some physics articles about the matter, but my question focuses on the accuracy gap between our current best telescopes and the accuracy that would be needed to narrow down the age to "24 earth hours".
