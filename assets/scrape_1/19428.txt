What was Bradley's observation concerning abevation of light?

As far as I understand, the effect of parallax exhibits itself in the shift of a star relative to the background stars on photographs. 
As for the aberration of light, how is it reflected? It would not cause the relative shift of a star in a background, right? Because all the stars (the foreground one and the background ones) will be rotated as a whole, right? 
So, what was Bradley's observation?
