LSR and peculiar motion corrections to RAVE survey velocities

I am working towards getting a bunch of halo stars in our galaxy for my thesis. I am doing this with the help of a Toomre diagram and I am stuck. I am using the RAVE survey in conjunction with Gaia as the repository for my data. I have a few questions that I am struggling to get an answer to,

The RAVE survey has two kinds of velocities, heliocentric (helio_vx, helio_vy, helio_vz) and galactocentric (galcyl_vr, galcyl_vz, galcyl_vphi). I expect both of these velocities to produce the same diagram, however I am unsure whether the LSR and peculiar motion corrections of the solar system applies to both or none or one of them.
Assuming that the correction applies, are there packages available to do this transformation? I have checked astropy and the way they do it is by getting the radial velocity correction (radial_velocity_correction(kind='barycentric', obstime=None, location=None) and then applying the transformation to LSR (transform_to(LSR())). However, the problem is that it applies only to radial velocities. How do I do it for the other components?
Assuming that the LSR corrections are done, how do I correct for the peculiar motion of the solar system?

Cheers!
