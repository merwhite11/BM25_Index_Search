Can you see the stars when it is trickling?

I am writing a book with the following scene in one chapter: It is trickling and my protagonists are outside looking into the night sky, looking to the stars. Reviewing the scene I am wondering: Is this possible? Can you see the stars when it is trickling, or even when it rains? Are there images showing this?
