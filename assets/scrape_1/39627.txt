Can Quasars generate Heavy Elements?

Pretty sure Quasars were involved in increasing Galactic metallicity but is there evidence of quasar AGN's generating heavy elements, such as radioactive ones and shooting them across the universe in the relativistic jets? If there's no evidence is it theoretically possible?
