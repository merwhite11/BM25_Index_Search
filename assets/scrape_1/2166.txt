Red Moon a Characteristic of all Total Lunar Eclipses?

I understand that the redness of the moon during the total lunar eclipse last night/this morning (April 14-15 2014) is a reflection of the red light caused in earth's atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering (basically, a reflection of all the sunsets and sunrises happening around the earth).  Because of this, it seems to me that the moon will appear red during every total lunar eclipse that happens.  Is this the case, or are there some lunar eclipses where the moon does not turn red?  If it is the case that all total lunar eclipses produce a red moon, why was the media so hyped up about last night's eclipse producing a red moon?  Was it especially red?
