Is any meteorite known to come from a comet?

Comets are mostly icy but they should have some rocky components too, right? I wonder if there's any rocky piece of a former comet among collected meteorites. Is it possible today to identify a meteorite as having cometary origin? Or has surviving pieces from comet impacts been too rare (or violent vapourizing) events?
