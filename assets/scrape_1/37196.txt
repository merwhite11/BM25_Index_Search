How does using Tidal energy affect the moon?

Reading another question Where do we have it from that the Moon is migrating away from Earth?
I makes me ask what effect does harvesting tidal energy for electricity production have on the rate the moon gains angular momentum?
Presuming the most common harvesting methods involve underwater turbines in tidal zones with water flowing regularly in both directions (twice per day).
