Why do the planets in our solar system orbit in the same plane?

(Yes I'm excluding Pluto from this the same way it was excluded for not being a planet)
Observing the planets orbit of the Sun they all seem relatively planar and roughly all orbit along the same plane. 
Is this due to the way that our Solar system was formed or is this a physical phenomena observed in other systems?
