How can I measure the angle between two stars?

This is a backyard astronomy question.
My middle-school-aged son and I would like to measure the apparent angle between two easily-visible stars more precisely than measuring with our outstretched hands and fingers.  Our current technique gives measurements in fingers instead of degrees, and is really inconsistent depending on how we need to twist our arms, and his arms seem to be growing longer!
What are some inexpensive ways we can get a better measurement of the angle between two stars?
