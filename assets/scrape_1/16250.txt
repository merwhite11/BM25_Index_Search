If the planets only attract, then how can they stay in their orbit?

Gravity is related to mass, and gravity is an attracting force on every body. Then what happens when bodies only attract each other..without repulsion they may strike the sun. I think there must be a repulsive force. 
Another question arises, if only attraction is there, then why does the moon rotate elliptically around the earth?
And Mars comes closer to earth after 3 years?
