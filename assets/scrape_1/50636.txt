Is it possible for the Milky Way and Andromeda to get ejected upon colliding instead of merging?

The Milky Way and Andromeda are destined to collide and merge within the next 4-5 billion years, but I feel like there could be a chance that instead of merging, they could just eject each other. I dunno, but is it possible, and if so, how likely will it be?
