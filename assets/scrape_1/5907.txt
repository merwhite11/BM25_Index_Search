How were the designations of "North" and "South" applied to the hemispheres of Mars?

How was it decided which hemisphere was North and which hemisphere was South on Mars? Clearly, the designations "North" and "South" apply only to the hemispheres which contain the axis of rotation at their center, but what determined whether a hemisphere received "North" or "South" as its designation?
