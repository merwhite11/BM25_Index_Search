Is pointing a telescope at a random place a viable astronomical strategy?

Recently I happened to be on the MAST portal, looking at jwst data. I happened to come across 2 interesting targets, “random place” and “another random place”
This got me thinking. It’s almost impossible to know what the scientists who pointed jwst at a random place were thinking. However, it’s interesting to think about if this is something that is beneficial, or at least not largely detrimental. It also occurred to me that at some point someone would have to point a telescope at a random point in order to discover things.
So, is pointing telescopes at random places a viable method of doing astronomy, and if so what are examples?
