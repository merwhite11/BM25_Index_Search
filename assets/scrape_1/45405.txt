Could stars be seen from inside a nebula?

Nebulae look dark against the backdrop of stars, but how opaque are they likely to be from inside?
In other words, if our Solar System had drifted into the middle of, say, the Horsehead Nebula, would we be able to see any stars through it, or would their light be blotted out?
