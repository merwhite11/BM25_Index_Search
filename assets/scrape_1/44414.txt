Which version of Stellarium made you fly from one moon to another?

I recall a version of Stellarium (it was the very first time I had Stellarium) many years ago that made you fly between moons of the same system if you changed celestial bodies. E.g. if you were on Titan and wanted to go to Mimas or to the parent planet Saturn, it made it appear as if you actually flew from Titan to Mimas or to Saturn, unlike in later versions in which you just immediately teleport to the other body. Do you know which version that was?
I think it was 0.12.x but I checked one out, you still teleport immediately to the other body. It may have been an even older version. What else I can tell you about that version is that on the frequency of meteors you could only pick either 0 or 10 or 100 or 1000 per hour or so, you couldn't enter a random number unlike in newer versions. It's a pity Stellarium disabled the translunar flights (or can you enable it somewhere?). Maybe someone around here knows which version that would be.
