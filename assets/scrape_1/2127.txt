Einstein General relativity and bending of space

As Einstein's General relativity suggests that the space 
time curves in the presence of matter, which is experimentally
proven too, this phenomenon also explains orbits. My question
is if the presence of mass curves space-time, in which direction 
does it bend, if we assume that it bends in one of all possible
directions then what makes the body to choose that particular 
direction. Does all the bodies bend the space-time in the same
direction ?
