moving light with a fading pulse, very bizarre

October 9th southeast of Denver about 6 miles, looking northwest in the sky approximately 10 inches to the left of Alkaid, a bright light, what at first glance might have been a star, began moving upward about 10 inches with the naked eye. As it moved, it faded out. Then it would appear in the original location and repeat.
This went on for about 5 minutes and then stopped.
I captured video that I intended on a bit of video forensics but I would like to see if anyone can offer up an explanation?
Thanks.
