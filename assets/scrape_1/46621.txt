What are the most efficient ways to terraform Neptune's moon Triton?

I have seen on various sites and on youtube videos pertaining to the terraform of various planets and moons that are not habitable for now but they can be habitable in near future.
What are the ways through which scientists can do this impossible task as we all know that Triton (Neptune's moon) have nitrogen dominating atmosphere and also consists of methane and carbon monoxide.
