Why would a quantity like the 'Hubble contrast' be squared, then have its square root taken?

From Sabine Hossenfelder's recent video, New Evidence AGAINST Standard Cosmology:

And her source....


Figure 2. The variation with increasing void radius of the variance of the Hubble parameter, the density contrast, the density parameter and the peculiar velocity for the CDM power-law and CHDM bump models, given the WMAP5 and SDSS data (with 1Ïƒ limits).

I don't get why a graph would show a quantity that is squared, then immediately 'square-rooted' such as $\langle \delta^2_H \rangle^{1/2}, \langle \delta^2 \rangle^{1/2}, \langle \delta^2_{\Omega} \rangle^{1/2} \ \text{and} \ \langle v^2 \rangle^{1/2}$.
Also, the lowercase delta does stand for the Hubble constant difference or contrast, correct?
