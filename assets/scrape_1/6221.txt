What is the exact position of the Large Magellanic Cloud?

I am not able to visualize the position of the LMC and have not found a satisfactory explanation...
Can someone please answer it this way?
Relative to a ray joining the Earth to the Galactic-Center(Milky Way's), please describe the position in the plane of the ray as- to the South/East/West or their combinations. And will the galaxy be below/above the plane of the ray?
Note: Please consider the direction of the ray(Earth->Center) as the axis of a compass that points towards the north.
E.g://Answer format that i was hoping for:
   To the South-West of the Segment, and below its plane.
