Why does squinting make hard-to-see objects clearer?

So I, like most other astronomy enthusiasts, have, at some point, not been able to see something clearly, such as a star, and have had to squint to be able to see it better. When this happens, the object seems to become clearer, but the light seems to gain a cross, or sometimes a hexagon, or an irregular line shape when doing so. I've noticed a similar effect on different models of telescopes, especially the newtonian reflector series. More on this here: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe3NN1yPzM). Is this a similar effect on the eye? But more importantly how does squinting improve the quality of the picture?
