Why do tides reach a peak two days after the solar eclipse?

On June 21st we, in India, experienced a total solar eclipse. Based on my basic understanding of why tides occur, the tidal forces by moon and sun add up and the tides will be maximum on the day of eclipse.
But to my surprise, tides kept on rising for next two days and reached a maximum on June 23rd.

It doesn't make much sense to me. Can anyone please clarify.
