Kardashev scale

Why is becoming a type 3 from a type 2 civilization the hardest?
I have watched many videos on the topic and still can't figure out why?
Also is there a difference in technology between a type 4 and a type 5 civilization or it is just all type 4 civilizations become type 5 civilizations after some time?
