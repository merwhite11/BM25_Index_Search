The orbital period of Jupiter and Europa billions of years later

We know that the Sun gets so big billions of years later and the Earth will get destroyed.
What will the orbital period of Jupiter (Sun-Jupiter system) and its moon Europa (Jupiter-Europa system) be when the habitable zone reaches Europa? Also, what will the side-real rotation period be for the two objects?
Is there a way to calculate them?
