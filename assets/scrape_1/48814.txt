Which galaxies have the most well known / estimated dark matter halos?

For this I guess you need

accurate circular velocity measurements of the stars in the galaxy
a decent luminosity profile for the galaxy
some analysis which looks at the discrepancy between the two

The Milky Way seems to have been studied a lot, with decent mass models (e.g. McMillan 2011) and circular velocity observations (e.g. Eilers 2019 which includes mean observational data actually tabulated rather than graphed) is readily available.
What I'm wondering is which other galaxies have this kind of data? Or indeed at least have decent luminosity profiles & circular velocity observations even if the halo has yet to be analysed.
Massive thank you!
