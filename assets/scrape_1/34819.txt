Where and when will someone on Earth be standing with the floor parallel to the Ecliptic plane?

I have been trying to figure this out and I think the answer might be - once per day for anyone living on the Tropic of Cancer or Capricorn. Is that right? To be clear - I want to know where on Earth and when/how often a person standing upright will be standing with the floor parallel to the ecliptic plane? Thank you for your help!
