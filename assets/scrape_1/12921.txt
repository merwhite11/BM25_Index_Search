If the Sun were bigger but colder, Earth would be hotter or colder?

That is the question. I know the concepts of luminosity $(L=4\pi R^2F)$ and the flow $F=\sigmaÂ· T^4$, with $T$ the temperature in its surface. But how I use that to know if the Earth would get warmer or not if $R$ increases and $T$ decreases?
