I too saw a star like object moving across the sky it appeared to be a star moving!

I too saw a star like object moving across the sky from Bournemouth towards say Parkstone, it appeared to be a star moving for quite a long time until it disappeared from my view!
I have seen this the last two nights and so have my family, it's not the Space Station as I see this regularly as my Star Walk app, you can add in when you know what the object is! But unless I know the name of this object I can't track it on my app, does anyone know what it could Be?
It is not a plane as far too high like a star moving but fast across the sky? This was timed 22:10 on Sunday August 28th 2017
