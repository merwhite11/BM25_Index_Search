Are telescope eyepieces ever made with a diopter adjustment (similar to DSLRs)?

I am learning about eyepieces, and "eye relief" and what sorts of eyepieces an amateur may want for their purposes, and was wondering if there are eyepieces with diopter adjustments, or if, due to the optical systems in reflecting and refracting telescopes, diopter adjustment like those in a DSLR viewfinder are never found in the designs of eyepieces.
