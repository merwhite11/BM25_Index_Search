What will happen to the Galilean moons after the Sun dies(assuming no human effects)

Will the system go completely unstable due to all the mass loss the moons and jupiter experienced,will it already have gone unstable before this,or will they keep the resonance,if they keep it,will the moons just fall into jupiter one by one due to tidal dissipation?Or will they be ejected/have collided due to encounters before this?
