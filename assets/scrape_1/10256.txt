Gravitational pull needed to keep a gas in atmosphere

How can you determine the gravitational force needed to keep a particular gas in the atmosphere of a planet (for example, carbon dioxide (CO2))?
I came across the following formula $\left(\frac{8RT}{Ï€M}\right)^{0.5}$
here: http://www.tau.ac.il/~roichman/CVI/hw1/hw1.pdf
$M$ = Molecular mass 
$R$ = Gas constant
$T$ = Temperature
Would this formula apply?
