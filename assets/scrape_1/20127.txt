So, what exactly is an 'ultra-cool' dwarf star?

The TRAPPIST-1 system is around an ultra-cool dwarf star. I went looking for more information on that kind of star, and found very little. The Wikipedia article on it lengthened from a minimal stub to one paragraph in the 15 minutes from when I began the search, after the press conference on the discovery of 7 Earth-sized planets in orbit around TRAPPIST-1.
What kind of star is this?
