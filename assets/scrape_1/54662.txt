How did scientists decide the boundary of the Milky Way at Edwin Hubble times?

I know Edwin Hubble used Cepheid variables to prove the Andromeda Galaxy is not part of the Milky Way. But how did scientists at that time decide the boundary of the Milky Way?
And how did they find out both Andromeda and Milky Way are just the local group galaxies and the whole universe is much bigger than that?
