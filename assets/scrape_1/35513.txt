Which of the planets would be detected if they were exoplanets?

An (almost-)omnipotent being selects the solar system, presses Ctrl+C, and then Ctrl+V several times, creating copies at distances of 5, 500, 50.000, and 5.000.000 light-years away. All in a direction where the instruments we have are currently directed that way.
So we see these four star systems at various distances. 
With our current technology, of 2020, which of the planets will we discover in each of these distances?
