Will dark energy always repulse observable/dark matter?

We know that the universe is expanding at an increasing accelerated rate, but the ratio of dark energy to observable matter remains constant as dark energy remains constant (please correct me on this).
Moreover, some say that new galaxies are no longer formed excluding the galaxies that collide and form a new galaxy.
Now my question is will the below pie-chart always stay the same, if so then what will eventually cause  the expansion to stop and mark the end of the universe?
