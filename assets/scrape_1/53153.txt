where are we in the universe as compared to the observable universe?

For distant galaxies to be accelerating away at equal speed in every direction, Earth would have to be at the centre of the universe. Since it is not, some region of the distant galaxies should appear to be retreating faster and this increased speed would be a function of how far the Earth is away from the centre.
Assuming light travels at the same speed in all directions, earth is at the center of the observable universe. Since we are part of the expanding universe, how far has "earth" travelled since the big bang?
The  distant galaxies around the observable universe periphery provide the references to access the relative  motion of the earth.
