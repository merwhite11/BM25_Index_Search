Sky density of milky-way stars vs external galaxies

I am interested to know if any particular slice of sky contains more galaxies or more stars (in the milky way, although would be interested to factor in extra-galactic stars, and even rogue planets)
How does this vary across the direction of the sky relative to the core of the milky way?
