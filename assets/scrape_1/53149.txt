How to calculate distance between stars?

I have data on nearby stars, including galactic coordinates and distance from Sun. And I have a dilemma.
In a story I'm writing, I have two starfaring alien civilisations. One originates from a planet orbiting Delta Pavonis and has a few settlements on nearby (to Delta Pavonis) stars. The second civilisation originates from a planet orbiting a star near Delta Pavonis as it is attacking the first civilisation.
But two stars that are at a similar distance from Sun, let's say, 12 light years, might be very far apart from each other as they are on opposite sides of the sky.
Thus my question is, knowing the galactic coordinates of stars and distances from the Sun, how to calculate distances between the two stars?
