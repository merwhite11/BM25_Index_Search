What is Hubbles WFC3 "UVIS 47 G200" filter? What is it used for? How to find an example?

Extensive reading for Are the dispersion directions of the prism and the grating in Hubble WFC3 UVIS G280 perpendicular? Can we call this a "grism"? With cross-disparsion? led me to Instrument Science Report WFC3 2003-02; WFC3 UVIS Filters: Measured Throughput and Comparison to Specifications.
Table 1: "UVIS Filter Performance Specifications from Version D JPL Spec or CEI" lists near the bottom
