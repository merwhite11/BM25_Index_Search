Combined mass of binary stars

This is Question 17 from USAAAO Practice Round 2015. The answer is D. It would be best if someone can detail out the workings.

In a nearby star system, two stars are seen to orbit each other every
  8 years. At their closest, the stars are 2” apart. At their furthest,
  they are 18” apart. If a parallax of 0.5” is observed for the star
  system, what is its combined mass in solar masses? Assume an
  inclination of 90 degrees. 

a. 0.5
b. 1
c. 2
d. 4
e. 8


What I got so far:

Distance to system: 2pc (6.171e16 m)
Minimum separation: 5.98e11 m
Maximum separation: 5.38e12 m
Relative semimajor axis: 2.99e12 m (20AU)
Combined mass: 125 solar masses
