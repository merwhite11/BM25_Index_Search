Can you tell me which star this is?

Back-story:
My daughter, age 2, looked up in the Ohio sky (we have very poor star-viewing compared to Arizona) and pointed at a light.  She said "what is that".  I said "that is a star, honey".  She said "can you get it for me, I can't reach".
I have an app named skyview and I took a screenshot, but I lost the name.  It was visible from Ohio at 9:27pm on the 5th of September; the image was nearly straight up.  what its name was.
Here is the image:

Update: I know what Jupiter is, and the skyview app shows it as a Voyager-style picture of the planet.  I'm sure the star she wanted was not Jupiter.  I do not remember
Here is what Jupiter looks like in the app.  The background is my cubicle, not the night sky.

Question:
Can you help me determine which star it is?
I think it is Gliese, but I can't remember and I don't know with any confidence.
Extra credit:
How do I give it to her.  I'm thinking of getting it painted by an artist.  If it has planets or is a multi-star system that would go well in a painting.  Understanding some of the stellar dynamics would also be a help in making a reasonable rendering.  Also, can you tell me any of the names of the decently capable artists who render quasi-realistic astronomic bodies that I might be able to ask to render this.
