TASCO 49060700 60x700mm Spacestation Refractor

So, my grandfather so graciously gave me his TASCO 49060700 60x700mm Spacestation Refractor Telescope, which is extremely wondrous. Any way, I found this answer to my 3x barlow lens, which I believe is saying multiply the magnification on the lens to the barlow. I've got three separate lenses; 25mm, 10mm, and a 4mm. My question is, do I multiply 25 by three(25 being the 25mm) and I get 75x magnification?
