Why does any planet look like a (not so) big white ball through my telescope?

I have a 130mm (5") diameter Newtonian reflector with a 650mm focal length (f/5). I have collimated my telescope already but when I'm looking at Mars or Jupiter (not a star I'm sure), all I see is a white dot. Even if I use my 6mm with a 2x barlow, Mars still looks like a white dot but with a liiittle bit of a gray shade like a 3/4 moon. Of course I focused my eyepiece before. Why can't I see Mars or any other planet better than that ?
