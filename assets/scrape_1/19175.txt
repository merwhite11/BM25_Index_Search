Do we know if we are overtaking or falling behind our arm?

Here's our galaxy as best we know, courtesy of this Wikipedia article:

It seems that as best we know, each arm is a compressed or brighter area (rather like a wave).

Looking at that image, do we know/guess if the arm-patterns are rotating? Or do they just sit there statically, unchanging from that diagram? Which way does it rotate, cw or acw per that diagram? (If we know.)
If the pattern is rotating - how long does it take it to rotate 360 degrees? As far as we know?

And hence ..

Indeed, is the arm-pattern catching us and moving through us ... or is the arm pattern slower than us and we're moving through it?
