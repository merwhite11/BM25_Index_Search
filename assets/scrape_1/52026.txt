Telescopes with equatorial mount and "catching" stars

I have a misunderstanding of principles behind using telescopes with equatorial mount (I don't have it yet, only trying to grasp the idea). For example, I would like to watch Betelgeuse in the telescope, steps to do it:

aligning telescope's polar axis with Polaris
getting Betelgeuse's coordinates - right ascension 05h 55m 10.30536s and declination  +07° 24′ 25.4304″
put RA add DEC to corresponding axis

Will Betelgeuse be visible through a telescope all night?
