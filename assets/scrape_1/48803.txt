What kind of perspective projection is shown in this image?

I’m trying to develop software that overlays sky coordinates over 2d images of the sky taken by an iphone. I’ve done the sky coordinates part, but I’m trying to figure out what kind of perspective projection I could assume my iphone lens uses. Could you tell from these 2 images attached (that I have manually labelled) what kind of projection it is?
