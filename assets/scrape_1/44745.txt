Why aren't there any images of Sun-orbiting bodies by Spitzer?

Why didn't the Spitzer space telescope shoot images of (dwarf) planets around the Sun, or did it? Even though its primary goal was to detect (the characteristics of) exoplanets, it could have revealed something about Solar System Bodies as well, and perhaps discover new SSBs. The Webb telescope will be infrared too but will also study SSBs.
