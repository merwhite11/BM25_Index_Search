Why are galaxies disk shaped?

I always see galaxies in "disk" shape in pictures. It is like, there is a rotational movement on a plane and the system is balanced by the pulling-in gravitational force which prevents the stars to leap out of the galaxy. What is the physical reason behind this? I have never seen a star in disk shape. A star is nothing but a much much smaller non-solid mass revolving around an axis, just like the galaxies. Does size matter? What makes the difference? Why doesn't a typical galaxy form in a spherical shape rather than a disk shape?
