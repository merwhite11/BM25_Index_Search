Need help in choosing a used telescope for a beginning observer

I am a beginner when it comes to telescopes and have been doing research online for a week with which one to buy. At the moment I’m interested in a pre-owned telescope. My priority is planets but also gaze to Andromeda if possible. I read that refractives are better for planets but I’m not finding them in my area maybe. Here are some that are available in my area:

Celestron 114LCM (114 mm aperture, f/8.77 Newtonian) Computerised: I like that it has a motor that can automatically pin point to an object so will help me. But it’s a bit easy to locate the Moon, Jupiter and Saturn so do I even need it?
Celestron Astromaster 130 EQ (114 mm aperture (not 130) f/8.7 Newtonian): it has better clarity I guess? But problem is, it is all manual and bulky. Means I have to adjust it every time I have to watch something new or to show to people. Also, it comes with heavy weight to might be difficult to carry around?
Celestron Star Sense Explorer LT 127AZ (127 mm aperture, f/7.87 Newtonian)

I'm not asking a "shopping question" so don't tell me what to buy. But I would like some input about what criteria I can use to choose between these; are they all basically equivalent? Are there some types of features (in this class of telescope) that may be more important than others from the point of view of a beginning observer?
