density of dark matter halo

I was surfing the net for knowing the actual density of dark matter halo for a particular Mh(Mass of the halo) and finally, I got two equations:
 for pseudo-isothermal halo
and
 by NFW-profile
So, with which density distribution of dark matter halo should I go corresponding to any Mh?
