Does liquid water on Mars means life?

We need to figure if liquid water is present throughout a Mars year, and how long the planet has been at its current distance from Sun. That will give us the length of time that liquid water has been present.
We can then compare this with Earth's data to figure out how long life would have had to evolve and what state it may have reached. In particular would there have been enough time for humanoids to evolve?
Would the different composition of the atmosphere and surface gravity produce life that looks different to that on Earth today?
