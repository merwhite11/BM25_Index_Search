What are some night sky objects I could see with my Celestron UpClose 20x50 Porro Binocular?

I bought this binocular because I've read countless times that one should start with a pair of binoculars before diving into telescopes. I've seen details of the moon and I can notice Venus round shape on some nights. I also saw Jupiter and it's two larger moons, as faint as the faintest stars, but this was on a beach trip so the sky was clearer than what I'm used to.
I live on a place with a 7 or 6 on the Bortle Scale, is there something else I should try to see?
