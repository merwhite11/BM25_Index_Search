Is there a way to know how the magnetic field was at the very beginning of our universe?

I recently read that 

Gamma-ray bursts are catastrophic events, related to the explosion of massive stars 50 times the size of our sun. If you ranked all the explosions in the universe based on their power, gamma-ray bursts would be right behind the Big Bang,

I'm asking this question in the tentative to compare the Big Bang to a gamma-ray burst. I keep in mind that a key difference between both is that Big Bang was Not an explosion, but want to know similarities to point out.
Near the formation of a black-hole they tell in this same article that matter and magnetic field play a key role the gamma-ray bursts.
I know magnetic fields are induced by charge displacement. Is it possible there was a kind magnetic field before protons and electrons formed, or during the first expansion phase?
Here are pictures I modified from Wikipedia's chronology of the universe to illustrate:


Do we have a way to know how magnetic fields were at that time?

Any way we could have information on magnetism at this point of universe creation?


In the Electroweak Era?
During the Great Unification Theory (GUT) Era?
And then in the Plank Era?
