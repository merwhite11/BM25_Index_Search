Should we fear Wolf-Rayet WR-104?

I've read on Quora about Wolf-Rayet binary star WR-104, which is thought to be a precursor to a supernova explosion with two accompannying gamma ray bursts. It looks as if the rays will travel in our direction, but it is also said the ray is of by 30 degrees. Not sure what to think, so I thought to ask here. Will it have a real effect on Earth? The comments are pretty disturbing.
