Why is the moon's motion more complicated than that of those planets?

I am of course not an expert on astronomy. But from the literature, I have the impression that the lunar motion is very complicated. It seems that Kepler can make sense of the motion of the planets but cannot do that for the moon. 
So, why is the moon's motion more complicated than that of planets like Mars?
