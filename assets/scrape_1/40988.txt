Does a star's rotation always match a planet's orbit?

For a planet orbiting a star, is it ever possible for a star to be rotating in the opposite way on it's own axis compared to the planet that is orbiting the star?
Or do gravitational forces mean the planet will always orbit a star with the same rotational direction as the star's axis rotation ?
