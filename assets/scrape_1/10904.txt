Calculate time when star is above altitude 30°

To find the best observation time for an object, I'd like to calculate the time when it is 30° or more above the horizon. Local Sideral Time would be sufficient.
To include that in my program, I need the formula.
Example:
On June 4th, Jupiter has the coordinates
RA= 9h 19m 28.0s
Dekl= 16° 32' 0"
It rises at 10:32 and sets at 00:05.
After rise, when is it at altitude 30°, and after transit, when is it at altitude 30° again ?

I found this formula at http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/riset.html. Although it's for the sun, it seems to be what I'm looking for.
$$\cos (\text{LHA}) = \frac{\sin (\text{h}) - \sin (\text{lat}) \times \sin (\text{Decl})}{\cos (\text{lat}) \times \cos (\text{Decl})}$$
Applied to the sample assuming a latitude of 45° I get.

Is this the correct approach?
