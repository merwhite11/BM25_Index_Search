How bad could we reasonably expect a solar flare to impact earth, and what can be done to mitigate the impact?

According to numerous articles, solar flares have done damage to the power grid on Earth in the past: http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/06may_carringtonflare/

How bad can we expect a severe solar flare to impact the power grid / electronics?  Would a bad flare also break electronics (e.g. computers), or "just" the power grid?
Is there anything that can be done to reduce the effects?
