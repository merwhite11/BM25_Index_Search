Is there anything like a supermassive white hole? How are they formed? And where are they present?

The idea of a 'super massive white hole' is sometimes discussed regarding GR,SR and the destination of material 'lost' in a black hole. Is there any good theoretical or observational evidence for these SWH, or are they merely metaphysical speculations?
