Next eyepiece for my telescope; how do decide which one to get?

I have an Astronomers Without Borders telescope with 650 mm focal length and 130 mm aperture. To go with them, I have a 10 mm and wide eye relief 25 mm eyepiece.
I tried to view Jupiter with the 10 mm, but all it appears to be is a small white dot, as if it is a star; its moons are even smaller pinpricks. Answers to Choosing an eyepiece for planet viewing seems to suggest that the telescope I have is good enough to see quite a bit of detail--including Jupiter's bands and colors--and that something is wrong with my stargazing (collimation, viewing conditions, or problems with the telescope/eyepiece itself).
I'm considering getting a 4 and 6 mm eyepiece as well.
What should I consider in order to decide which eyepiece focal length and type/design to get next?
