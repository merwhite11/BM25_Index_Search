Long-lived supernova remnants?

We cannot see the supernova remnant of the star that triggered the formation of the Sun and the Solar System, as the remnant dispersed and became mixed into the interstellar medium. So I am wondering, what is the maximum size/age of a supernova remnant/planetary nebula can reach before it can no longer be distinguished?
