How distorted will our galaxy be if we are viewing it from several thousand light years away?

I saw this answer and read this sentence regarding the distortion of our galaxy when viewed above the galactic plane:

Once you got to a point where the entire [sic] galaxy was within your vision, the entire galaxy would look distorted, since our galaxy is 100,000 light years [sic] across, the light from the edges of the Galaxy would be thousands of years old, and would not match up with how the spiral should appear.

I am thinking that this could potentially be true, but I am not sure why or how distorted it would be. Does this fact hold, and for what distances will it no longer be distinguishable?
Note: I have thought that it will be well-blended because the distance does not spike, it increases gradually, but I need verification.
