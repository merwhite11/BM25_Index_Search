Spin-down of gas-giants during formation

In the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00457 about rotation rates of gas giants it says:
"owing to accumulation of angular
momentum stored in the source material, a planetary mass object should rotate at or near breakup towards the end of the phase of rapid of gas accretion (irrespective of whether the object
formed through core accretion or via gravitational instability). In light of this expectation and the
discussion presented above, another mechanism is needed to reduce the rotation rate to values
well below break-up, and counteract spin-up due to gravitational contraction and accretion.
Because our observations do not show a statistically significant dependence of angular velocities
on age, we speculate that the spin-down process (whatever it may be) operates exclusively
during the disk-bearing stage of evolution."
Question: What mechanisms would cause the rotation of a gas giant to slow down, assumming that the planet is far enough from its star that tidal interaction with the star won't slow it down?
