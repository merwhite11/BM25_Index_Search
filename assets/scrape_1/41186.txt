In how far is Hipparcos data still being used?

I remember being excited when ESA launched Hipparcos in 1989 and was in operation until 15 August, 1993. Later, Gaia came into operation in 2013.
Reading What is the overlap between the Gaia and the Hipparcos catalog? I started wondering whether any of the Hipparcos data is still being used and for what. Could somebody please guide me with a concise explanation?
