Camera settings for Astrophotography

I own an Orion 10015 StarBlast 4.5 Astro Reflector Telescope and I recently bought a Lumix G7 camera then I bought the adapter needed to attach the camera to the telescope.
I tested it today at morning while it was still dark and for some reason I cannot focus the things I am seeing through the camera attached to the telescope.
I was trying to focus Venus and other objectives but I got this, do the camera need to have some specific settings for it? The telescope by itself works as usual, I use it almost every day.
Thanks in advance.
These are the adapters.
