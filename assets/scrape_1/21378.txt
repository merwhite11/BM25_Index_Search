What is germane doing in the atmosphere of Jupiter?

Germane (GeH4) has been detected in the atmosphere Jupiter.
Its formation from the elements seems to be thermodynamically unfavorable because its enthalpy of formation is positive and (I think) it has lower entropy than the free elements.
So what the heck is it doing there, considering free germanium would sink and free hydrogen would float?
