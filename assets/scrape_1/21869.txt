Rule of Exception in All Nearest Objects

I once heard of a strange phenomenon, but now cannot find anything about it on the Internet.  I might be looking for the wrong keywords or misremember some relevant aspect.  So maybe someone here can help me out and point me in the right direction.
The described phenomenon goes like this, as I remember it:
During the course of the scientific research, people found out more and more about the objects surrounding us.  Moon, Sun, planets, other stars, other galaxies, etc.  But each time (more or less) a little later (after a new discovery was getting an established fact) it showed that the closest object of this kind to Earth was rather an exception among its peers.  For instance, the closest other galaxy is blue-shifted.  Or that the closest Pulsar is somehow an exception among its peers.
It might be that the rule was not about the closest but about the first found object of a kind.
I think I remember Prof Harald Lesch (a German physicist lecturing on TV in a popular format called "Alpha Centauri") mentioning this peculiar phenomenon and fleshing it out with some examples, but now I'm not able to find the clip.
I understand the point about closing this question, but maybe leave it open for some weeks (or months), just in case somebody drops by who has something to contribute.  After a grace period the non-reaction can be counted as a vote for "isn't common knowledge".  Without such a grace period closing the question can only be based on "I don't know such a thing" (which should not be enough).
The concrete questions (because that was asked for, so it seemed to be unclear to some people) are:

Is such a phenomenon known?
Is there a source describing it?


Nice to have:  Which of the Alpha Centauri lectures was probably the one introducing me to the topic?

Is there a name to it?
What are examples of such objects?
