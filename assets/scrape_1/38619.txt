What is the shape of Universe?

What we can assume by the shape of universe. As I know when we talk about universe we talk about multi dimension structure but that structure should have some shape. I wonder that if we look the Universe from a far distance, how it will look like?
I know people will tell that its infinite we can't go outside universe and see, but assume if its true that universe has some end and its too far and out of our reach due to our limitation but exists.
I feel that its a kind of myth or assumption that universe is infinite everything is finite in this universe.
Do you remember in early times around 1000 years before humans used to think that earth is flat and infinite?
But after many years we reach to conclusion that earth is round.
Don't you think we are misunderstanding universe the same way we did before for Earth?
