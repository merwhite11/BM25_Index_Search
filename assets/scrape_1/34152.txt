Different sizes of bow shocks

In this image of LL Ori bow shock, 

there is a smaller bow shock at the upper right.  Is that second bow shock substantially smaller than the LL Ori bow shock, or is it just much further away?  If the stars are reasonably close, is the upper star significantly smaller that it is producing a much smaller bow shock?  The LL Ori bow shock is measured about half a light-year across.  Any estimates of the size of the smaller one?
