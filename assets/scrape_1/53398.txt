Are short-period comets more stable (in their orbits) than long-period ones?

Why the sharp distinction between short-period (P) comets of less-than-200-year orbits and those (C) with even slightly longer ones?
To explore the possibility that it has to do with stability, I will first need to ask: Are short-period comets more stable (in their orbits) than long-period ones?
