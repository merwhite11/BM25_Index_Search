How can a singularity actually exist?

Probably a stupid question, but it "bothers" me and I can't find a concrete answer on the internets.
When you fall into a black hole, afaik, time slows down for the matter falling in as it gets blasted by high energy light incoming as the universe speeds up, relative to that matter. 
Doesn't that mean though that the matter falling in never completely reaches the center? 
It seems that the "core" of the black hole would be made of whatever was there at the time of the collapse with time not really flowing for it, and incoming matter would slow down as it fall and be in a almost suspended state as it gets closer to center through the event horizon.
But again, all my knowledge here is based on random YouTube, so I'd love to learn more about it if there are any resources touching that aspect... 
Thanks!
