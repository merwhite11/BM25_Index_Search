How do we measure the current positions of galaxies?

I do wonder how do we measure current position of galaxies since all the information transfer speed of the universe is limited by the light speed.
My understanding is the we can only measure the galaxies or stars when the light from them reached to us. For example, we now know Andromeda is approximately 2.5 ml light years away, that means isn't it what we are seeing Andromeda's last 2.5 ml years' position.
And isn't it Andromeda is moving somewhere within those years and we just can't see it yet its current position? If it is so, is it like moving an invisible object toward us?
