Is moisture harmful to a Newtonian Reflector?

It is often cold outside, especially in the evening. So when I take my Newtonian Reflector back in my house, it starts condense.
Can the water destroy my telescope? or the mirrors? Do I have to clean it?
My telescope is fully painted, but I'm afraid of the screws. Screws often rust.
