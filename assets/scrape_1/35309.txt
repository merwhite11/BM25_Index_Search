How many meteorites have been found some place other than Earth? Where is an authoritative list maintained?

Backgound:
After seeing this tweet by astronomer Kacper Wierzchoś about our not-so-new but at least newly-discovered "mini-moon" I scrolled down and saw the tweeted image below.
The object is the known short-period comet 114P/Wiseman–Skiff. The article goes on to say:

Comet 114P/Wiseman–Skiff is believed to have been the parent body of the first meteor photographed from Mars

Context:
and that article says

As on Earth, when a meteor is large enough to actually impact with the surface (without burning up completely in the atmosphere), it becomes a meteorite. The first known meteorite discovered on Mars (and the third known meteorite found someplace other than Earth) was Heat Shield Rock. The first and the second ones were found on the moon by the Apollo missions.

This doesn't mention Egg Rock (as discussed in Who discovered “Egg Rock”? The Curiosity rover or people?) so we know that there must be at least four meteorites found some place other than Earth.
But I don't yet know how many there are in total
Question: How many meteorites have been found some place other than Earth? Where is an authoritative tally or listing actively maintained?
