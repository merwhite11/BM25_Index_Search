Why is the statement "black holes make up 1% of the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy" unknown?


a) We cannot detect all black holes and therefore don't know the percentage of the galaxy's mass they make up.

b)  We do not know the mass of the Milky Way's central black hole.

c) According to our understanding of stellar evolution, black holes should make up a much lower percentage of the galaxy's mass.

d) According to our understanding of stellar evolution, black holes should make up a much higher percentage of the galaxy's mass.


In my own understanding, I feel like it should be a). Since the black holes are forming all the time, I think it is hard to detect all of them. But I am not quite sure, could someone give any insight?
