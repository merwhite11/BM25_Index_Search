Do brown dwarf 'stars' fuse simple hydrogen (p-p reaction) at all?

I sometimes read that only deuterium-deuterium fusion can occur in brown dwarfs... And maybe deuterium-proton fusion? To He-3?
In order to overcome Coulombic repulsion and, occasionally, fuse, protons have to be continuously jammed together under immense pressure and heat...
Does this still happen, albeit less often, in brown dwarfs?
Can even free protons in the icy cold of outer space fuse together, perhaps via the magic of quantum tunneling?
(I understand that even inside true stars like our Sun, colliding protons only form deuterium about one-in-ten-octillion times that they DO collide with each other, since one has to spontaneously turn into a neutron....)
