Is the Object in this Photo Mars?

A little bit of context:
I dabble in amateur astronomy, however only very lightly. I originally wanted to make some observations of Mars because I know it is supposed to be very close these days but unfortunately in the Netherlands where I live we are having very bad weather. However, I think I spotted it today in the evening coming home (sadly I did not managed to get home quickly enough for a telescope/binoculars) and it was quickly gone behind clouds. However, I am not sure if it actually was Mars. It seemed too bright. My place is close to very active airport (Schiphol) and sometimes with just naked eye planes can look like celestial bodies (when they move away from me it looks like they don't move at all and I only had chance to look at the object for 2-3 min).
Information about Location & Object:
I took photo of the object with my phone (see below).
It was very bright - I recently (during summer) did some observations of Venus & Jupiter and this object outshined them both (although they were not visible today due to clouds so I am comparing it to my imperfect memory).
I immediately looked up my location on my phone: 52.294 N 4.879 E elevation 0 meters and the local time was 21:42 GMT+2.
The object was in the direction 110Â° East.
Now, I already looked it up and Mars should be in that direction, but I worry it might just have been a plane.
Furthermore, it looks like it is little bit too high. When I did observations of other planets in the past they were much lower in the sky. I know that the position changes due to Earth's rotation and orbit around the Sun, but I can't remember seeing them so high up and as far as I understand planets are all roughly around the ecliptic (although this was not place where I usually go stargazing so I might just be getting confused). Hence I would like to know, is the object in the picture Mars or we can't tell or it is something else?
