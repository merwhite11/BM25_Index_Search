Parent stars of our Sun - Where are its remains?

This is in a way related to this question.
Question is: Our star is third generation star, which is explained by existing Barium. That Barium was created by other stars. Now, those stars must have been Supernova. When they exploded, it was either a neutron star or a black hole.
Where is that Neutron star or black hole?
