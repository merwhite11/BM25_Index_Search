Very bright star in the east at northern hemisphere. What is it?

From some time now (few weeks as far as I can remember), there is a very bright star in the eastern sky. 
I first thought it was Venus, but according to this link, Venus is in the western sky and sets 2 hours after sunset. But this (very) bright star is still up even though it's midnight (6 hours after sunset).  
Does anyone know what is this star (or planet) ? 
Please excuse my silly question as I know nothing about astronomy. 
Thanks.
