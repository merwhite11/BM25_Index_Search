Why don't scientists believe Earth's surface water came up from the mantle?

I read, periodically, that there is more water trapped in the mantle than there is in the oceans - possibly a lot more.
If so, why don't any geologists believe that Earth's surface and near-surface waters were brought up via plate tectonics?
Why do they always claim it is a great mystery concerning the origins of Earth's oceans?
