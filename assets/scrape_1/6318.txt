Assuming a sufficient amount of mass above the density threshold, does the actual concentration of the mass matter in creating a black hole?

I've heard that the actual density of a black hole (within the volume of the event horizon) is pretty low - does that mean that any sufficiently large volume of mass over that density is also a black hole? Or does the actual concentration of mass within the event horizon matter?
Forked from "Is it possible that a ultra-large portion of the space we live in is already inside a black hole? How could we refute this?"
