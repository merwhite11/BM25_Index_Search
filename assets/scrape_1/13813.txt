How fast can and do gravitational waves travel?

I was thrilled by the recent announcement of the detection of gravitational waves. The media has done a great job explaining them and the theory behind them and I get the concept fairly well.
But if it's a warping of spacetime, not a particle phenomenon,  (or is it somehow?) How fast do these waves travel through space? Is it  constant or variable? Slower than the speed of light or even faster? If spacetime has no resistance per se, the what would keep them from traveling infinitely fast?
I'd love to understand it better and hope my question makes sense.
