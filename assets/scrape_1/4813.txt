What is the ratio of cosmic microwave background radiation to normal radiation?

I would like to know the ratio of cosmic microwave background radiation to normal radiation in the universe.  I am considering cosmic microwave background radiation to include the microwave, and any other radiation that is being emanated from near the "edge of the universe", while normal radiation is radiation emmitted by stars, nebulae, and other sources within the universe (excluding the cosmic microwave background).  Since we are in a galaxy, I know that the normal radiation here far exceeds the cosmic microwave background, but I am interested in the "average" value over the universe.  For example: total cosmic microwave background radation in the universe / total normal radiation in the universe.
