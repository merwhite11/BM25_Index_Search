Asteroids in langrangian Points 4 & 5

There are Asteroids "trapped" in Jupiters Langrange points 4 and 5 called trojans and greeks. Are there any asteroids in the earths L4 and L5? Have we seen asteroids in Lagrange points of the earth and moon system? Why are only L4 and L5 stable and L1, L2 and L3 require corrections to remain at those positions?
