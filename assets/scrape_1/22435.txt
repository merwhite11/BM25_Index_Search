Exactly how does Canis Minor look like a dog?

Here's what Canis Minor looks like.

To me, all I see is two stars. Canis Minor is a constellation of the giant Orion's hunting dog. Two stars can give quite a meaning. Two stars can mean a stick, a telescope, et cetera. But how could that be interpreted as a dog?
Since this is a Greek constellation, are there any sources that explain why ancient Greeks considered those two stars to represent a dog?
