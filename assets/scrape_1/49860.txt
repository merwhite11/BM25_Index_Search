Why doesn't dark matter clump strongly in the center of galaxies, since it doesn't feel either radiation pressure or the Pauli exclusion effect?

Dark matter is described as being spread not only throughout a galaxy, but also around it in a halo of some sort that extends far beyond the visible parts of the galaxy...
In fact, dark matter haloes are often described as being twice or more the diameter of the visible galaxy, with a slightly higher, not lower density, towards the outer edge, which is why they are called haloes, not spheres...
But if dark matter is not (necessarily) affected by the Pauli Exclusion Principle or radiation pressure, nor any other effect or force that might keep the alleged particles from cramming together due to gravity, why is it not much more heavily concentrated in the centers of large masses (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc.)?
