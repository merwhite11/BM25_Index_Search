How can we know the density of particles in interstellar or intergalactic space and could that density form dark matter?

It is assumed that the density of particles in the empty space between stars or galaxies is extremely low. But how do we know this density? The space surrounding the Sun is contaminated by cosmic radiation. Would a different value of this density alter what we see?
If that density were 10 times as large as expected could it account for dark matter? A galaxy contains a lot of mass but also a huge volume. If there is a higher density as expected wouldn't that make its gravity pull 10 times as strong? How big is the pull with the current density?
