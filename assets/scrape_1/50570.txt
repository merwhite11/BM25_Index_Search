Recommendation for green laser pointer for 6" Orion SkyQuest; one integrated with finder or a separate laser added to current configuration?

I would like to replace the default finder scope on my 6" Orion SkyQuest with one that incorporates a green laser.
Do such things exist, and if so, what should I look for in the laser specifications?
Would it be better to simply mount a laser pointer to my existing finder or the telescope?
