Do collisions of stars still undergoing fusion reactions produce gravitational waves?

When studying gravitational wave sources, we just consider BNS, NSBH, and BBH systems since their inspiraling and collisions can produce detectable graviational waves. Also according to the paper "The population of merging compact binaries inferred using gravitational waves through GWTC-3" the minimum mass for the components of the events observed is set as a prior condition of above 1 solar mass, that is, I am guessing we don't take into consideration the EM radiation of these bodies, so how do we know that the GWs produced and recorded by the detectors of LIGO/VIRGO are purely from NS and BH binaries? Can't massive stars (still undergoing fusion, that is, stars that haven't reached the end of their lifecycles) in inspiraling binaries produce GWs significant enough to be captured by the detectors and falsely be read as signals from NS and BH binaries? Or is this taken into account when a False Alarm Rate, FAR of <0.25 per year is taken (as taken in paper)?
