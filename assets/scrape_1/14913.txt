Has Science observed and recorded a stars birth?

Has Science observed the entire process of a star being created when the area of creation was just a void in space? Or is there still missing data that has not been entirely observed and recorded?  
I am asking for a simple yes or no if science has fully observed pre birth/Void in space and the entire birth of a star filling the void and what star was created.
Please no theory's only scientific fact with a reference thank you.
