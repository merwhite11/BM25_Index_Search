Would an object falling into a black hole ever collide with the surface of the black hole?

If an elephant jumped into a black hole would it ever splatter on the surface of the black hole? Or would it continue to fall indefinitely?
I think the elephant would continue to fall away from objects outside the black hole, while never reaching the surface of the black hole. The surface of the black hole, being the matter that originally created it, would be infinitely falling at a rate that would never allow the elephant to collide.
