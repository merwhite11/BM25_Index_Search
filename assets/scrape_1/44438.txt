What did Hawking mean when he said "things can get out of a black hole"?

I was wondering about this quote I read the other day, by Stephen Hawking:

"Black holes ain’t as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly come out in another universe.”

I know how Hawking Radiation works, so do the "Things can get out" refer exactly to the virtual particles? Or is this related to relativistic jets? I wanted to confirm my understanding of what he meant. Thanks.
