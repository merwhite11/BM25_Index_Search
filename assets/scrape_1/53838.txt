True masses of exoplanets from Gaia

At Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets#Space_telescopes it says "The Gaia mission, launched in December 2013, will use astrometry to determine the true masses of 1000 nearby exoplanets."
Ten years later, how is progress going in determining the true masses of nearby exoplanets?
