What parameters can we obtain from imagery of planets?

Looking at images for the planets of the solar system in all different wavelengths, I was wondering whether we can deduce any information about the planet itself without using anything other than an image.
An image of a planet is like the one for Jupiter on the Wikipedia page. Any info would be appreciated.
