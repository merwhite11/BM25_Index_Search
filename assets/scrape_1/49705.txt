Binoculars 10x50 in light polluted place

I think to buy cheap 10x50 binoculars for astronomy observations. My leaving area is light polluted, I can see only bright stars and planets in naked eye.
Will I can with this binoculars observe Saturn rings, Jupiter moons, Uranus and Neptune planets?
What deep space objects I can observe with this binoculars in light polluted area?
