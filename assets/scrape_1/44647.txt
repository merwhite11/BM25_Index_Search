What would I experience on a planet orbiting close to a black hole?

I can't get my head around it completely. I am standing on an Earth-sized planet circling a black hole. Let's assume the planet to be an incompressible one.
It is observable that matter is sucked in black holes from stars orbiting around them. At a certain distance though this will not happen anymore. The stuff of the star will stay within the star.
What will I feel on distances for which I will not be sucked in the hole? Will I just feel stretched out? Is this stretching gettting stronger up to the point I get sucked in (when the distance grows smaller)?
