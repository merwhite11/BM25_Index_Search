Using binoculars during solar eclipse totality

I'm hoping to see the April 2024 total eclipse (which would be my first), and am considering buying equipment to improve the view. Of course I'll have generic solar filter glasses, but I'm wondering if magnification would be helpful. (I'm not going to spend time on photography, as I don't want to be distracted from the experience, and there will be plenty of photos posted that are better than what I could produce.)
So, for those who have seen total eclipses: would binoculars give me a better view of totality? If so, what field width would cover the most interesting part of the corona?
Edit: I'm considering getting a pair of very-wide-angle binoculars, e.g. the Orion 2x54 Ultra Wide Angle Binoculars. Would that help with viewing the corona?
