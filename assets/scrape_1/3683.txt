Is it safer to be near a star or a black hole?

If a star or black hole neared the solar system, which would do the least damage?  For the sake of a good comparison, lets assume the candidate star is an "average" 5 solar mass star, and the black hole is a 5 solar mass black hole.  My thoughts at first were that the star would be the least devastating, but now that I think about it more, since not even radiation, etc... is being emitted by the black hole, (except possibly from hawking radiation and from any in falling matter), the black hole might actually be safer!
