How does gyrochronology deal with differential rotation and axial tilt?

K2 seems to become an even better mission than what a continuation of Kepler would have been, at least to some astronomers. By what means is differential star rotation being dealt with? The rotational period of the Sun is 45% longer at its poles than at its equator. Together with the unknown orientation of the star's rotational axis, can this really be sorted out from Doppler broadening of spectral lines? Is a star's rotational period defined as that of its equator or as some average across its surface?
