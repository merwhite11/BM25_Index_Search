How does 67P rotate?

What can be said about 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko axial tilt?
Is it fixed (if so, at what value), only changing with precession (at what rate?) or does 67P "tumble" with axial tilt changing over time? (and if so, at what rate?)
I'm interested in estimating the 'polar night' area of the comet, and how it changes over time - but without knowing the rotation properties this is quite hard to do.
