How to understand the charge of a black hole

How can I understand the charge of a black hole?
We can understand the charge of elementary particles, like the charge of a proton or neutron. But what does the charge of a big object like that of a black hole mean? A black hole will have so much stuff inside it. So will we add the charge of all the particles inside of a black hole to calculate the charge of a black hole as a whole? I know this sounds inappropriate, but I am very confused by the statement "Charge of a black hole". It would be very helpful if someone can clarify.
Note: There is a similar question, How can a black hole have a charge, or be charged?. I have gone through it, but I am not satisfied.
