What is a place to find raw numbers of sunspots from the past, as counted daily by sun observer?

What is a place to find raw numbers of sunspots from the past, as counted by sun observers ?
I have already visited 100+ of websites (NOAA, NASA, ESA, Japanese Institute ..)
and what is offered is calculated number of sunspots, Wolf number or modified Wolf number, still called sunspot number or raw number of spots.
I can get raw number of spots, as counted by observer from Royal Observatory Brussels, read from hand-made sketches, but one by one, not offered as a database txt or cms file.
I write short conference paper and get historic raw sunspot number counts from bulletines by Rudolf Wolf and others, as old as of the 1850 year.
It's ok, if you count sunspots and save your daily count to a file.
But today, counted numbers of sunspots by an individual observer, have been replaced by calculated sunspot indexes, called International Sunspot Number,  Estimated Sunspot Number, Wolf number.
I am sure, raw number of sunspots, as counted daily by an abserver, is saved and database is available somewhere on the internet, but I tried hard,  contacted many space weather scientists, researchers, contacted NASA, NOAA, ESA and still no success.
thank you
