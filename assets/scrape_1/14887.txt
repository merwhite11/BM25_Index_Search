Is there any proof of space being created?

Is there any proof for space being created?
Because I guess an explanation for the dark energy (dark = our understanding of it) could be that there is a gigantic amount of matter/dark matter that we cannot see (the gray clumps in the picture) that are attracting our matter (the known universe in the middle) => of course the universe is "expanding" with an acceleration. 
Am I talking non-sense?
