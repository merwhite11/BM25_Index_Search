What is the brightness and size of Jupiter from the Galilean moons, the closest moon, and the farthest moon?

From the Moon, Earth would appear 4 times larger than the Moon seen from Earth, and the magnitude of a "full earth" is around -17.
However, Jupiter from the Galilean moons appear much larger than the Earth from the Moon. What is the apparent magnitude and angular size of Jupiter from the Galilean moons and the closest / farthest moon?
