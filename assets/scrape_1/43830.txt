I saw a blinking light source, can someone explain it?

I was out watching the Perseids in the AM hours of August 11, 2018 from central Hungary. I brought my binoculars just in case I want to do regular stargazing. There was a blinking light directly overhead around Zeta Cephei. At first, I thought it was a tumbling satellite or debris, but:

It did not move anywhere. Even when observing with binoculars, it stayed in one spot, blinking like an airplane.
It was just 1 color (white).
The surrounding stars were not flashing.
This one wasn't particularly bright. The magnitude seemed randomized (with each blink).
There was a regular-ish pattern of 1-2 second intervals, best way to describe it is "digital", like a beacon, not a gradually fading brightness.

Things I'd rule out:

I'm sure this wasn't Twinkling (turbulent atmosphere), I know what that looks like.
If it were a balloon or a drone, it would have moved slightly.
If it were a geosynchronous satellite, it would have been on the celestial equator to the south (from my location), but they are so far away I doubt I could see them.

Eventually the blinking lost brightness and the object either disappeared or blended in with the non-blinking stars. I lost track where and which it was, alternating naked eye vs. binoculars. What do you think it was?
