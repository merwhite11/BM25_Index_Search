Which stars have I been seeing?

In the past mornings I have used to get out before sunrise for a stroll, to get some exercise while not meeting other people.
I live in Eindhoven (NL), and I get out of home at around 5:30 AM, when the Sun is not yet risen, the sky is just about to start getting brighter.
At about 30-40 degrees to the right from the rising Sun point, about 20 degrees above the horizon, I see a bright white star. 
About 5 degrees to the left of this star, I see two reddish objects, about 2 degree apart from each other, much more faint than the other star. 
Which stars are they? I have tried to find them in a sky map, but haven't been able to find anything resembling them.
