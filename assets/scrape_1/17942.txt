Function for current distance between in light-seconds between Mars and Earth

I'm looking for a function that given a time (for example Unix time) gives back the current distance between Mars and Earth in light-seconds.
It can be a mathematical function or programming function (preferably in Python or pseudocode), but must not rely on an Internet connection.
This question is similar to a question I asked erlier, but again I need to get the distance without an Internet connection.
Thanks in advance!
Sidenote: I'm planning on learning orbital mechanics, but I need this function earlier. :)
