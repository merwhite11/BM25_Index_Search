If the hypothesized planet behind the Kuiper belt existed, would it have a barycenter outside the Sun?

In 2016, an additional object rotating our Sun has been suggested. Assuming it has 5 Earth masses, would the planet or black hole proposed by Brown and Batigyn have a barycenter within the Sun or outside, or might it orbit the Sun-Jupiter barycenter, like Sedna?
