Why isn't IMBH candidate GW190521 very "chirpy"? Which types of events will produce the most chirp-like behavior?

The first gravitational wave observations were noted for their "chirp-like" behavior; the objects would speed up as they got closer, radiating more strongly and therefore loosing energy faster. An example of a "chirp" is shown below.
The new PRL GW190521: A Binary Black Hole Merger with a Total Mass of 150 M⊙ seems to show the first observation of the formation of an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). The image below doesn't seem to exhibit much chirpiness compared to lower-mass mergers. For example from  P. B. Abbott et al. (2016)

On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz...

Question: Why do some gravitational wave events chirp more than others? Which ones produce the best, longest, and most obvious chirp in frequency?
