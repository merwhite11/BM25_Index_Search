Is it possible for stars to not begin fusing hydrogen at all?

As far as I know, stars (virtually all stars) begin fusing hydrogen into helium, and the rest happens based on the mass and luminosity and etc.
Out of curiosity, I was wondering: is it even possible for a star to not begin with this hydrogen fusion at all - as in, fuse possibly another element - and still survive with an average-star lifespan?
Or, is is possible for a star to form out of an interstellar cloud containing insubstantial hydrogen?
