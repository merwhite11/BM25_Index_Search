What could these LMC objects in this color-color diagram be?

I have performed a color-color and colour-magnitude plot of various sources detected in an LMC image (JWST NIRCAM F200W, F150W and F115W filters). I then also queried SIMBAD to collect relevant photometric data (UBVRIJHKLMN system) on various stars of different spectral types. Moving between the 2 different filter systems was done via an initial estimate through the effective wavelength midpoints for which UBVRIJHKLMN system filters to use for each JWST filter, and then a regression through sets of standard stars to move as accurately as possible between the two filter systems. Plotting both sets of data creates the graph below - there is a clear trend for the SIMBAD data, but the LMC data simply doesn't follow it in the slightest. Any ideas of what these LMC objects might be?
