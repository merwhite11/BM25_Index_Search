Why can I see sometimes a horizontal half moon instead of a vertical one?

Why do I sometimes see a horizontal half moon, instead of the more usual vertical one? I keep getting answers for crescent moons, but this is a half moon with its curve closer to the horizon, like a bowl of cereal.
I would like to know why it only appears sometimes that way.
