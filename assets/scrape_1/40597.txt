What safety concerns should an amateur astronomer take?

I'm an amateur trying to take a shot at recreational stargazing. I've read about how looking a some eclipses without the appropriate instruments (i.e, with naked eyes) is bad for the eyes. To what extent is this true? Is staring at the phenomena bad or is even a quick glance dangerous?
Are there any more phenomena like eclipses I have to watch out for to protect myself?
