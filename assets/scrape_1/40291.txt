How long does it take for a white dwarf to undergo a type Ia supernova?

I read about white dwarfs and their relation to Type Ia supernovae, and I want to know how much time passes between when the white dwarf passes the Chandrasekhar limit and when the white dwarf explodes. So is there an exact value of this time, or does it vary between these events?
