Are there predictions of the distribution of matter at the end of time

Are there any theoretical predictions or "educated speculation" by cosmologists on how matter will be distributed at very, very distant times in the future?
For example, will matter be:

agglutinated into a big cold ball?
diluted across the universe in tiny bits?
large clusters of matter here and there?
something else?
