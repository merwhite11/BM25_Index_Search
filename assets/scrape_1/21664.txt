What was this red deep sky object?

I was looking through sky yesterday and saw something red in sky (naked eye ) like nebula or something then tried using stellarium and mobile observatory apps to find out what it was, But couldnt find anything like this in them. I also tried to capture it on my phone but nothing visible except brightest stars.
I just know it was in cygnus - vulpecula - sagitta or somewhere near it.
As i wear glasses and dont have access to dark sky, it was my first naked eye view of some sort of deep sky object. Ill become so happy if i find what that red object was.
