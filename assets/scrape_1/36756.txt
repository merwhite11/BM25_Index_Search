Can the Earth be used as a gravitational lens?

Could the Earth be used as a gravitational lens to image very far distances with an effective aperture that would be far greater than any telescope? How far away from Earth would an observing spacecraft have to get to enter the focal point, and see very far at a resolution? Would that enable the direct imaging of small planets around other stars?
