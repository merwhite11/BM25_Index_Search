'Very High Noon' - Sun directly overhead

Twice a year the sun is at a certain angle south (or north) of the equator between The Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn.
At that time the sun will be exactly overhead for people at the latitude (and longitude).
Is there a table or - better - a model that takes 
Latitude (and Year) as input
and responds with
Date, Time, and Longitude as output.?
-The 'closest' 'midday' (solar time) (before or after) will be the closest people at that latitude - round the world - will come to experience the sun 'directly' overhead.
You could call it 'Very High Noon'.
