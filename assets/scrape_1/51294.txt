A what distance could we see the Sun?

How far away can we see the Sun with the naked eye?
How far with an amateur telescope? And with the James Webb telescope?
In my own calculations the Sun would appear magnitude 6 at 56 ly, magnitude 8 (extreme naked eye limit) at 140 ly.
Wikipedia says that the limit magnitude for JWST is about 34 so at a distance of 22 million light years. Are my calculations right?
