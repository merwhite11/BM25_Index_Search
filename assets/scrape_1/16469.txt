What solar features would I see at 10x magnification?

I have a pair of binoculars with 10x magnification, 50mm objective diameter, and 6.5 degree (real) angular field of view.
I'm looking into buying solar filters for it (something like these) so I can view the sun. If I do so, will I be able to see most/many sunspots and planetary transits? Or is this simply not a powerful enough instrument to be worth investing in solar filters for it?
I like the idea of being able to check out the sun sometimes, but I don't know if I'm just getting way out of my league here and would need more complicated and expensive equipment to make it at all worthwhile. Thought I'd ask some experts before buying anything.
