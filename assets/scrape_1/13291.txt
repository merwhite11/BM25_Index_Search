How to watch at best this week's planet alignement?

I read somewhere that counting from today, five planets will be aligned during almost two weeks IIRC. The planets are : Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and... us. I know Jupiter and Mars can be seen with the naked eye, but I would really like to catch a glimpse of Saturn. 
Assuming one does not own a telescope, but small binoculars, how can one maximize his chances of seeing at least Mars, Jupiter and Saturn ?
