Drawing stars in a 3D space

I'm using the Galactic Coordinates to draw stars in a 3D space, but I don't know how to do it.
In the book "Practical Astronomy with your Calculator or Spreadsheet" I've found this:

Where:
S: the Sun.
G: the centre of the Galaxy.
X: a star which not lie in the galactic plane.
l: galactic longitude.
b: galactic latitude.
If I know S, G, l and b. How can I know the (x, y, z) coordinates of the star X?
Probably I need to know the distance between S and X.
