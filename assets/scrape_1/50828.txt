How was it established that central galaxy's supermassive black holes are responsible for existence of radio lobes?

According to Wikipedia:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_galaxy
"A giant radio galaxy is a special class of object characterized by the presence of radio lobes generated by relativistic jets powered by the central galaxy's supermassive black hole."
How it was established that the giant radio galaxy radio lobes are indeed generated by the relativistic jets powered by the central galaxy's supermassive black hole? Could by any chance there be other (than the effect of the central galaxy's supermassive black hole) alternative possible sources and/or phenomena, which could cause the presence of radio lobes in such giant radio galaxy?
