How many Milky Way stars in the Andromeda picture?

I am new to Astronomy, I got interested lately thanks to James Webb Space Telescope. I have some questions. In this zoomable picture of Andromeda galaxy, how many of our stars (Milky Way stars) in this picture? Are Milky Way stars those objects with spikes?
