Is Pluto a "proto-planet"?

My question is this : could the Charon-Pluto system becomes in the coming few millions years a full fledged planet, as in the IAU classification ?
I ask this because there are two facts that bother me : 

The system orbit isn't on the ecliptic
The system hasn't cleared its neighborhood

So, is it possible that that system isn't stabilized yet, and that 1) its orbit is very slowly changing (for lack of a better word) to the ecliptic, and 2) that the system will slowly collapse, and bring all its moons with it, to clear its neighborhood ?
In other words, is Pluto a "proto-planet" (as I would personally name it), or definitely (and for the next millions years) a dwarf planet ?
Edit : I disagree on the fact that this question is a duplicate of How long will it take Pluto to grow to planet size? as this one ask not for the size of Pluto, but rather the other characteristics, the orbit and the clearing the neighborhood.
Moreover, the question was asked in a broader canvas, to know if it was possible that some elements of the solar system (Pluto, but not only) could be instable enough to reach the level of planet sometime in the futur.
