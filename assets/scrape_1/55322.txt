Location of the big bang

If the big bang happened everywhere (as I always read when searching for an answer to "where is the universe expanding from") then we would see galaxies moving not just in an expanding fashion but everywhere, i.e. galaxies moving from/to all directions including but not limited to head on crash courses.
Out of what I understood so far (not an astronomer) either the universe is expanding like expansion means, growing from a center place, or galaxies move from/to everywhere, therefore, i.e. not expanding, from what I understand these answers are mutually exclusive.
Please explain like I'm 5 (again: Not an astronomer here, just curious) what I'm missing here.
