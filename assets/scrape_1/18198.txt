What suggests the cyclic nature of the universe? Proposed by Stephen Hawking

In "A Briefer History of Time" by Stephen Hawking he writes that if we were to travel faster than the universe were expanding and for long enough (in a straight line) we would eventually come back to the point we started.
What suggests that the universe is cyclic in nature as this suggests?
Or what led him to come to this conclusion?
