If I was in a coma and woke up at night in the desert, what knowledge would I know instantly and after 30 days?

If I was in a coma and woke up at night in the desert, what knowledge would I know instantly and after 30 days of observation?

Can I figure out  the general directions, i.e. where North, South, East, and West is?
Can I conclude my exact or approximate location on the world map?
Can I know the current season?

And during day time: If I draw the arc path of the sun from rise to sunset for a longer period of time - what info can I infer from it?
