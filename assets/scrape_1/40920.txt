What is the mean separation between a star and its closest neighbor in the Milky Way halo?

My question is inspired by this previous question, Are there any stars that orbit perpendicular to the Milky Way's galactic plane?. In the great answer posted by @ConnorGarcia, one commenter said he would be really jealous of anybody that could see the view of the Milky Way from close to the galactic poles, since a star stream passes close to them. I think, on the flip side, they would envy us due to their near complete isolation. Space travel outside their home system would be much harder, for example. Here on the galactic plane, near the Sun, I guess the average distance to the closest nighboring star is about ~10 Ly or less. The Alpha Centauri system is about 4 Ly away, for example. Regarding the galactic halo, I guess if we picked a random star there, its closest neighbor would be probably located > 100 Ly away. Is this estimate reasonable? Are there reliable figures on that?
