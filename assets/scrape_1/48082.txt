What are some astrophotography editing options and strategies for taking photos of galaxies with a telescope and a cell phone?

We purchased a phone adapter for my sons telescope and got some amazing pictures, BUT we believe that they can be clearer.
What is the best, or a really good, image editing program for amateur astrophotography images; especially those taken with a telescope + cell phone combination?
What kinds of functions should we be looking for in this case?
