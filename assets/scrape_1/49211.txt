How time-symmetric is orbital mechanics?

Kepler's first two laws tell us that in a two body orbit in which one of the bodies is much more massive than the other, that:

The smaller body orbiting the larger body has an orbital path that
traces an ellipse.
A segment between the two bodies sweeps out equal
area in equal time.

Given these simplifications, it appears that such an orbit is time-symmetric.  That is, an orbit propagator that predicts the future orbit could also reproduce the prior orbit if we input a position with negative orbital velocity.
Is this also true for simplified parabolic and hyperbolic orbits?
How about for n-body orbital simulations? It can't be true for mutually orbiting black holes which radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves and eventually merge, can it?
Which leads me to the question: Just how time-symmetric is orbital mechanics?
