What is the maximum number of planets in the habitable zone?

At present, it seems like we are alone in our solar system. How many earth-like planets would fit into the habitable zone of the solar system? 
The orbits should be stable for quite a time, i.e. for life to evolve, let's say 4.6 billion years.
The habitable zone may be estimated from 0.725 to 3.0 astronomical units, according to Wiki.
Could one use perturbation theory to answer this?
