Are all models of ocean planets theoretically cloud covered?

Take for example an ocean planet slightly smaller than the Earth. Let's say it has a planet-wide ocean that is on the average 10 miles deep. Say for argument sake, that there is a molten, rotating outer core producing a magnetic field and that there are plate tectonics (although not to the same degree as Earth). Also, imagine that there are volcanoes that reach as high as 5 miles below sea level. The planet's effective temperature is similar to Earth (not counting greenhouse). Would such a world without land always be covered with clouds? Would it necessarily have a runaway greenhouse? How about such a world with no vulcanism?
