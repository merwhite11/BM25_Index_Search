Can I do M.Sc in physics to become an astronomer after doing B.Tech in aeronautical engineering?

I am a student of class 12 and I am studying in India. I want to be an astronomer and I know that I have to get a B.Sc, then M.Sc, and then Ph.D in astronomy. I have also started to learn the python programming language. I came to know that there are less opportunities for research in astronomy, since many organizations like ISRO not only employ scientists, but also employ engineers to make satellites and spacecrafts. I will try my best to become an astronomer, but to have life security (if i am unemployed), can I do aeronautical engineering so that I can even get employed in ISRO? After having a degree in engineering and after doing engineering can i do M.Sc in physics and then i start preparing to be an astronomer?
Let me tell you about myself a bit, I love to study science and I love to learn about stars (I have also watched documentaries on astronomy like "How the universe works" and "Cosmos"). I also love aircraft so aeronautical engineering would also be a job that I would love. And please tell me should I also do some extra courses which would enhance my skills as an astronomer?
