Dark energy affecting the ejection and infall of material in galaxies?

Some galaxies have active outflows of material (mostly gas) that would eventually stop at some distance and then fall again into the galaxy due to gravitational attraction.
However, can dark energy influence this mechanism so that in the outflow the material would fall again towards the galaxy but a greater distance than it would without dark energy?
