Why is the composition of the sun so distinct from that of earth?

Given that the sun is – in astronomical distances – quite close to the earth, why are the two composed of such distinctly different substances?
Sun Composition

Hydrogen 74.9%
Helium 23.8%
Oxygen ~1%
Carbon 0.3%
Others <1%

Earth Composition

Iron 32.1%
Oxygen 30.1%
Silicon 15.1%
Magnesium 13.9%
Sulfur 2.9%
Nickel 1.8%
Calcium 1.5%
Aluminum 1.4%
Other 1.2%

A couple things I notice. The sun is quite homogenous compared to earth! It is mostly composed of just two elements whereas on earth no single element makes up more than 32% of the planet's mass.
Also, there is extremely little overlap in the elements: hydrogen and helium are the only game in town on the sun, but are nearly nonexistent on earth.
This makes me very curious! What aspect of the process of the formation of the solar system was responsible for essentially segregating these elements? Is it simply that the heavier elements were "burned" away in the hotter environment of the sun, or is there some other explanation?
