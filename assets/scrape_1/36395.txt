What would happen if you jumped out of a moving spacecraft?

I've watched a film where one of the characters claimed to have rapidly disembarked a moving spacecraft during a 5g burn (?!) and immediately wondered how he survived.
For example, you're on a spacecraft that's travelling at 100mph (or any other random speed) and you go to the nearest airlock and jump out (I.E: leave the spacecraft).
Assuming you have a strong enough protective suit (I.E: this isn't a murder/suicide):

What effect does this have on your body?
Does the vacuum of space mitigate or exacerbate the negative effects?
Will you just "float out" into space or will you actually be moving with/in the general direction of the spacecraft?
Do you slow down or speed up relative to the spacecraft?
How do the effects change as the speed changes?

I apologise for the multi-part question, but this question can't really be summarised in a single sentence.
UPDATE: Also, has this ever happened before? Has anyone ever "fallen out" of a spacecraft and made it back safely?
Thank you.
