Did I see a meteor or a re-entry?

Last night (January 21, 2015, possibly 5:30 UTC), from my house in northern California, I saw a moving point of light in the sky, going west to east, crossing about 120 degrees of sky in 5 seconds or so.
It didn't look like my experience of meteors - thicker and slower, and quite bright. I think it survived until it was out of sight entirely, rather than burning out.
Aerospace.org's reentry predictions doesn't show anything for that time.
I've seen ISS and other satellites; this was a lot larger and brighter, and my favorite satellite pass schedule also shows nothing.
Was this more likely a rocket body re-entry, or a large meteor?
