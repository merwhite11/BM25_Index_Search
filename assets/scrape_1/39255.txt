What instruments are used to measure the distance to the Sun?

In the 18th century, the distance to the Sun was measured using the transits of Venus. Nowadays, the timing of radar pulses is used to measure the distance of things in our solar system. What instruments are used to perform these measurement? What do they look like (bonus points for pictures)? Are there observatories with "radar guns" dedicated to measuring the distance of the Sun?
