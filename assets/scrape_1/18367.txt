How is a day measured on a gas giant?

After watching this JPL video of a Cassini time lapse of Saturn, I wondered since being mostly gases, how do we know how long a day—one rotation period—is?
Is there a usable relation between how fast the upper most layer of gases is and the planet's solid core?
