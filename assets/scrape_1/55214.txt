Why did Theia create only one moon if it struck Earth?

If I dropped a heavy ball into some magma it would splash all over the place.  So why would Theia create only one large drop of liquid (the moon) and if it impacted the Earths mantle (Bits of Theia might be in Earth's Mantle)?
What did it do to the Earth's core?
