How do I estimate the number of neutron stars and black holes relative to the number of stars in the main sequence and white dwarfs?

Recently, I had a homework question that gave me the mass of a main-sequence star, that is, M_tp = 0.9 M_solar, and the population formed at the same time. I am supposed to use the stellar birth function to help determine the answer. However, I still have no idea how to approach this. Can someone explain how someone would approach this question?
