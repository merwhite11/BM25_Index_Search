Definition of stellar core?

This is a basic question, but I may as well ask it. I had always thought that the core of a main-sequence star is defined as the part hot enough for nuclear fusion. Some dictionaries seem to agree with this.
However, many books say that protostars and pre-main-sequence stars also have cores, though they are not undergoing hydrogen fusion.
So what exactly is the definition of a stellar core? If it doesn't necessarily have to be hot enough for fusion, what separates it from the rest of the star?
