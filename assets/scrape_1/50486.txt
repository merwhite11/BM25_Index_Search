What happened to Titan's magnetic field?

From Wikipedia - Titan's atmosphere:

Titan's internal magnetic field is negligible, and perhaps even nonexistent, although studies in 2008 showed that Titan retains remnants of Saturn's magnetic field on the brief occasions when it passes outside Saturn's magnetosphere and is directly exposed to the solar wind.

Why is this so? Is it due to it being inside Saturn's magnetic field? Or something else?
