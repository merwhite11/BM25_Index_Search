How can we hear the sound of the Sun?

Recently NASA has revealed that they have recorded the sound of Sun. They say that it produces a sound like "Om". I can't understand how they can hear it. 
To the best of my knowledge, sound can't travel in space (vacuum). Has a new technique been invented that enables them to detect sound coming from outer space? If so, what is it? How does it work?
