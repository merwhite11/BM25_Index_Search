Is there a common metric to measure telescope power?

It is rather hard for me to compare telescopes due to the various numbers used.
600mm focal length and a 50mm diameter and eyepiece is a 12mm.
VS.
Focal length of 500 mm and the objective diameter is about 90 mm, Using a 3x Barlow Lens.
Is there something like an APR for telescopes?  Is there any objective rating system?  Most of the review videos just sound like sales pitches.
