What were the two bright dots that showed up near Jupiter and vanished after seconds?

I saw two bright lights near Jupiter and I’m pretty sure that it wasn’t just an airplane. It had almost the same level of brightness as Jupiter, and I was wondering what it could be. Can anyone explain me what it was?
