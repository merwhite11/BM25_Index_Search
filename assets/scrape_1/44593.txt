What discoveries were made thanks to Pioneer orbiter data?

Based on the Wikipedia page Pioneer Venus Orbiter (also known as Pioneer Venus 1, Pioneer 12, 1978-051A) there were quite a few scientific instruments on board. But what scientific results were extracted from the data collected? What did we discover about Venus with Pioneer?

Note: I hesitated to post this question on the Space Exploration Stackexchange, but since the question is about the characteristics of Venus and the science done with the probe, but not about the probe itself, I figured it was a better fit for this site.
