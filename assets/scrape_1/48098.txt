Are older main-sequence stars found in or near molecular clouds?

From what I have read as molecular clouds are the birth place of stars, their population as you would assume are young stars or stellar remnants but so far I have not found out if there are main-sequence stars of the age of ours or older that have either wandered into a molecular cloud or are positioned close by.
I was wondering if we have observed any solar systems similar to the age of ours or older within or close to molecular clouds?
