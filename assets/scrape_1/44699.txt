Can the pebbles growth model be applied to the rotations of planetary systems?

I've just read the University of Amsterdam 2019 News item Pebbles determine the direction in which planets rotate (which links to R.G.Visser et al (2020) Spinning up planetary bodies by pebble accretion Icarus 335 (1) January 2020, 113380)
According to the news item, the pebbles growth model can be used for the rotational state of the solar system. It explains why all planets rotate in the same direction (except Venus).
Can the same theory be applied to the directions of rotations of planetary systems in the Milky Way? That is the rotation directions of the planets around stars?
Are the planes of planetary orbits all parallel? That is, do the all lay in the galactic plane?
