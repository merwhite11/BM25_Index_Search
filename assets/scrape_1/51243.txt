How far are we from a black hole?

As far as I know, the closest (object reasonably believed to be a) black hole to Earth is Gaia BH1 at ~1560 ly. But presumably most black holes are hard to detect and there are undiscovered black holes closer. Knowing what we know about the IMF and stellar evolution, how close can we reasonably expect to be to some black hole?
