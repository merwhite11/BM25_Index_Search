Which is the most early type star with a planet discovered by radial velocity method?

We have discovered planets in  Beta_Pictoris(A6V)here and Fomalhaut alpha(A3v)here. 
However they were discovered by direct images.
There should be an stellar type limit by RV?  
What is the most early type ever found?
