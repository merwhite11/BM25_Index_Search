How did Batygin estimate when Planet Nine was ejected?

Konstantin Batygin has estimated that if Planet Nine was ejected, it would have been ejected 3-10 million years after the formation of the Solar System.
I'm curious as to how he arrived at this figure. Was it through simulations of the early Solar System, a prediction of the alignments of orbits at that time, or something completely different?
