Is Barnard's star an M4 red dwarf or an M0? Why is it called an M4.0V?

I have tried to figure this out, but cannot find an answer anywhere...
Are, perhaps, astronomers unsure of its exact spectral class?  (I have heard that red dwarfs are usually variable... to an extent...)
Books and articles talk about M0 stars, M0V, and M4, but not M4.0V...
