Blue, red, and white star?

At 6:30pm central time in the USA I saw a rapidly twinkling red blue and white star in the sky. It was about south east and I was really confused. I looked it up it might be Sirius but I'm not sure. I know it's not an airplane cause it hasn't moved in 20 minutes. Does anyone know?
