Is life (as we know it) even possible around M-class stars?

My Question is about the fascination in looking for life on M class or Red Dwarf stars.
We all know that Most stars (70%) are M Class, so looking at those stars is going to be important. The "Habitable" zone around a Red Dwarf is very close to the star, and Red Dwarfs are still very active in terms of solar flares. Being that close the star and getting caught in a solar event seems like it would be more of a rule than just an accident.
We live on a world with a fairly stable sun and a robust Magnetosphere, and are far enough away that the damage can be mitigated, but still we have had some issues with it. When you are that close to an active sun, it seems to me, that any life that might have made a foothold would be killed off anytime the sun had a bad day. Even if you were lucky enough to not have your atmosphere be blown off, the radiation would destroy any life that might have started.
It's entirely possible that I am missing some major idea or explanation. In fact I hope that I am.  I understand that we want it to be a possibility since most of the galaxy is M Class stars and that making them viable is preferable, but I could never get my mind around it. Is it just wishful thinking or am I missing something huge?
It's a serious question, and I hope you will take it as such. Is looking for life on an M Class star just wishful thinking, because it makes the chances of finding life out there so much less daunting?
