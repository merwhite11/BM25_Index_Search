Can I ever reach the singularity in a black hole?

Let us say hypothetically that I am able to survive a fall down a black hole. Now, time dilation exists with respect to the external observer (if I am not mistaken) such that I appear to slow down as I approaches the event horizon to the external observer, taking an infinite time to reach it. And so as I fall down, won't the time in the universe be accelerating at an infinite pace if I ever reach the singularity? (which could not be possible[?] as the universe might disintegrate at some point of time). So is reaching the singularity(if it exists at all) even possible?
