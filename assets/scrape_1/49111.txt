Projection from Earth

If a Particle is projected from Equator due north with a velocity $v$ and Earth is rotating with a uniform angular velocity $\omega$.
How can it be shown that the highest latitude reached will be given by the following expression? \begin{equation}
\frac{\pi}{2}-(\pi-2) \frac{\omega R}{v}
\end{equation}
