Does the Moon Have Enough Water for Robert Zubrin's Mars settlement Plan To Work?

In Robert Zubrin's "The Case for Mars" he outlines a plan to settle Mars by(among other things) finding water and using electrolysis to break up water into Hydrogen and Oxygen. This provides fuel for vehicles and air for the crew to breathe. Can a similar plan work to settle the moon? Are there enough resources on the moon for a settlement to be self-sufficent? Is there enough water on the moon for this to be viable?
