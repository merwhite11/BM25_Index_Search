Why do some solar eclipses' umbra cross arctic/antarctic regions?

The ecliptic (Earth's orbital plane) is inclined 23.4 degrees. This is the same as Earth's axial tilt. The Moon's orbit is inclined 5.145 degrees to the ecliptic.
Therefore, the maximum latitude where a solar eclipse produces an umbra should be 28.545 N and 28.545 S.
But this is clearly not the case. Wikipedia has a huge list of solar eclipses with charts. Here's one that goes very near the south pole. How is this possible?
Edit: Actually I missed something. Since the Moon and Sun must be in the same place, and the Sun can never exceed 23.4 degrees declination, solar eclipses must be bound by 23.4 N/S. I should not have added the two angles. Thanks to user:berrycenter for pointing it out.
