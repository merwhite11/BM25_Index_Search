Does the universe prefer a velocity?

As I understand it, the distribution of matter is roughly homogeneous across space -- anywhere I stand in the universe, there will about the same amount of matter in every direction around me.
Is the distribution of matter across velocities roughly homogeneous?  If I flew away from the center of the Milky Way at .999c, would all directions look roughly the same, or would I notice a wind of galaxies and neutrinos traveling at a preferred velocity?
