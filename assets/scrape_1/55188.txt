Did anything happen to "hubble-class" telescopes military gifted to NASA in 2012?

I stumbled onto this news article from 2012 discussing NRO (national reconnaissance office) giving its surplus unlaunched spy satellites over to NASA (with a lot of caveats)
It's been 11 years since that point, so I'm wondering if anything has been done with that.

I remember there was a mission not that long ago that has been prohibited from looking at Earth to not reveal some spy optics quality - is that connected?
