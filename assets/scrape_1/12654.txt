Ejected planets during the early stages of the formation of the Solar System

This is similar to a previously asked question, but I am just asking about theory rather than observational evidence. Assuming there were a much larger number of protoplanets in the early Solar System, what percentage of these would theoretically have been ejected (orbital velocity increased beyond escape velocity due to interaction) and what percentage would have been just moved out to a more distant orbit (say, in the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud)?
In other words, should we expect to find rocky worlds in the far outer Solar System that were formed inside the current radius of the asteroid belt?
