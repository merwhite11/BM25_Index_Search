Is it possible to observe strong gravitational lensing with amateur telescopes?

Strong gravitational lens systems like the Cosmic Horseshoe have been imaged by scientific space telescopes, but have any amateur astronomers accomplished this?
Or are amateur/small ground based telescopes not suited for this?
