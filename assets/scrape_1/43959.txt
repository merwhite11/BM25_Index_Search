If months are based on the moon, then why are the months longer in the Gregorian calendar than lunation?

What I have always thought / known is that:
Days are based on the period of rotation of the earth.
Months are based on the moon.
Year is the time taken by the earth to make one revolution around the sun.
But if we take a look at the lunation it takes on average 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 28 seconds. Why is it that the months then in the Gregorian calendar have 28-29 / 30 / 31 days?
