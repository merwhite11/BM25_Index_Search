Can some stars not emit any energy in the visible spectrum?

Stars convert mass into energy. Even converting the slightest mass into energy is immense because the speed of light is so great and $E = mc^2$. This means that stars have to emit large amounts of energy. So can they emit so much energy in a form of electromagnetic radiation that is not visible light? Resulting in a star that cannot be detected using our senses(+ a telescope). If so what problems could this star pose?
