Effect of Hot/Warm Jupiter atmosphere loss on other planets

Let us suppose a solar system with a Hot/Warm Jupiter HJ (with a semi-major axis somewhere from 0.5 AU to 0.0001 AU) and an Earth-Like planet EL in it (with a semi-major axis of about 1 AU). Let their orbital inclinations be a couple of degrees apart. Let the star be a G2V or so, like our Sun.
According to this and other sources, we can tell that Hot Jupiters are "bleeding" atmosphere due to their proximity to their sun. Some of it, I presume, gets pushed out with the solar wind farther out into the solar system, at least as far as the EL is.

What effect will this bled atmosphere from HJ have on EL, if any?
If there is an effect, when does it happen? On all of EL's orbit, despite the different inclinations? Only when EL crosses a transit node? Only when there's a transit (or rather, when EL passes through the transit node a certain amount of time after HJ does, to account for the velocity of the atmospheric particles through space)?
Will this bled atmosphere be (naked-eye) visible from EL? What would it look like?
Would all of this have any effect on life/civilization on the EL?
