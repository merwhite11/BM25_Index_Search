space programs/projects/competitions/courses ..etc?

My name is Meryem (or Meer), I'm 15 years old and I've been fond of space and astronomy since two years.
I read books about astronomy, love to search and write reviews about astronomy topics and sometimes I share them with some people.
I really want to make achievements and do activities related to astronomy, but I can't because my country's environment here doesn't support those space activities, so I came here to ask if you know such as space course or a space program which gives students around the world an opportunity to take part in it, or something like that..
or even if you know the right people to ask them about these stuff, tell me.
Thanks.
