How do I know that Iâ€™ve found Neptune?

So, recently I went out for a look at Neptune with my telescope and I found the general area of where Neptune was. However, when I took a see for myself, there were a ton of blue stars everywhere and I had a really hard time deciphering which one was actually Neptune, because along with all the other stars, Neptune is blue too and it blends in easily with the rest. How do I know which is the blue planet?
