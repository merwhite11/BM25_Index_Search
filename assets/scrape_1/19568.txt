Celestron Astromaster 114eq Star pointer finder scope help required

Just got a Celestron Astromaster 114eq as a christmas present and I have tried setting up the Star Pointer in the daylight. I did not use the red dot method as in the instruction manual, instead, I tried to do this by viewing a object through the main scope (placing the object in the center of the main scope) and then I made some slight adjustments to the Star Pointer finder scope aligning both circle and dots on the finder scope using the two adjustment screws.
This seems to work fine and finds the targets quite well,but when it turns dark and I turn on the the red dot in the finder scope and aim at a star I have yet to manage to focus in on it. Should the method I used to set up the scope finder or do I need to set up the scope finder in the dark?
Any help would be appreciated.
