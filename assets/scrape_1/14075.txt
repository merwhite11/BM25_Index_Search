Why aren't planet orbits circular?

Please forgive the simplicity of my question.  I have only had basic science courses.  Common sense seems to indicate that planetary orbits should be very close to circular, any perturbations having been eliminated over the ages.  Could it be that the composition of the planet be influencing the pull of gravity to produce a different gravitational attraction due to its mass?  I mean that if a planet were composed all of one substance, would the planetary orbit be perfectly circular?  I think about earth having constantly shifting water and gasses and even solids that affect its own rotation.  Might these shifts also affect the orbit of the planet around the sun, or does the total mass of the earth and moon together determine the orbit?
