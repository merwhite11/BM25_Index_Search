Obtaining the Flux-Time plot for a Quasar

As a follow up question to Obtaining the Light curve of a a Quasar, I wish to know how to obtain a Light curve for a quasar observation like this data set over here.
Is there an archival repository where I can find processed csvs of quasar observations like these for a testing of a particular theory that i need to carry out. Thanks!
