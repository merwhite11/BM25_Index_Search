Would an object placed at L1 be seen in front of the Sun from Earth?

Does anything placed at the Lagrangian point L1 between the Earth and Sun obscure the Sun like a transit of the innermore planets? The James Webb telescope is to be placed at L2, but if it was placed at L1, would it be in front of the Sun when looked upon from Earth? When you looked from the equator into the Sun, the telescope would be in the very center of the solar disc, right?
