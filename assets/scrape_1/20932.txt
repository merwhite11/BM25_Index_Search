Is it coincidence that Einstein predicted exactly twice the outcome of Newton for the gravitational deflection of light?

During a solar eclipse Sir Arthur Eddington measured the deflection of star light by the Sun. Einstein predicted a deflection of 1.74 arc seconds, but according to Newton the deflection should have been 0.86 arc seconds. So is it a coincidence that the prediction of Einstein is twice as large or is there a kind of law involved which makes Einstein's outcome of his GR twice as big as that according to Newton?
