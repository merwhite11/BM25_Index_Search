What about the U planet?

In 2014 and 15, an object called U has been detected by the ALMA in Chile, considered likely to be a super-Earth at 300 AU, among other options. Is it located where the hypothetical super-Earth supposedly responsible for ETNO's orbits is believed to be? Has there been any progress since 2015 in finding out what the U object is?
