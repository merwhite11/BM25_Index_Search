Procedure to construct a spectral energy distribution and bolometric light curve of supernovae?

Can anyone check the logic of this proposed workflow and/or point me in the direction of a guide and example to check my work?
Proposed procedure to construct a spectral energy distribution and bolometric light curve of supernovae:

Correct magnitude values for extinction (galactic and host)
Convert magnitude to flux
Plot flux against wavelength
Integrate the SED over the wavelength range as a Planck function
