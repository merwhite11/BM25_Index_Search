How are neutrinos produced in blazar jets?

I was watching the press release about measuring neutrinos and gamma rays from a distant blazar. One of the presenters mentioned that the neutrinos are associated with very high energy protons caught up in the jet produced by the galactic nucleus. What I don't understand is what interation(s) is producing the neutrinos in this scenario. What sort of particles must the protons be interacting with to produce these neutrinos?
