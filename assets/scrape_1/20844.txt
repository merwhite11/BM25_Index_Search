How strong is the gravity from half of the distant universe?

I would like to know, how strong would the gravity be from the distant universe if we were somehow able to remove half of it.  For example, if everything behind us did not exist, how strongly would the stuff in front of us be pulling?  By distant, let us consider everything beyond 10 billion light years (e.g. remove all the closer stuff).  How many G's acceleration would I experience (discounting the fact that I would be in free fall and wouldn't feel it)?
