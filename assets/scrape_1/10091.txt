Why is there so much methane in space?

In school I learned that methane is organic matter and that it is a possible product of crude oil refinement. However, recently I read that Uranus has huge methane storms and the Saturn moon Titan even has lakes consisting only of methane or ethane. 
Now, I'm wondering, how does all that methane get out there? 
Is it the result of organic processes or is it created in the cores of suns like other elements? Do we even know?
Methane is also a pretty complex material. Do we know sources of more complex molecules other than methane in such quantities? Except life on earth?
