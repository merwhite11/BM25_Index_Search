How do astrophysicists handle the topic 'boundaries'?

The naive perception, at least mine, is that in astrophysics the objects of investigation evolve in an infinitely large environment. Since the scenery is so much larger than the events unfolding in it, astrophysicists should never have to take into account that the universe may have walls/envelopes/surfaces limiting the going of things. I wondered to which extent this vision is naive.
How do astrophysicists handle the topic of 'boundaries' in space? 
This is a very general, open, `soft' question, almost philosophical. Handle is a jolly word to mean think of, take into account, represent, model, simulate, even avoid, and so on and so forth.
Clearly I am neither an astronomer nor an astrophysicist.
