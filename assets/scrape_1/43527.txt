Is Cosmic Ray Astronomy a thing?

Historically astronomy has been the regime of visible light, looking at distant objects in the visible spectrum and later taking photographs in the visible spectrum.
In the past century radio astronomy, infrared astronomy and exploring other bands in the electromagnetic spectrum became feasible.
Over the past decade we have been able to begin doing neutrino astronomy, identifying distant neutrino sources.
Is there any reason that this cannot progress to other particles, I.E. general cosmic ray astronomy?
One could consider a specialized telescope (it would need to be in a satellite) that detects muons only and forms images from muon detection, or perhaps a proton telescope. The idea being to map incoming particles to pixels in an image, and assign a brightness depending on frequency of particles.
