What is the wiggle in the AGB branch?

In many HR diagrams, the asymptotic giant branch includes a wiggle. I thought that these are thermal pulses, but now I realise there are many thermal pulses, and I find only one wiggle. The wiggle could be dredge-ups, but there could be more dredge-ups, as there are way more than one thermal pulses.
