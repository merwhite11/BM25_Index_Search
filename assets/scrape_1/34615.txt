DSO in a 60mm telescope

I am thinking about buying a telescope, but here in Brazil they are very expensive and hard to find where to buy. So, the better telescope I can pay for is a Celestron Powerseeker 60AZ. My main application would be to see nebulas and some star clusters, but I don't know if this scope can be used for this pourpose. Will I see big blurry images, faint lights (like a tiny fog on the darkness of the sky) or only its main stars?
*Note: I've found some images about planets in small scopes on YT, but I haven't found about DSOs (although, I know the images won't be so atractive like bigger telescope ones). Also, can I use the star diagonal as a barlow lens?
