A day in earth, a thousand years somewhere else

By followig the laws of physics, is it possible, that in a place far far away that one day (at that place), is counted as 1000 years in the earth.
I am familiar with black holes having impact on time. But would it be possible without black holes and such,
I think i've heard that the gravity has impact with the time too?
