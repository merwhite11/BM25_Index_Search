Is there a clear-cut difference between rocky and gaseous planets?

A gas giant planet is large enough that it retains a lot of hydrogen and helium. A rocky planet is one with a solid surface. That's the rule of thumb to distinguish between the rocky and gaseous planets. 
But gaseous planets can have a solid core and rocky planets can have a very thick atmosphere. So is there a clear-cut difference between the two categories of planets (perhaps linked to different formation histories), or is there a continuum of planets that goes from more rocky to more gaseous? If it's a continuum, where is the limit set between the two types?
