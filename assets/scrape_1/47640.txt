Why is the Emissivity of emission lines in unit erg.s-1.cm3?

The python package PyNeb could calculate the 'Emissivity' of an emission line at given electron temperature and density in unit "erg.s-1.cm3". But I don't know why Emissivity should in such an unit but not "erg.s-1.cm-3", what does this unit mean?
