How can Bond Albedo be greater than Geometric Albedo?

Have gathered from papers like this one (*) that "Albedo is differentiated into two general types: (1) normal, reflective or geometric albedo, and (2) bond albedo". The document explained that Geometric Albedo usually is bigger than the Bond Albedo, which often just reflects two-thirds of the reflective light of Geometric Albedo.
Wikipedia points out in this article about Bond Albedo; that Bond Albedo sometimes  can be greater than Geometric Albedo, which apparently is the case with Venus and Mars.
Question is; How Is this possible? What is behind this phenomenon? I think Wikipedia is trying to explain it, but I have difficulty grasping it. Can it be explained in an easier way? Examples with pictures would be ideal.
