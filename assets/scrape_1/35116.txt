How many members of the IAU typically attend votes?

One of the talking points of people how think that the definition of a planet should include Pluto is that during the 2006 vote on the definition of a planet, only a small percentage of the members of the IAU actually voted (183 for, 186 against. 13116 total members), thus making the results of the vote not representative of a consensus among the astronomical community. 
Where the number of members who voted that motion uncharacteristically low, compared to most votes taken by the IAU? Does this low number of voters indicate that this decision is not representative of what astronomers working on this issue think?
