What makes the planets to be symmetric

I have seen, in my text books, and on nasa sites, the all the planets are symmetrical. And universe also love symmetry. What cause this symmetry, why the symmetry is important. 
As we know that universe is expanding day by day. Will the symmetry will change. I am a high school boy, and happy to have an answer on it. 
Edit:) we do not know where is the limit between quantum behavior and classical behavior. Can we put the local asymmetry of the universe on the quantum randomness? To be specific, the fact that looking in one direction we see the constellation Centaurus, and in another direction the constellation Lyra, can be put on quantum randomness?
