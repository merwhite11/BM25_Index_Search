Why are there no ISM clouds with temperatures between 100 and 6,000K?

In the interstellar medium, there are several different diffuse phases of gas, distinguished by their density and temperature. Specifically, the cold neutral medium has temperatures from ~50-100 K and the warm neutral medium ranges from 6,000-10,000 K. According to my professor, there have been few gas clouds found with temperatures between these two.
Does anyone know why such a large gap exists?
