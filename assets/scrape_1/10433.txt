Where to obtain Tycho Brahe's data?

I would like to obtain Tycho Brahe's data on Mars. What would be an authoritative source? One source I could find is this page (the data is given as an Excel file) but I have no idea can that be trusted. Does some astronomical organization or university keep the data public? I suppose Tycho wrote his data into a book. Where is that book located at the moment?
