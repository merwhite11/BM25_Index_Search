How much of the variance of matter is due to scales

Imagine a Universe in which the matter power spectrum behaves as
$$\mathcal{P}\sim k^{0.8}$$
How much of the variance (not variance squared!) of matter is due to scales around $k=k_1=10^{2.9}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$,
versus scales around $k=k_2=10^{-3.0}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$
To be explicit, how much is:
$$\frac{\sigma(k\sim k_1)}{\sigma(k\sim k_2)}?$$
