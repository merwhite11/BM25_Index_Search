Are we searching for supercriticality of exoplanet water via passive spectral analysis?

Much spectrum analysis on many chemical compounds are mapped and categorized at Earth atmosphere (1000 millibar) or thereabouts.
But many celestial objects are of greater ranges of surface pressure.
And many chemical compounds reach supercriticality at higher pressure.
One of those chemical compound is water molecule.  Water molecule exhibit a different ro-vibrational in the diffraction spectral analysis at deeper pressure.
Are we compensating and broadening our their search parameters for super-criticality of such chemical compounds when doing this passive spectral analysis of and for their search of exoplanets?
Was reading this paper on “Mid-IR spectroscopy of supercritical water: from diluted gas to dense fluid”.
