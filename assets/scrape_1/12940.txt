22nd is shortest day in some places, but the 21st is shortest in other places. Can this be true?

The Winter Solstice in the Northern hemisphere in 2015 is December 22 at 04:49 UTC.  Where I'm located in Nova Scotia, Canada, that's December 22, 00:49 AST.  And so I would say the shortest day of the year is tomorrow, the 22nd.   But for my friends in Ontario, that's December 21, 23:49 EST.  And so, for them, the shortest day is today, the 21st.   
Does this make sense?
