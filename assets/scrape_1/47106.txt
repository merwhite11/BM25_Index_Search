What would solar calculations look like in another system?

When you are determining things (area, luminosity, radius etc) in a star, there are certain things that involve our suns characteristics like solar mass and solar radii. Say I were in another system- what would have to change? Could I just substitute all values that come from our sun with the star in that system?
Lets say Mirach (Beta Andromedae) was our host star. What would the values involving our suns characteristics change to?
If it isn't possible with our current technology, or isn't required to measure stars accurately from another system- let me know.
