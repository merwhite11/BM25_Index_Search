Does our universe have to be embedded in a higher dimensional space?

I've heard that our universe may be open or closed.  If it's closed it might have a toroid shape.  If this is the case, would that imply that our 3 spatial dimensions have to be embedded in a higher dimensional (spatially) space?  For example, the old asteroids video game was apparently a torus mapped to a 2-dim video screen, and it stayed in 2 dimensions, but with a specific behavior of moving objects.
