How would the characteristics of a habitable planet change with stars of different spectral types?

The tidal forces a habitable planet experiences increase with decreasing spectral type. So a habitable planet orbiting a smaller, less massive, and cooler star would experience much stronger tidal forces than one orbiting a bigger, more massive, and hotter star, and likely be tidally locked.
But what about other factors? How do other characteristics scale up with different stars?
For example would the orbital velocity of a planet in the habitable zone of a red dwarf be smaller than the velocity of a planet in the habitable zone of a more massive and hotter star?
