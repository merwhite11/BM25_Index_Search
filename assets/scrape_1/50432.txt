Why are almost all modern telescopes reflectors?

I've noticed lately that reflector telescopes are used much more than refractors. The majority of telescopes I see in telescope shops or featured by people online are reflectors. Even the Hubble and JWST are reflector telescopes. Is the reflector just preferred by a lot of people or are there real advantages of having a reflector over a refractor?
