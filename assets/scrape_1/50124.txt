Why does electron degeneracy pressure not stop massive star collapse?

I was thinking a little bit, and never asked myself the following. If white dwarfs do not collapse, because electron degeneracy pressure stops the star from collapsing by its own gravity, and this is due to the Pauli exclusion principle, then why aren't neutron stars held by the same pressure? How does a star become a more compact object if the electrons "cannot be more together", what is going on when the inverse beta decay process "violates" the Pauli exclusion principle (for electrons)? And why is neutron degeneracy pressure now the one that doesn't allows gravity to do its thing?
I think I have a wrong picture, like that the stars are first on a "white dwarf state" and then moves to a "neutron star state" and in reality a white dwarf is a result of a very specific final evolution phase of a low mass kind of star. And on the other hand a neutron star is the core remnant of a massive star.
I don't think this is the answer because why would the core go from an iron solid state to a degenerate gas of neutrons (and other stuff) without converting in a electron degenerate gas, but that it was what came to my mind.
Another thing that maybe answers my question, is quantum field theory. I mean, in this model there are particles that have some energy, properties and quantum numbers, and if you have the proper ones you can have any physical possible state, so at some point the question is not why something is violating the Pauli exclusion principle instead the question would be, which state is more probable to achieve given the conditions the object brings.
Thanks for reading, I'll be waiting for an answer.
