Did Earth "tilt" seasonally before it was accepted that the world was not flat?

Before it was widely accepted that the Earth was round, how did astronomers describe the yearly movement of the sun to south in the Northern Winter that produced the seasons? Did the Earth wobble or did the Sun just not have a perfectly circular trajectory around the Earth? Did this perspective change when we realized the Earth was a globe? What about before Heliocentrism was the norm?
