Convert MJD date range to number of days elapsed in IDL

Hopefully I'm in the appropriate section as my question is mainly about coding, but it's for astronomy. 
Right now I'm trying to figure out how I can take a range of MJD values and convert them into number of days elapsed so I can normalize a plot of two supernova and their absolute magnitudes over time in IDL. Is there a simple conversion for this I'm not seeing or do I need to tediously convert every value to determine the number of days to use for my x-axis?
Note: I do not wish to convert to the date, but the actually number of days elapsed as to normalize my two plots for comparison.
Thanks!
