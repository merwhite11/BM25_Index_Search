What time and where on earth is the latest solar noon?

For context: I am visiting Portugal from Australia and after observing that people tend to start their days later, I realised that solar noon also seems to occur at a later time - about 1.20pm at the moment. I don't recall solar noon every occurring at such a late time in Australia. When and where is the latest solar noon on earth?
