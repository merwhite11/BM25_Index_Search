Symmetry in Hawking radiation?

I have a question concerning how Hawking radiation works.
As I understand, a pair of particle-antiparticle may pop to existence near the event horizon (from a virtual particle).
Then it might happen that the negative particle (antimatter) gets captured by the black hole whereas the positive particle (matter) escapes.
This results in a net loss of the black hole mass. If you repeat this process an astonishing number of times the Black Hole might end up completely evaporating.
Am I right so far? (Even if the explanation is not very mathematical)
My question then is: 
This assumes that when a pair particle-antiparticle is created, a bias towards antiparticles being captured and particles escaping must exist.
Otherwise, the mass of the black hole might fluctuate, but in average for big numbers of pairs, equal percentage of particles and antiparticles would be captured/escape.
So, is there really a bias needed for the black hole to loose mass, or is it something wrong about my understanding of Hawking radiation?
Thanks
