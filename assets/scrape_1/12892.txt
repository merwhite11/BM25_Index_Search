Why is there no time in the distance equation using Hubble constant, red shift and speed of light?

So I had some problem and I think I solved it, then I began to dig out things around it and I found some equations using red shift etc. to get speed of the object in Universe relative to us and then I found this one:
distance=speed of light/Hubble constant*red shift
It took some time before I found the thing which seems to be wrong with this thing. 
How can I get the distance traveled if there is no time mentioned?
Thanks in advance!
