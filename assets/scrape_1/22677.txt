Does Absolute Velocity Exist?

It seems everyone is on the same page about there being no "absolute velocity" due to the fact that everything is relativistic. However, this leaves me confused. This seems to be disconnected with the concept that the speed of light is in fact an unchanging constant. But to state that all speed is relative to an object is to essentially say, "speed does not exist, but is only relative to an observer". But yet, the speed of light is a calculable constant that never changes. How then, can we say, there is no such thing as absolute speed?
If I throw a flashlight in space that is turned on 50mph, does the speed of the emitted light from the flashlight increase by 50 miles per hour in the direction I threw it? Of course not. We know this. But if this is truly the case, how then can there not be an absolute velocity which could be calculated by determining the speed of light in relevance to the object we're measuring (since the speed of light is constant)?
Please help because this is bothering me.
