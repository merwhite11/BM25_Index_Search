Why does the cloud of Orion Nebula appear more distinct when I am not directly looking at it?

I have a 6cm aperture newtonian refractor telescope through which I saw the Orion Nebula yesterday night. As all you can hope with a telescope of such a small aperture, I saw some faint cloudy structure, but when I looked away from the cloud through the telescope it appeared to be more distinct and dense. Why is it so?
