Where exactly does the Moon flip, given that it appears the other way up in the other hemisphere?

I've read in multiple sources that the Moon appears the other way up in Northern Hemisphere vs Southern Hemisphere. Here is one that explains why: Does the Moon look different in the northern and southern hemispheres?
My question is, where is the line drawn in this case where the moon 'flips'? Is it exactly the equator? I'm not sure if it is, the simple 'thought experiment' in the above link assumes (for simplicity's sake) that the orbit of the Moon is exactly above the equator. According to Wikipedia, the orbit of the Moon is slightly tilted, and our own earth also tilts from time to time. Where does the moon flip exactly? Does it change throughout the year as our earth change its tilt? If so, how? Which are the areas that always see the northern look or the southern one throughout the year?
