Do far away stars that we observe today still exist?

I don't know much about the astronomy or the universe but enjoy reading articles from time to time as they pop up. Just finished reading an article on CNN that discussed how a South African telescope has discovered hundreds of galaxies, some 200 million light years away.
This got me thinking: Are these galaxies and or some of their stars we see in telescopes still there? Let's say STAR X is confirmed to be 200 million light years away. What if it completely exploded 1 million years ago? Wouldn't we need to wait 199 million years before we could detect that?
