Has the iron core of Mars really solidified?

In the Nova episode "Origins: Earth is Born", Neil DeGrasse Tyson states, "But Mars is just a fraction the size of the Earth, so it cooled more rapidly. And as it cooled, its molten iron core hardened. As a result, Mars stopped generating its magnetic shield." (February 28, 2004)

This comment from Tyson is consistent with what I have long believed. But I wonder.
The melting point of iron (Fe) is around 1538 째C.
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_points_of_the_elements_(data_page)
The the geothermal gradient for Mars is estimated to be around 6 째C per km.
see: What is the temperature 55 km beneath the surface of Mars?
If the estimate of 6 째C per km is the ballpark, then I would expect that iron is molten as a mere 256 km of depth. At the core of Mars (over 3000 km in depth) I would expect the temperatures to be far higher than 1538 째C.
It seems to me that it is impossible for iron to be in solid form at Mars' core.
