Does CIBER Experiment from Caltech suggest that there can be lots of stars which are not in any galaxy?

My question is about the implications of the observations recently made by the Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment, or CIBER, from Caltech. I've read at Caltech web site:

"The total light produced by these stray stars is about equal to the background light we get from counting up individual galaxies."

Does that suggest that about a half of the stars in the observable universe could not belong to any galaxy?
