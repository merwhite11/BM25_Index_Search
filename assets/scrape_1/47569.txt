On other planets, does the sun appear to pass through the same zodiac constellations?

Seen from Earth, the sun travels on a year-long orbit across the celestial sphere, passing through the twelve zodiac constellations.
As I understand it, this path depends on our orbital plane---if our orbital plane were tilted, the sun's path would pass through different zodiac constellations.
Is that right? If so, does the sun's annual path pass through different constellations on any other planets in our system? I know that most planets lie in approximately the same orbital plane---but what about Mercury, with a 6.3 degree tilt?
Note that this is not a question about whether the stars themselves will look the same; I know that the interplanetary distance is much smaller than the distance to the nearest stars, so the stars will not noticeably shift as you move throughout our solar system. It is a question about whether the sun's path will transit through different constellations when seen from different planets.
