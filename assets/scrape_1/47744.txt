Does the .43 arc-second per year deviation of Mercury's orbit from Newtonian predictions mean that its position is 'off' by 75 miles per year?

If I divide the elliptical circumference of Mercury's orbit by .43 arcseconds, I get an answer of almost exactly 75 miles....
BUT, it is the precession of the periapses that is off, not 'just' its position along its orbit, so...
Is my calculation correct?  If I drew a straight line (actually, a slightly curved one) from its actual position after one year, to its Newton-predicted one, would it be off by 75 miles?
