Is it possible that we see our solar system as a star?


A few days ago I just read here that our galaxies (one of which we are part of) move or expand faster than light,
And read here that light we see from stars is extremely old, maybe more than several years.

If galaxies' expansion is faster than the light of stars, then is it possible that we see our own Sun as a star somewhere because light may reach us later than expansion?
