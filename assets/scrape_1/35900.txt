The anomaly of spiral galaxies and the need for dark matter

Please could some explain this to me - I understand that some galaxies are rotating with a speed that the stars on the outer reaches should not be held within the spiral given the observed matter and consequent gravitational field it forms. As a consequence of this, we are looking for dark matter that would compensate for this imbalance. But my question is this, how do we know that a black hole found at the centre of many galaxies is not providing the ‘extra’ gravitional curved space time required to hold the spiral galaxy together ?
