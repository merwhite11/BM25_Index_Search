Convert coordinates between RA/dec and WGS 84 (SRID=4326)

I've imported the HYG Database from http://www.astronexus.com/node/34 and now I need to convert all RA/dec stars positions to fit in a WGS 84 coordinates (SRID=4326) PostGIS map (-180 to 180, 90 to -90).

EDIT: Ok, I think MerseyViking gives the answer in https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/2459/what-coordinate-system-should-be-used-to-store-geography-data-for-celestial-coor telling to create a new coordinate system. Can someone give a look and some opinion?
EDIT 2 (After answered): Fantastic!! I need to show the results of whuber and Dieudonn√©'s answer. The first picture I show the query in QGIS. In second picture you can see the real positions in a map. The scale is different - Find Shaula, Nunki and Antares.
This is the conversion method ('H' is for Hyparcus in my database):
insert into stars 
    select 
        id, 
        proper_name, 
        ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint( (-ra * 15), dec),4326),
        mag,
        'H'
    from hygn
    where (proper_name is not null)
