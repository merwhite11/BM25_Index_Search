Does the existence of hydrogen in the universe create an obscuration effect similar to the way air does at great distances?

I've had this question for a while. I understand the universe is full of "dust". I am also aware of the fact that there is an average measure of particle density in the universe.
I am assuming for this question that these are actually separate, meaning where there is dust, there is dust, everywhere else, there is the background "1 proton per cubic meter" (or whatever, not important to be exact here). It could be that this is a false dichotomy and therefore the question falls away.
If not, I ask on the latter: this "1 proton per cubic meter", on the scale of billions of light years - does it produce a dimming/colouring of what we see that we have to take into account? In the same way distant mountains become blue because air isn't 100% transparent?
