What is the meaning of integrated emission maps for these chemical species?


In the Astrobites article Spectral Line Survey Reveals New Molecules in Two Protoplanetary Disks integrated emission maps depict the spatial distribution of the flux received from each "line." I am unsure as to what this line is, nor do I know what the x and y axes represent in terms of interstellar molecules' emissions.
Do the x and y axes just represent the position and velocity of the molecules in a galaxy?
