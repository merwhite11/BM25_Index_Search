Lack of planets in the Oort Cloud

With the current news about the possibility of a planet in the Oort cloud, I was thinking, why is the matter in the Oort cloud distributed so? It makes sense that inside the planet region there is not a huge concentration of comets and meteors, but why is the matter inside the cloud itself not agglomerating? It seems like there is enough matter to form not one or two, but many more planets.
