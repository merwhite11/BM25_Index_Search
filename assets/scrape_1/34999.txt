Could the Sun's planetary nebula be dangerous for the planets?

Since the Sun's mass isn't high enough it won't go supernova being a red giant but instead release a planetary nebula. So that seems to be kind of a substitute for a supernova. Would ejecting the planetary nebula be any dangerous for the planets of this system or maybe even other planetary systems close to the Sun?
I mean, the Sun releases its outer layers forming a planetary nebula. What remains is essentialy the Sun's core and will collapse to a white dwarf. What if the released matter (outer layers of the Sun) collides with a planet or moon?
