What percent of all stars that have lived (up to now) are stellar remnants?

According to this post, I found that about 90% of all stars are main sequence stars. So I am assuming that the other 10% consists of protostars, older giant stars, and stellar remnants. So I'm wondering how much of the stellar population is dead (i.e. turned into a remnant, excluding supernova progenitors that blow apart the whole star without leaving anything behind)?
