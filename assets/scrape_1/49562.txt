What unit of year in JPL Small-Body Database Lookup?

I'm new to astronomy and therefore probably missing the obvious here, but what type of year (tropical, sidereal?) is used for the orbital periods in the JPL Small-Body Database Lookup? For example, the data for Halley's comet here gives the period as 75.91006173810142 years. But I can't see a note detailing their definition of "year". Thank you
