When was the variation of apparent diameter of the moon first measured?

The orbit of the Moon around the Earth isn't quite a circle. Since distance between the Earth and the Moon changes over time, the apparent diameter of the Moon also varies very slightly. With a digital camera, you can observe this by counting pixels. However, this variation is very small and not easily noticed.
Who discovered that the angular diameter of the Moon varies over time?
