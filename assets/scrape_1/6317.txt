If we count Avogadro's Number of stars that are closest to Earth, how big that space would be?

I think that the answer to this question will be useful as a scale to appreciate the size of the universe.
So, If we count Avogadro's Number of stars that are closest to Earth, how big that space would be? And how many galaxies/clusters will be engulfed in that space? And for a start, let's just consider only three dimensions.
