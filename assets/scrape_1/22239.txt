Getting Solar Noon from Sunset and Sunrise

I've seen the solar noon formula described as snoon = 720 – 4*longitude – eqtime. I'm curious if it is equally reliable within a relatively small margin of error (+-60 seconds) to simply get the midpoint between sunrise and sunset, given that data is already calculated and available.
Is there any occasion when solar noon wouldn't be equal time from sunrise and sunset, give or take the aforementioned margin of error?
