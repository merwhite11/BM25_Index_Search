What are recent discoveries with Earth-based radar telescopes?

The Wikipedia article on radar astronomy lists a few important discoveries using radar technology in general, i.e. also using space-crafts:

The following is a list of planetary bodies that have been observed by this means:

Mercury - Improved value for the distance from the earth observed (GR test). Rotational period, libration, surface mapping, esp. of polar regions.
Venus - first radar detection in 1961. Rotation period, gross surface properties. The Magellan mission mapped the entire planet using a radar altimeter.
Earth - numerous airborne and spacecraft radars have mapped the entire planet [...]
Mars - Mapping of surface roughness from Arecibo Observatory. The Mars Express mission carries a ground-penetrating radar.
Jupiter System - Galilean satellites
Saturn System - Rings and Titan from Arecibo Observatory, mapping of Titan's surface and observations of other moons from the Cassini spacecraft.


I am interested in recent discoveries (and scientific references) with Earth-based radar observatories such as the Arecibo Observatory, the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex, RT-70, Pluton, Deep Space Network and any other one I missed.
Here "discovery" is meant in the wider sense, i.e. the gain of scientific knowledge. The discovery of a new object would be such a discovery, but the mapping of a known object would also be a discovery.

What will succeed the Arecibo Observatory?
How did Arecibo detect methane lakes on Titan, and image Saturn's rings?
