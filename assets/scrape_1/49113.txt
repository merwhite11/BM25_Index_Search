Lunar sky brightness

Looking at the report "The Measurements of Sky Brightness on Lunokhod-2"1, I read that the day time visible light sky brightness was so large that it was off the scale. Unfortunately I have no idea how to convert their units of measurement into units I am familiar with, lux or lumens.
