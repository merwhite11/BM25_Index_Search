Why can't 'dead' galaxies start forming stars again if they merge with another, 'active' galaxy?

I heard Matthew O'Dowd mention on PBS Space-Time that dead galaxies cannot start re-forming stars even if they collect gas and/or dust from elsewhere, or even merge with another galaxy....
Why?  And what, exactly, causes galaxies to stop forming new stars to begin with?  A plain lack of material, or the wrong temperature, or the wrong 'starter' material? (Carbon monoxide, e.g.?)
