What are some dark features on (or qualities to) the moon?

I know there are mare, oceani, and lacunae, but anything else that I'm overlooking from lists of lunar features?
Does the "dark"/far side have a particular, maybe Latin scientific name (tho it gets lit as much as the near side, of course), or the unlit area aside from 'night'?
(I'm trying to name a kitten who was born July 19th during the Apollo XI 50th anniversary. All girls, the one white one with soft black extremities is Luna, one all black but the barest white dusting about her neck is Mare, then there's Mare's essentially identical twin, who needs the name.)
