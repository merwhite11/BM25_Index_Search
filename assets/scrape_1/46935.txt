Not Able to View Objects with Barlow Lens

I am new to using a telescope and am having a hard time using a Barlow lens. I was able to find Jupiter multiple times using a 6mm lens with a telescope that has a D = 60mm and FL = 700mm. I am very close to seeing some detail (making out some color/features) but it is still a little too blurry. Whenever I equip the Barlow lens (x2) the object is nowhere to be seen (even when focusing and moving around). Any tips to using a Barlow? Is 6mm too small to use with a Barlow?
