About how many revolutions has the Earth made around the sun?

The Earth is about 4.543 billion years old.
However, the length of a year can be changed by anything from an impact to a natural cycle of orbit changes to a slow drift toward or away from the sun to the tug of a nearby body.
So while the Earth is about 4.543 billion modern years old, it may have revolved around the sun a significantly different number of times.  
What is a reasonable estimate for how many revolutions - factoring in known geologic events - that the Earth has made around the Sun?


This question touches on the topic of orbital changes but never really answers what I'm asking here.  
The second answer on this Quora question seems to answer my question but I don't know if that source is reputable, and the actual calculations and reasoning are not given
This reddit discussion touches on the subject but has differing / inconclusive answers
