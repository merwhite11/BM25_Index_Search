Bright light in sky that slowly faded away

North Carolina June 5th 2021 at about 1:45 a.m. my boyfriend walked to me to my car just to see a bright like just above the tree line. Didnâ€™t think anything of it. Finished our goodnight talk and looked back at the light. It was still there and we watched it slowly move and fade away. It looked as thought it was the northern star but extremely brighter. It did not fade behind the tree line but faded away in a straight line from where it was just sitting stationary.
