How will the expansion of the Sun influence Earth as a celestial body after 5 billion years?

Science news have flooded our news feed again about how our Sun could swallow Earth. This time due to a real documentation of a similar event in an other system.

From what I've read over the years in various cosmology articles about the future of our Sun, there are three scenarios:

The Sun expands swallowing Earth
The Sun expands and pushes Earth to a new orbit
The Sun becomes a dwarf, Earth turns to an ice planet

What I don't understand is how Sun's expansion can influence a planet's orbit since the expansion is a product of internal nuclear reactions and the mass is essentially the same. What changes is the volume. An orbit does not change due to volume changes right?
By "swallowing" do they mean the Sun will literally expand by 150.000.000 km to actually reach Earth or is the "swallow" a result of an Earth orbit destabilization dropping it in the Sun ?
