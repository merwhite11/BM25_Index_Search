Is it possible to use Hubble Telescope to observe Earth in the past?

We can observe many astronomical objects and structures beyond our solar system,  however our observations are as the objects appeared in the past due to the speed of light. My question: "Is it possible to use Hubble Telescope to observe Earth as it was in the past" by turning Hubble's lens to a previous location of Earth in space?
