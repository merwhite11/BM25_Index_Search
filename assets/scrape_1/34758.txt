What methods can high school students use to measure the radius of the earth?

I suppose they could split into 2 groups and use the shadow method from different latitudes.
Maybe they could also use the stars on the horizon at two different latitudes.
Is measuring a ship below the horizon feasible ?
What other methods could be tried by high school students?
