Why are blackholes generally not considered as solid spheres with an escape velocity FTL?

I was reading Do Stars Vanish Into a Black Hole or Crash Against a Surface? A New Test Answers on space.com.
It says the following:

Another proposed alternative to event horizons is the "hard surface
theory," which suggests that matter within a black hole is destroyed
by smashing into a solid surface. Instead of a singularity with no
surface area, the black hole is a giant mass with a hard surface, and
material being pulled closer — such as a star — would not actually
fall into a black hole, but hit this hard surface and be destroyed. If
that were the case, the collision should create a large burst of
light.

If we focus on the last sentence:

If that were the case, the collision should create a large burst of
light.

If the escape velocity of black hole becomes at certain altitude above the say solid surface of a blackhole more than that of speed of light, would we still see a large burst of light when the collision happens? Black holes are incredibly dense wouldn't it make more sense from them to be solid?
Something like a dark star.
No one really knows what happens to the matter at the singularity. Wouldn't it make sense that the reason that a black hole gets larger is due to more matter being smashed into the singularity making it gain mass. It also seems that black holes can be hurled out their galaxies, it must be in some form of matter that it stays together even when hurled out?
