Was comet ISON in a Kepler orbit prior to disintegrating?

Was comet ISON in a Kepler orbit prior to disintegrating? If so, it is possible over time that Kepler orbits can be altered by increases or decreases in the mass of of celestial bodies?
For instance if ISON was in a Kepler orbit and it lost mass did it maintain its orbit and disintegrate in its orbital track or does it alter its track due to the loss of mass?
