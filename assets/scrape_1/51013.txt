What is the elemental composition of the universe?

What is the current distribution of elements in the observable universe? Wikipedia lists the composition of the Milky Way, but I'm not sure how the values would change if intergalactic medium were included. My understanding is that the density of this matter has been determined, but not its elemental composition.
