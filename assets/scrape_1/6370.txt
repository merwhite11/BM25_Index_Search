How massive can a star be at birth?

We have discovered some incredibly massive stars. R136a1, the most massive known star is estimated to have 265 times mass as our Sun. Yet it has been burning for at least a million years, and must have shed a considerable mass as stellar wind. In its infancy, R136a1 must have been much more massive.
Which got me thinking about the question: What is the theoretical limit of mass that a newborn star can have?
