Which moons have cold traps? (i.e. low ecliptic inclination in orbital and rotational axes)

Both the Moon and Mercury have polar cold traps in polar craters, with signs of volatiles. This is of course not as interesting on a moon in the outer Solar System which consists of volatiles anyway. But suppose that there is some use for very cold real estate shielded from the Sun out there.
Which moons are candidates to have eternally shadowed (or eternally sunlit) regions, and wouldn't they be even colder than those on the Moon? Jupiter and Neptune have less than 2 degrees inclination so their moons maybe are good candidates.
