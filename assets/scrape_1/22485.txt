why there is a circle of light surrounding Sun and Moon?

One day when I was playing basketball I saw a circle around the bright Sun. It is a perfect circle with a radius of about 20-30 km. 
Why does this circle of light form? I have seen the same also around the moon. But this does not happen every day. Why ?
