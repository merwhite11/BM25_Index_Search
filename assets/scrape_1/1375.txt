Does gravity slow or speed light up?

The speed of light in a vacuum is presumably the fastest speed possible.  
if gravity bends the course of light, does this imply that gravity the retards light so it is moving at a slower speed?  If it affects its course, why cannot gravity affect its speed -- or does it?
And if gravity does affect the speed of light, what does that say about our measurements of the distance to the farthest observable object?  Could we assume that all the gravity effects across 15 billion light-years even themselves out?  Or is the actual distance across the observable universe subject to unknowable variations due to gravity effects?
