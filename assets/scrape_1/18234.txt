What's the terminology of a meteor "ditch" when impact happens at an angle?

When a meteor hit the surface of a planet, it creates an impact crater. When an meteor hit the surface of a planet at an angle, like it usually happens in the movies, what do you call the long "ditch" that is formed before the actual crater where the meteor came to rest?
