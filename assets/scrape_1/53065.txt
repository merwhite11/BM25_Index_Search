How will China's Xuntian space telescope use its Terahertz capability? THz Spectroscopy? Imaging? Something else?

In the 2nd link on slide 7 in the table of specifications:

Wavelength 0.255-1 μm, 0.9-1.7 μm, 0.41-0.51 THz

Near-Terahertz radio astronomy is a regular thing, ALMA's band 10 goes up to 0.95 THz for example

How does ALMA produce stable, mutually coherent ~THz local oscillators for all of their dishes?
Do circa 1 THz radio telescope front end amplifiers actually down convert before amplifying? At what frequency does amplification become untenable?
Highest frequency that's been imaged by a radio telescope?

and the famous images "of" supermassive black holes (M78* and Sgr A*) were made at about 0.23 THz. The Xuntian space telescope's range is between these.

What part of the EM spectrum was used in the black hole image?
Why does the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) not include telescopes from Africa, Asia or Australia?

And I think the Sofia measurements were at about 2 THz:

this answer to Is Sofia a radio telescope proper?

Question: How will China's Xuntian (the Chinese Survey Space Telescope) use its Terahertz capability? THz Spectroscopy? Imaging? Something else?
