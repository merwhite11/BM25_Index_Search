Will you be able to see the corona in a 90%+ partial eclipse?

I live in Champaign, Illinois (see map) and am planning to watch the August 21st solar eclipse. This community is within the 95% totality range, but not within the path of totality. Will I be able to see the Baily's beads, and more importantly will I be able to see the corona?
