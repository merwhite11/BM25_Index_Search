What is the name of the cycle whereby the lunar azimuth and altitude recur on a given day?

Like the Metonic cycle, except for position in the sky, not phase.
Original question: If I look up at the moon tonight, how long before it is in the same apparent position, and same phase, again?
I realized I can calculate this myself, if only I know two piece of information. Unfortunately I do not know the name of the second.
My question should be answered by the product of:

the Metonic cycle, and
the cycle where the moon's azimuth and altitude recur on a given day

What is the name of this second cycle?
