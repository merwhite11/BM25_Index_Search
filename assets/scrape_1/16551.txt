How does 2015 RR245 compare to the other KBOs predicting "Planet 9"?

2015 RR245 was recently announced, in a highly eccentric orbit in the KBO. From what I understand, the so called "Planet 9" was predicted because these objects tended to be pointed in a particular direction. How is this object pointed relative to the other KBOs?
