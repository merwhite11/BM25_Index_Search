What makes the moon, a super moon

Caught a sight of moon tonight (by chance) and came in surprise that moon looks thrice in size to its usual size. 
Mostly called as Blue moon. Didn't succeed in getting the details and explanations of the phenomenon on Internet. Wikipedia just tells about the origin of the word blue moon and particular dates at which super moon is more obvious but doesn't shed the light on the true physical causes.  
Just wondering what could be the causes that makes the appearance of moon (near the horizon) so big.
