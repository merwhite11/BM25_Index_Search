calculating the position of the sun by using degrees and determining date and time

so i found this code and  even looked up the documentation on swe_suncross() most i've seen its - 88 degrees  but can one determine this using any degrees

# set ephemeris files path
swe.set_ephe_path('~/Downaloads/swisseph-master/')

# birth time as Julian day number (UT), for example
birth_t = swe.julday(1988, 6, 12, 5.5)
# sun longitude at birth
sun_longitude = swe.calc_ut(birth_t, swe.SUN)[0][0]
# longitude searched
xlon = swe.degnorm(sun_longitude - 88)
# start search 90 deays prior to birth
tstart = birth_t - 90
# find exact crossing time
res = swe.solcross_ut(xlon, tstart)
# turn it into a date
date = swe.revjul(res)

print("Year:", date[0], "Month:", date[1], "Day:", date[2], "Hour:", date[3])

and i get sent in the future ???
Year: 1989 Month: 3 Day: 14 Hour: 1.8550639897584915
i have tried other numbers( less than 88 ) and was still in the future .. what am I doing wrong ?
