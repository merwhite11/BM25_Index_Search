Which eyepieces I can use it for best viewing experience using my existing telescope?

Telescope: Orion 09843 SpaceProbe 3,3 inch aperture(76mm), 700mm focal length, eyepieces - 25mm and 10mm focal lengths
Hi, I am very happy and excited to   see moon craters, Jupiter and Saturn. And planets like Mars, Venus, and Uranus are just looks 
like a brighter star but not able to see its surface color. Similarly Jupiter looks like white small ball 
instead of an orange surface. I am very much excited and  want to go bit closer. So please guide me list of eyepieces that I can use with this scope at least to see Jupiter  surface and big moon craters.
