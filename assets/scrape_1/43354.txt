Is there software to calculate/plot decomposed rotation curves from observational data (FITS, etc)?

I have observation data of galaxies (in FITS format). From the FITS data, I want to calculate & plot the decomposed rotation curves as pictured below. Is there a software package that will do that (preferably in Python)?
Context: I'm interested in finding the radial mass distribution of the dark matter in each galaxy. If there is already a database or catalog of this, then telling me that would be even better.
