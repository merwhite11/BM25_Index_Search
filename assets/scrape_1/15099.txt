Is the material that could have formed a "Super-earth" divided among the four terrestrial planets

I know "super-earths" are quite common in other planetary systems, but there are none in the Solar System. Is it due to the material that could have created a single large super-earth being used to create four smaller terrestrial planets in the Solar System?
