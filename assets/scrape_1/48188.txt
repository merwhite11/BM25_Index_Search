How to interpret this spectrum of the "new DESI Quasar at z = 6.53"; what causes the big edge at about 9150 Angstroms?

I'm not exacty sure why but Scitech Daily's Seeing Dark Energyâ€™s True Colors: DESI Creates Largest 3D Map of the Cosmos includes the graphic and caption below.
It indicates a quasar in a Hubble image and included is an annotated spectrum from 5000 to 9800 Angstroms of a "new DESI Quasar at z = 6.53" , which shows what looks like flat noise between 5000 and 9100 Angstroms and then a sudden jump up at about 9150 Angstroms and higher.
The article talks about using DESI data to get redshifts and therefore distances, but there's no indication of how this spectrum and its pronounced feature is used to do this.
So I'd like to ask:
Question: How to interpret this spectrum of the "new DESI Quasar at z = 6.53"; what causes the big edge at about 9150 Angstroms?



A new quasar discovered using DESI gives a glimpse of the universe as it was nearly 13 billion years ago, less than a billion years after the Big Bang. This is the most distant quasar discovered with DESI to date, from a DESI very high-redshift quasar selection. The background shows this quasar and its surroundings in the DESI Legacy imaging surveys. Credit: Jinyi Yang, Steward Observatory/University of Arizona
