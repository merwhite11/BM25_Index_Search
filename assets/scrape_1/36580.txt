Which binocular should I buy to be able to see Saturn and its rings?

I am new to Astronomy and never had a binocular to look at the sky, I read somewhere that already with a 30x optical zoom should be possible to spot Saturn and see its rings, is that true?
I have a budget of up to 400 bucks, which binocular would be the best in this range to see Saturn and other objects in the night sky?
