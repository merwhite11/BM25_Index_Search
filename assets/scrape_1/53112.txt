What phases of a moon orbiting Proxima Centauri b could be seen?

Assuming a moon like Earth's natural satellite would be orbiting the Proxima Centauri b at a similar distance, what moon phases could be seen from the planet's surface at coordinates 0;55?
Adding details:
Proxima Centauri b orbits Proxima Centauri at a distance of 0.04856 AU. It is in a habitable zone due to Proxima Centauri being a red dwarf with significantly lower luminosity than Earth.
But due to the short distance, the planet is tidally locked to its host star, and the same side is permanently facing the star. That, I assume, would constrain what moon phases could be seen from a particular point.
The coordinate system is similar to Earth's, with latitudes going from the equator up/down towards the poles and longitudes connecting the poles. Thus, in this case, latitude 0 is the equator, and 55 is Eastern or Western (it doesn't really matter as the star's position in the sky is permanent) longitude.
The hypothetical moon is similar in size and mass to the Earth's Moon and orbits the planet at a similar distance. As the planet has more mass than Earth, the moon orbits it in 575.3 hours. I don't know the moon orbit's relation to the planet's equatorial plane yet.
