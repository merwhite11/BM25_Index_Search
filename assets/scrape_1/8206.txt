Do/did the asteroids contain enough water to create Earth's oceans?

It seems from the recent Science paper by Altwegg et al (2014) that the commonly accepted source of Earth's water being the comets might not be (completely) true. Their study suggest that the water in the comet they studied is different from Earth's (higher Deuterium content). The alternative source of water that Altwegg suggests is from asteroids. My perception is that there is not that much water in asteroids or at least not sufficient to create Earth's oceans. How much water is in asteroids now? How much water was there in asteroids reaching Earth when the oceans were formed?
