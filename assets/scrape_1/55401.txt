Planets Named After Roman Gods, Except Earth

I’ve looked this up, but not necessarily sure the internet has the right answer.  Why are the planets in our solar system named after Roman gods, except Earth,  and why is only one of the nine planets a female?  Interestingly, Mercury, according the internet "serves as the guide of souls to the underworld” and Pluto, which was, but is no longer a planet, was named after the Roman God of the underworld.
