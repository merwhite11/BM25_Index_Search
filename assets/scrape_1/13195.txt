What is the centre of rotation of Pluto?

I know that Pluto and Charon have been found to circle round each other, hence the reason Pluto is no longer a planet I believe, which would mean that the centre of rotation is an arbitrary (!) point somewhere between the two of them. Where is it please? Can it be calculated?
