How early/late is the human race as intelligent life in the universe/milkyway?

In the history of the universe, there has been a time, where intelligent life had no chance to develop (e.g. in the early universe, when no habitable planets have formed) and there is a time today where we know, that at least one intelligent lifeform has evolved in our universe/galaxy. Between these two times many events took place in order to provide the conditions, that (intelligent) life can evolve. So I wonder myself:
Considering the time, when the conditions in the universe became life-friendly, has the human race as intelligent life evolved early, late or something in between?
