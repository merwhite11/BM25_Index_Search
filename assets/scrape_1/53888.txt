What are probabilities of finding a star with the specific stellar type?

I am a programming tutor, and with my student we were writing a program simulating a flight through the cosmos.
I thought that it would be great to make the circles representing stars more realistic. I have found the table showing size and colour of a star by its stellar type, but what is the probability that any given star is going to be of a specific type?1 The simple solution would be to just to select at random from the list, but that is too trivial.
If there would be some data showing the total counts of stars by the type, it would be trivial to convert into the probability. But i cannot find such.
