How can 'HD 140283' be older than the universe?

Scientists have known about the star HD 140283, informally nicknamed the Methuselah star, for more than 100 years, since it cruises across the sky at a relatively rapid clip. The star moves at about 800,000 mph (1.3 million km/h) and travels the width of the full moon in the sky every 1,500 years or so, researchers said. Its apparent magnitude is 7.223.
Previous research had estimated that the Milky Way galaxy's so-called
"Methuselah star" is up to 16 billion years old. That's a problem,
since most researchers agree that the Big Bang that created the
universe occurred about 13.8 billion years ago.
Later estimates show that the star could be as old as 14.5 billion years (Â± 0.8 billion years), which is still it older than the universe's calculated age of about 13.8 billion years. This is an obvious dilemma.
How can a star be older than the universe itself?
