A question about the cosmic distance ladder

So I have a table of data for the following stars: Vega, $\alpha$ Crv, $\beta$ CVn and $\epsilon$ Eri. I have been given their parallax, luminosity, $m_{B}$ magnitude and the $m_{V}$ magnitude. Now I'm asked to first calculate the distance $d$ of all the stars aswell as the absolute bolometric magnitude $(M_{bol})$ of the stars. Now I used the basic parallax formula for the distances: $$d=\frac{1 AU}{\tan{\theta}}$$ with $\theta$ the parallax in milli-arcsec. Now as for the absolute bolometric magnitude, I first wanted to use the distance modulus to calculate the absolute magnitude, but since I don't have the bolometric magnitude this isn't possible I think, so I used the formula that uses the luminosity given by: $$M_{bol}=M_{bol,\odot}+2.5\log\frac{L_{\odot}}{L}$$ I think I found the right values, but now there is a second question where they ask to compare the apparent magnitude in the V-band of the four stars with the observed apparent magnitudes of stars with the same B-V index in the Pleiades cluster, where they've given a figure of the HR-diagram of the Pleiades. Then they ask to calculate the distance to the Pleiades based on the mean apparent visual magnitudes. So as I said the first question I think I have, so the distance and absolute bolometric magnitude, but I don't know how we can find a distance for the Pleiades based on all that.
