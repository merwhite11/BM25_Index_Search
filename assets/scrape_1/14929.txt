How long can you be trapped orbiting around a black hole for?

I have a story I wanna write but I want to be sure it's not completely scientifically irrelevant.
I know there is  black hole modelisation called the Kerr black holes, in which there is a limit around black holes called the event horizon. It's a spatial limit ; no light ray crossing this limit will ever be able to escape the gravity of the black hole. That's the definition of event horizon.
By extension, I guess any physical object (such as a spaceship) crossing the event horizon will be doomed to orbiting around the black hole until it gets destroyed. My question is about the time you can spend between the moment you cross the event horizon (= you are doomed) and the moment you actually die (for example by the tide effect, which basically destroys bodies because of the difference of attraction force between the feet and the head of a human body)? Could this moment last... 100 years ? 1000 years ? 
(for my story the more the better)
I know black holes studies are very theoretical, I'd just like to avoid any huge scientific plot holes.
I am quite unskilled in that domain of astronomy, about time dilatation, etc. So if anyone has any idea of the order of magnitude of the time a object can spend beyond a black hole event horizon before it gets destroyed ? 
Thanks for your answers :)
