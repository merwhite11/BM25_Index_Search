Am I using my Celestron 8 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope correctly?

I became interested in astronomy a few years ago and started with a Celestron AstroMaster 70AZ refractor telescope. That seemed nice, and I wanted to upgrade to a go-to telescope that was also more much more powerful, so I bought the 8 inch Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain.
It's great, but honestly I'm a bit disappointed because the magnification doesn't seem all that much stronger than my 70AZ. I haven't done a side by side comparison. But for example when looking at Saturn, I was expecting to see more than just a white ball with a ring around it - I was able to see that with my 70AZ. I thought I'd see colors, and maybe be able to differentiate between some of the bigger ring bands.
I haven't tried any deep sky objects. I'm using various lenses starting from 30mm down to 6mm.
Am I doing something wrong?
