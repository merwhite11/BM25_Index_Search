Why are the Pillars of Creation pillar-shaped?

The Pillars of Creation have a strong directional sense. They are referred to as "pillars" and another question asks how "tall" they are. Naively, it looks as if there is a source of "smoke" near the tips of the pillars, and the smoke is being blown by a wind. News explanations and Wikipedia explain that the pillars are formed by UV light from hot stars eroding clouds of molecular hydrogen, which suggests that the "smoke" is actually a void, but it still looks as if the void is being extended by the flow of a wind past the relevant stars.
But I have no confidence that this is right, and the Wikipedia article is not very clear. Popular media explanations also don't seem to address the geometry.
I see several possibilities:

The gas is still relative to most of the nearby stars, and a small number of hot stars are moving through that system, causing the pillars.
The hot stars are not in rapid motion relative to nearby stars, but the gas is flowing relative to that population.
The shape has nothing to do with relative flows.

What's the explanation? A pointer to a good article for the knowledgeable lay person would be helpful too.
