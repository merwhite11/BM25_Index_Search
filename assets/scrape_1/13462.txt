How to read Babylonians' tablet that were used to track Jupiter's movements?

There is a science news article on how Babylonians used geometry to track Jupiterâ€™s movements.
Here is an image of cuneiform tablet which shows Jupiter's movements.

From a layman's point of view, it looks like someone engraved gibberish on a tablet. How do we even know it was used to track Jupiter's movements.
Can anyone translate this? Thanks.
