If the Sun's trajectory were altered, would the solar system follow?

I was reading a text state that the sun is not stationary:

"it orbits the Galactic center once approximately every 226 million years as the galaxy spins which is also traveling through space towards an unknown source of gravity"

So does the solar system will also move when the Sun moves? Does it affect the stability of solar system? I am not much known to the cosmology so if my question is wrongly framed, please let me know.
