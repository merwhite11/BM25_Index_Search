What would happen if the earth's orbit were slightly perturbed?

Suppose a rogue planet came zipping through the solar system and changed the earth's orbit a little, including the plane of the orbit.
I have the idea that, in a complex system, orbits would tend toward roughly circular and in the same plane. In simulations of star clusters I've seen, they all whip around in a crazy dance, some of them flung from the system entirely, and the remainder in roughly circular orbits. In our own solar system I am vaguely aware that the stability of the planetary orbits has to do with the relations of the orbital periods, resonances, and that the early solar system was a chaotic place, with Jupiter wandering in and then out again, until everything settled down. Just because the primordial cloud had an average angular momentum doesn't mean the planets must have all originally orbited in the same plane.
So I have the idea that in a complex system, where the different bodies can affect each other's orbits, they would tend to become circular and in a plane. Comets and asteroids by contrast, besides having long orbital periods, can't change the planetary orbits to any meaningful degree, they're flying through predetermined gravitational fields that don't adapt to them. But if the earth's orbit were perturbed, I'm supposing that the inner planets would adjust and the earth's orbit would recircularize, even if it doesn't settle down to quite its original orbit.
I have to think that astronomers have simulated solar systems and come to some conclusions about that. Is anyone familiar with that and can say something about it?
