How to calculate apparent brightness in relation to the sun

I know that we can determine the apparent brightness of an object in our solar system using the following formula:
$$B=\frac{A\cdot L_S\cdot R^2}{D^2\cdot d^2}$$
$B$ = Brightness of observed object in watts
$A$ = Albedo of observed object
$L_S$ = Luminosity of the Sun in watts
$R$ = Radius of the observed object in meters
$D$ = Distance between the Sun and the observed object in meters
$d$ = Distance between the Earth and the observed object in meters
However, I find this isn't helpful in visualizing the brightness in your mind. I was wondering what modifications would be needed to this formula to make the result relative to the sun.
