Ninth planet - what else could it be?

So recently it was announced that there might be a ninth planet out there.
Some people (from NASA) say the odds are 50% that it is a real planet, since it hasn't been discovered by telescopes yet.
Let's say there is no ninth planet. Is there another explanation for those orbits that require a big mass (8 times earth mass) out there?
Could it even be a very small black hole (a few centimeters in radius) or maybe a clump of dark matter?
