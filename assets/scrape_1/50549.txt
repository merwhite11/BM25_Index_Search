What is the difference between the Synodic & the Sidereal Periods?

While studying Spherical Astronomy, I came to know the two terms: 'Synodic Period' & 'Sidereal Period'. Both were referring to the returning of a particular celestial body on the sky or the celestial sphere but I couldn't spot the difference between the two definitions. What is the actual difference between the two periods and what is their importance?
