Moon cycles used for gardening & harvesting

I appreciate that this question may deviate from the standard astronomy questions.
I have recently read an article that suggest that gardeners, farmers & winemakers etc sometime use the moon's phases to time when best to sow & harvest plants & their fruit. They say that the moisture levels in the soil are higher when there is a full moon exerting its gravitational pull from above & it’s suggested that this helps seeds to sprout. It’s also suggested many winemakers will avoid a full moon at all costs when harvesting the grapes, because although the added moisture in the soil may give you a fuller and juicier grape, this additional water is thought to dilute the taste of the fruit, resulting in a less successful vintage.
Do you think there’s truth in this & that the moon’s gravitation influence affects plant growth & the quality of fruit?
Also, I’m thinking that if this is true, surely it doesn’t need to be a Full Moon because, even during the New Moon & other moon phases the moon may not be visible or only partially visible, but if it’s in the sky above, it’s still exerting its gravitational pull from that direction in the same or similar way. Any ideas or comments most welcome.
