When using adaptive optics, what is the shortest timescale of atmospheric changes in refractive index that astronomers have to deal with?

I am interested in the astronomer's need for speed in wavefront correction, especially when measuring in NIR and visible domain.

What is the fastest abberation coming from atmospheric turbulence in any measurement setting (sun observation during day, night-time observations)? Does any astronomer need correction in the visible spectrum beyond e.g. 100 Hz?
Are fast systems practically limited by spatial resolution of the sensor?
Is there any way to get a quantitative overview how widespread adaptive optics is in astronomy today and which setups are currently in use?

Thank you for your thoughts!
