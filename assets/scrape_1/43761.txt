Flux vs. Velocity representation of spectra?

I'm looking for a basic explanation of the flux vs. velocity representation of a spectrum and how it's obtained from the regular flux vs. wavelength representation. A good example of this is in Arav et al 2001 (see here, Fig. 2 and 3).

More specific questions I can ask are:
• How do you convert between wavelength and velocity in these figures (i.e. what phenomenon are we using to make the conversion & what's the equation)?
• What thing has the velocity in question/what does the velocity represent? For example, is it the astrophysical object moving in this direction?
... But any further elaboration is much appreciated. As much as I've seen these (I'm trying to brush up, it's been a while since I've done astro stuff), I can't find any explanation for this; perhaps I don't know the right jargon, but yeah it's difficult to find a simple answer. Thanks in advance for the help.
