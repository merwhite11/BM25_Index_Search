How can we install a radar on radio telescopes like FAST or GMRT?

Recently I came across an article mentioning that ever since the failure of Arecibo telescope, we only have one asteroid radar imaging telescope which is Goldstone observatory.
The article also mentions the need of Asian (or any other country) radio observatory to upgrade their telescopes to telescope + radar system to take the place of Arecibo.
This made me wonder how can we upgrade such system instead of starting all over again (building a new telescope that could handle radar imaging as well).
