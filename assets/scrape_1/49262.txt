Is a black hole really a neutron star with a gravitational time dilation factor of 1.0

Here's why I'm asking.
The gravitational time dilation factor at the surface of a star or planet can be expressed as $$gr/c^2$$
In theory, the same equation should apply to the gravitational length contraction factor.
If the gravitational length contraction factor reaches 1.0 then all lengths at the surface are reduced to 0 and the mass becomes invisible.
This will occur when $$gr = c^2$$
Now I have read that the surface gravity, g, on the largest known neutron star is about $$7*10^{12} m/s^2$$
Which means it should become invisible when $$r=c^2/7*10^{12}$$
Or $$r=12.84km$$
But that's the approximate radius of the largest known neutron star. So, in theory, it is on the verge of invisibility.
If it was any bigger it would probably be seen as a black hole.
UPDATE
As my formula for Gravitational Length Contraction has been questioned, I'd like to explain it at least, without attempting to prove it:
In that formula, $g$ is the rate of length contraction from the centre to the surface of the mass in units of $m/s^2$.
But the contraction happens at the speed of light, so the $c^2$ term is a conversion from time squared to length squared.
So $g/c^2$ is the rate of length contraction from the centre to the surface in units of $m/m^2$ or $m/m$ per $m$ radius.
Multiplying this by the radius gives the length contraction factor at the surface in $m/m$.
UPDATE END
So is a black hole a neutron star with a gravitational length contraction factor of 1.0, or is it pure coincidence that the largest known neutron star has a gravitational length contraction factor very close to 1.0?
