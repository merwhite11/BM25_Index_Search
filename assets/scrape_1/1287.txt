What Is The Great Attractor?

I've heard that there is something called the Great Attractor which seems to have some kind of gravitational influence on objects in the Universe.  Is this some kind of theoretical notion posited in order to help answer a question in Astronomy, or is there an actual object which is greatly attracting?
Or is this an obsolete notion?
