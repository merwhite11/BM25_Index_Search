If a black hole has the same mass as me, then why dont i suck everything at my center of mass?

So, a black hole is very dense that you can get really close to its center of mass that it has a strong pull, well, if i have the mass of a black hole that has a really small event horizon, why doesnt my center of mass create an explosion from hawking radiation, or suck myself
