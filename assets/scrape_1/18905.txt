Plot of best available resolution vs wavelength - radio through gamma rays?

What I'm looking for is a graphic that shows in a general way the best available telescope resolution vs wavelength throughout the entire wavelength spectrum. So for example, there might be two very high resolution peaks aroud 

millimeter wavelengths (ALMA) 
visible wavelengths (HST and many ground telescopes with Adaptive Optics)

The beautiful image below from this great answer got me thinking. I have reposted it from there.
