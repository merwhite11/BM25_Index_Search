Is it possible that the Rosetta orbiter moved the comet when it crashed?

Rosetta Comet Orbiter (RCO) crashed into the surface of a comet after the comet passed near Jupiter, which would be out-of-range for its antenna to communicate with Earth. So, the ESA made the difficult decision to just let go and crash the darn thing. (Talk about going out with a bang! geez!) Anyway, I saw a mission called DART wreck into an asteroid on purpose in order to move it. It got me thinking, did Rosetta do the same thing? The DART main spacecraft was about the size of a refrigerator, with 8-meter-wide solar arrays. Rosetta was an aluminum box with two solar panels that extended out like wings. The box, which weighed about 6,600 lbs. (3,000 kilograms), measured about 9 by 6.8 by 6.5 feet (2.8 by 2.1 by 2 meters). It has a wingspan on 105 feet. Given Rosetta is MUCH heavier than DART, was it possible to move the comet with Rosetta? There is a slight factor that could mean all the difference, Rosetta's target was bigger than DART's.
I state my question one last time, is it possible that the Rosetta Orbiter might have moved the comet it crashed into?
