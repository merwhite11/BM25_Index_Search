Are there viable explanations for the red shift of distant galaxies other than the accelerated expansion of the universe?

I was told that photons lose energy (= increase their wave length) when moving away from mass and gain energy moving towards mass.
Could this increased red shift of photons, originated a long time ago, come from the fact that they started in an old, dense universe and end up in a young, less dense universe?
