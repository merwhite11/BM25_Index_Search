Star identifier needed

Like other apps such as PeakVisor for identifying mountains, I was hoping there was an app with which I could upload a photo to identify stars in the night sky. I’m not finding one so thought I’d try here. This photo was taken at Eagle River Nature Center in Eagle River, Alaska at roughly 18:00 on December 17, 2022.
