Could Dark Energy be a "Cosmic Gravity Background"

Could dark energy (the accelerating expansion of the universe) be the result of gravity from the dense past universe "pulling" outward from all directions? The universe theoretically started out extremely dense and hot, and we can see the light reaching us as the cosmic microwave background. I wonder if that same region and denser portions beyond are exerting a gravitational effect that is stretching out everything within toward it, effectively being a cosmic gravity background. If so, is this the explanation for dark energy?
