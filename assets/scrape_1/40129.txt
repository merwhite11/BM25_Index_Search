If the Earth circled a red dwarf/giant or a brown dwarf, would its sky still look blue?

I have the impression that in brown dwarf and weak red dwarf systems, everything looks more reddish on a planet, including its atmosphere regardless of composition. Suppose there's a planet having an atmosphere at the same surface pressure and composition as that of Earth, circling either a brown dwarf or a below-average-luminous red dwarf at habitable distance, would this planet's atmosphere still look blue when seen from either the surface or outer space? Or would its atmosphere look more orange/red?
