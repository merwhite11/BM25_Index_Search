In the explanation of fitgeometry=general of drizzlepac.tweakreg.TweakReg, How are there two different rotation with respect to "x axis" and "y axis"?

While the shift file looks nearly identical to the prior run, 
this is because the axis-dependent rotation 
and scale values are averaged together in the shiftfile. 
To determine the actual values, it is necessary to inspect the logfile.

The above script is related to the axis explanation of fitgeometry=general of drizzlepac.tweakreg.TweakReg.
(and this is from DrizzlePac tutorial)
How are there two different rotation with respect to "x axis" and "y axis"?
In two-dimensional space, there is just one rotation with x-axis and y-axis separately, NOT two rotations.
