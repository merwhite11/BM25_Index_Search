how far away could we detect that Earth has life?

My guess is that life bearing planets are too far apart to be detected. I think we can only find the ones within a sphere around our planet that is 100s of light years in diameter but I suspect life bearing planets may be much farther away than that.  
I would like to estimate the diameter of the sphere within which we could detect life on another planet and then estimate the probability that there is life within that sphere. 
For example, give our current technology what is the furthest distance would be able to detect life on Earth? 
How many stars like our sun are in that sphere? 
How long would it take for SETI to rule out each of those stars?
