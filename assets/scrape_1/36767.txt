At the Big Bang, when everything was close together, why did it not "collide", violating Planck length or Pauli Exclusion Principle?

How could so much matter, or "all" in fact, have been concentrated in a smaller universe without being in the actual same place? Why did this not result in undercutting the Planck Length or violating the Pauli exclusion principle?
