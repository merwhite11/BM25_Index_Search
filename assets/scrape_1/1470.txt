What happens to the energy from a GRB?

A gamma ray burst produces somewhere around 1044 J of energy, according to Wikipedia. Only a small portion of that energy will be absorbed by other objects.
The rest of that energy will go on to travel the universe indefinitely I presume?
How do we know how much of the universes total mass-energy is in "in transit" in the form of gamma rays and other forms of radiation?
