Could Eris have a permanent atmosphere?

In Wikipedia they write that Eris has an atmosphere when around perihelion (close to the Sun) which collapses when Eris moves away from the Sun. So it behaves similar to a comet's tail. However, they thought the same of Pluto's atmosphere, and the information on Wikipedia is from prior to the New Horizons Pluto flyby which proved that Pluto has a permanent atmosphere.
Could they be wrong on Eris too or does Eris really go far enough from the Sun so that its atmosphere collapses? It is possible that they are right with Eris for its aphelion is about twice as far as Pluto's, but are we sure about its atmosphere?
