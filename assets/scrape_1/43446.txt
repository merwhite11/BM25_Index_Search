Did Cassini return a photo of Saturn's rings shown from closer to Saturn?

A quote from a book, Perelandra by C.S. Lewis: "no eye looked up from beneath on the Ring of Lurga"; now Lurga is Saturn, and no human eye has been to Saturn, let alone at a lower altitude than the rings, and quite probably would not survive the radiation exposure.
But we have an electronic eye; that is the camera, and on board Cassini were two cameras  and these have returned photos of marvelous views of Saturn. I tried a search to find if any photos were taken looking at the rings or otherwise showing the rings while Cassini orbited so close on its final orbits, but I found only artwork.
Were any such photos taken?
