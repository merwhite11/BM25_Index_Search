Calculating the expected lifespan for a binary system

Iâ€™m doing some research work on finding a correlation between the mass of binary stars and their lifespan. I have methods to find the mass, and that department seems to be going fine, but is there a way I can determine the lifespan of the star? If someone knows how to calculate the lifespan (in years) for a binary system that would be amazing. Additionally, I am open to applying the Chandrashekhar limit on a binary system, I would just appreciate a few pointers on how exactly to apply it. Finally, if someone has another metric for determining the lifespan of a star, I would be open to researching that as well. Any help for this topic is appreciated, but I must keep calculations for mass in my paper, anything else can be modified.
As per defining what "expected lifetime" is exactly, for detached binaries, it would be till one of the stars evolves into a neutron/white dwarf/ blackhole and eventually consumes the other star. For contact and semi-detached, I was thinking until they both collide.
Any help would be much appreciated!
