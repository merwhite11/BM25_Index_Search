What's the minimal argument I can give to reject The Geocentric Universe?

I'm new to Astrophysics, So pardon me if you find it silly to ask. I was just started reading about the basics of astrophysics. I read about the Greek Tradition, the concept of a geocentric universe. If I were asked in my childhood, to look at the sky and tell what do you think about the clockwork of the planet, I would have said that the Earth is at the center and everything moves around it as said by the greeks.
I read, How different peoples found difficulty explaining the motion through this Hypothesis. Though they were able to make some complicated models understand the wandering stars etc. And then Copernicus suggested a heliocentric model of planetary motion which is as believed, to make things simpler to make calculation simple. And So on...
It seems the things were based on more or less explaining the data by making an appropriate model and that's How science more or less works.
I want to know if there is some more basic argument that could be given to reject the Geocentric universe.
If not, Could there be some basic experiment that can be done to approve the Heliocentric Hypothesis and reject the other?

Edit: One more thing to add, Apart from the minimal argument, it would be great if the argument would remain valid at that time that is it should not contain any new information that wasn't known at that time.
