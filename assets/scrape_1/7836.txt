Why does Jupiter break comets apart?

I understand that there are magnificent tidal forces that come with getting too close to Jupiter, but what is causing comets like Shoemaker-Levy to get torn apart?  
I wouldn't expect that the gravitational forces are so strong that spaghetification occurs, is it?
