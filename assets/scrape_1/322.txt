Dark Matter Particle Candidates

Dark matter appears to dominate the matter component of the universe as compared to luminous, or baryonic, matter. Though it does not interact electromagnetically (it doesn't absorb, scatter, or emit photons), there is an ever-increasing mountain of evidence for its existence through it's gravitational interactions with stars, galaxies, and clusters, as well as it's influence on objects behind it through what's known as gravitational lensing. 
My question is, what are the most promising particle candidates of dark matter, and which experiments currently exist (or will exist) to attempt to answer this question?
