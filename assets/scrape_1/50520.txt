Will the universe eventually merge completely into a single, enormous BH

I see other similar questions, but mine is more specific: If total merger into one BH is the ultimate endgame,  then if the universe had no net angular momentum in the beginning, then wouldn't the final BH also have no spin?
So can Kerr BHs can become Schw BHs by merging with a Kerr BH of opposite angular momentum?
