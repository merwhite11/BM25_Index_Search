When were Swift and Voltaire discovered?

Deimos -- Mars' smallest moon -- has only two named features: the Swift crater and the Voltaire crater. Based on the Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, their names were approved in 1973.
Given the size of these craters, I assume they weren't discovered until the space age. Perhaps during a Mariner flyby? When were these craters first discovered?
