Length contraction of a star

Something moving toward or away from us will be contracted in length according to special relativity.
As the M31 galaxy is moving toward us at great speed it's "depth" should appear slightly flattened for us. A sphere moving toward us at the speed of light will appear "pancaked" in lack of a better word.
This was predicted by Lorentz and has been proven in experiments.
Does this also mean that electromagnetic radiation (light) from a flattened star is focused in the direction of motion relative to the observer?
