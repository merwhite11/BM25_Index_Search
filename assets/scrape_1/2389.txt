Faster Earth spinning speed to overcome gravity, possible?

As far as I know we stick to the surface of the Earth as its gravity is pulling us and Earth rotation is in a way reducing the gravity.
At what speed should Earth be spinning so that we all get ejected / catapulted into space (if we all line up on the equator).
Sub question: at what speed of spinning would we all “stick” a few meters above the ground?
