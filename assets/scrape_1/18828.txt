Travel telescope: attaching a Lunt 80mm ed on a Dolica tripod

I'm assembling a compact and light travel telescope. I'm going for the small Lunt 80mm ed refractor telescope mounted on a light Dolica tripod.  For those with this --or similar-- assembly, I would like to ask you how did you attach the Lunt to the Dolica. 
Thanks,
Marcelo
