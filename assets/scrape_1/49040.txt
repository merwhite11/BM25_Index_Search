Time & The Big Bang

What are the arguments against a perpetual universe, i.e. one that expands from a singularity, like we observe with ours, then suffers from terminal entropy, collapses back upon itself before reaching a new state of singularity, then experiences a new big bang? Wash, rinse, repeat for eternity.
It makes sense as a layman, but when I mention to others I'm told it's been refuted--yet I've never heard any actual refutations.
Thanks.
