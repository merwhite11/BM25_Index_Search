What is a Galactic Eclipse?

It is said that when our solar system passes through the dark rift of galaxy (what is it exactly?), a phenomenon named 'Galactic Eclipse' happens, when our solar system witnesses 3 days of darkness. Is it possible even in this case that there would be no light in the night sky, as there are many stars in the night sky. (don't consider city lights and other artificial human interference)
