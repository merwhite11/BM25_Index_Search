Are all space documentaries CGI?

Consider the following video by BBC about the Pillars of Creation:



According to a quick google search, the POC are 7000 light years away.
If we just had a picture of the POC from Hubble, and we zoom into that picture, that seems the most realistic to me.
However, in the video, it is as if the camera is actually going past clouds of gas, numerous stars, and even zooming into the POC. There is no break in the video. Every single frame is getting us closer to the POC.
How exactly is this done?
Hubble does not use film, but it's as if a very powerful film camera from Earth was able to manually zoom into the POC.
Unless its all CGI.
I understand this this one is CGI, as evident from the video title, but many space documentaries follow a similar approach to what I mentioned above
