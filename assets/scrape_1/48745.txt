Data of Coronal Holes

I'm working on the Evolution of coronal holes for which I need data of Coronal Holes, I have searched on internet and also done literature survey but didn't find out any open-source catalogue where I can download the data for Coronal Holes, In certain papers mentioned below

A statistical study of longâ€“term evolution of coronal hole
properties as observed by SDO
Statistical Analysis and Catalog of Non-polar Coronal Holes Covering
the SDO-Era Using CATCH

Some people have taken the data from Satellite (Solar Dynamic Observatory) and some have used the CATCH Software (It's user manual is not opening so can't download the CATCH-Collection of Analysis Tools for Coronal Holes software.


My question is that is there anyone out there who is working on Solar    parameters such as Coronal Holes and can provide me the data
of coronal holes from 21st    Solar cycle up to 25th Solar Cycle.
