Can a celestial body be tidally locked to multiple other bodies at the same time?

Could a planet be tidally locked to both the star it is orbiting and a moon orbiting the planet at the same time? I feel like it wouldn't be possible, because I think it would cause the moon to crash into the planet, but maybe there's a way for it to work?
