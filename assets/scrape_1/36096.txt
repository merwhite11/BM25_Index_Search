Is it possible to see Callisto with the naked eye when it's at its greatest elongation from Jupiter?

A quick search shows that Callisto has an apparent magntidue of 5.65, which would make it easily visible under relatively dark skies. Being the farthest Galilean moon, does it ever get far away from Jupiter for it to be discernable to the naked eye?
