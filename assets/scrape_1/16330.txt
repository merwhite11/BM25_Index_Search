Black holes and material interaction

I was wondering about what happens when a black hole forms.
I mean, a black hole forms when a star collapses, so when an enormous mass of protons, electrons, neutrons etc collapses together.
But when it does, all those particles should come "in contact", so what happens when electrons and protons come in contact?
Shouldn't they annihilate each other releasing energy?
In the end, shouldn't the singularity be composed only by the mass of particles without an electrical charge?
I'm not a professional, I just find astronomy fascinating and I like to read about it, so forgive me if I said something obviously wrong :)
