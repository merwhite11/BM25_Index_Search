Why doesn't this paradox disprove (some) multiverse quantum gravitational theories?

As I understand it, one theory of the multiverse is that there are an infinite number of universes separated by small distances in other (than our observable 3/4) dimensions and that gravity is weak because it permeates these other dimensions.
But if there are an infinite number of these universes then surely the gravitational force we would feel would be infinite?
