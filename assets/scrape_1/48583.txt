Pressure and chemical potential of quantum Schwarzschild black hole

Just as Stephen Hawking showed that even Schwarzschild black holes have a temperature, shouldn't it also have a pressure and chemical potential? Are there any analytical formulae of those as well as
$$ T_{BH}=\dfrac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi GMk_B}?$$
Since the analogy with thermodynamics should be complete (the 4 laws of BH are analogues to those of thermodynamics), if you write: $\def\d{\mathrm{d}}\d E=T\d S-p\d V+Î¼\d N$, and since (quantum) black holes have entropy (area), and temperature (surface gravity), one should ask naturally what is the (quantum) pressure and the chemical potential equivalents, even in Schwarzschild black holes. It has volume so it should have a pressure,... However, the chemical potential part is much more intriguing since, indeed, we do not know what BH constituents truly are. Also, even with uncharged black holes, shouldn't we have a chemical term due to e.g. the cosmological constant? What about the NUT "charge" terms?
I guess for the pressure (energy density) of Schwarzschild black holes this quantity:
$$P_S=\dfrac{E_S}{V_S}=\dfrac{k_BT_{BH}}{\dfrac{4\pi}{3}\left(\dfrac{2GM}{c^2}\right)^3}=\dfrac{3\hbar c^9}{256\pi^2G^4M_\odot^4}\left(\dfrac{M_\odot}{M}\right)^4 \approx 8\cdot 10^{-42}\left(\dfrac{M_\odot}{M}\right)^4\;\; Pa$$
However I am not sure if it is meaningful and how to guess the chemical potential (if any) for (quantum) Schwarzschild black holes... Has it any sense or not?
