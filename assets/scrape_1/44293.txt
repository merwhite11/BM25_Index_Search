Would a possible accretion disk around a primordial black hole 500 au from the Sun be visible in present telescopes?

If the hypothetical two-inch black hole 500 au from the Sun had an accretion disk, might current telescopes detect it already or do we have to wait till the Vera Rubin Observatory starts work?
