Why is one picture of this star blue with red, and the other red with blue?

Someone just retweeted a NASA tweet onto my timeline, and it includes two images, allegedly from the same star that was in the process of dying, taken by the new space telescope, side by side:

I don't quite understand what I'm looking at though. If I understood correctly, these are two images of the same star. But, both have different colour schemes. I know stars can change 'colour' based on their type and life cycle (like blue dwarf, red dwarf), but I doubt that's what I'm looking at as the telescope is relatively new and from what I understand, those life cycles take ages.
The other option that comes to my mind is some kind of artistic freedom, like what is done when artists make images of e.g. dinosaurs and guess their colors. But that seems a bit too unscientific for NASA, so I'm expecting there to be a good reason for the difference in color here.
If this is the same star, why is the picture on the left blue with red, and the one on the right red with blue?
