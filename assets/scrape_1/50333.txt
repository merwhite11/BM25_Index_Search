Lunar Librations and Subsolar Point in Matlab

So I have been trying to write a program to generate the latitude and longitude of the lunar subsolar point in Matlab.
I have the ephemeris data from aero toolbox, but I can't seem to get values that make sense.
The method I'm currently trying (without success) is...

Generate a juliandate for a specific time
Find the position of the sun relative to the moon from the ephemeris data for the specified date
Find the (φ, θ, ψ) lunar attitude from the ephemeris data
Create a rotational matrix from the lunar attitude values
Transpose the matrix to get the inverse rotation (to convert the vector from the ICRF frame to the moon's coordinate system)
Apply that rotation to the direction of the sun vector
Convert to spherical coordinates (longitude, latitude)

mission_time = juliandate(2022, 1, 1);
sun_pos = planetEphemeris(mission_time, 'Moon', 'Sun');
moon_rot = moonLibration(mission_time);

rotm = eul2rotm(moon_rot);
rotm = transpose(rotm);

sun_vec = sun_pos / norm(sun_pos);
sun_vec = sun_vec * rotm;

[ss_long, ss_lat] = cart2sph(sun_vec(1), sun_vec(2), sun_vec(3))
fprintf("Subsolar Lat: %2.2f°\tSubsolar Long: %2.2f°\n", rad2deg(ss_long), rad2deg(ss_lat))

The subsolar latitude should be like ±1.57° but this calculation goes all over the place. What am I missing?
