How Are Radioactive Decay Rates Influenced by Neutrinos - On Earth and Other Dense Planets

I read a science report recently that mentioned an accidental discovery where radioactive decay rates shifted slightly slower in advance ( about a day and a half) of solar storms or in sync with sun's 33-day pattern/rotation of the sun's core. Seems that neutrinos emitted from within the sun or at surface of the sun arrive in advance of other wave/particle radiations AND effect earthly atomic natures.
Aside from predicting solar flares/storms, does this imply decaying atoms/elements absorb or block neutrino emissions to any substantial degree that might of use in other areas of science?
