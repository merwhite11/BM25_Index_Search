Could there be a planet at the barycenter between two or more stars revolving around each other?

In binary star systems, could there be a planet the stars revolve around, with eternal day on all sides?
1st scenario: Imagine a binary system consisting of two Sunlike G5V stars of 1 solar mass each, orbiting each other, and at the barycenter between them is a planet (which would make the planet itself revolve at the same horizontal speed around its axis, making each sun appear always above the same location on the planet). If the stars revolved around the planet both sides would be illuminated similarly. I don't see why it should be impossible. A planet that once was the outermost one in orbit around one of the stars got ejected from its orbit by the other star's gravity, migrating into the barycenter between them.
2nd scenario: Imagine there's a planet at the Lagrangian point between Alpha Centauri A and B. If the stars revolved around the planet both sides would be illuminated similarly. Would that be possible?
Do situations like those above occur or was such even observed?
