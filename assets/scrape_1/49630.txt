Why are the sky distributions of SDSS DR16 and DR16Q different?

I've downloaded the csv files for SDSS DR16 and DR16Q and made a map of their sky distributions:

The coordinates come from:

DR16: RA_ICRS and DE_ICRS
DR16Q: RAJ2000 and DEJ2000

Why do they overlap only partly? Isn't DR16Q a subset of DR16?
