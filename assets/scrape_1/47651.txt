How did the Universe climb out of its own Big Bang black hole?

The Big Bang started as a singularity. That means small. All the matter in the universe was in a volume smaller than its own Schwarzchild radius. The universe was inside a black hole.
At present, the universe is big: bigger than its Schwarzchild radius. It got out of its own black hole which, they tell me, canâ€™t be done.
How did this happen?
