How does the Sky in Google Earth Pro work?

For those who don't know, Google Earth Pro has a feature where you can see what the sky should look like based on the time and geographical location. 
I know Google Sky says that Google Earth uses their information, is there any way that I could access this through an API?
If that isn't possible, do y'all know of any related databases that reveal how the sky would look at night? (Emphasis on how the sky would look here, I know there are things like the Yale Bright Star Catalouge, but it doesn't tell me where the milky way would appear in the sky).
