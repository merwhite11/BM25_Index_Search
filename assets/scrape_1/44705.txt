If a black hole is spinning, does its singularity have a new name and what is the name?

Think of a spinning black hole. (Kerr black hole)
Every black hole has a point of infinite density, called a singularity.
When a singularity is spinning, does it have a different name?
But when a point is spinning, it is still a point... So does it have a new name???
