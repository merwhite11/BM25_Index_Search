In the milky way which star(s) are farthest from galactic plane?

I am looking for at least one star on each of the side of the galactic plane. I understand there would be an error tolerance. So, please do not hesitate if the answer is not exact.  Preferably, please refer to a paper. I searched on the internet and only found the farthest stars from the earth.
By "in the milky way" I mean any star that rotates around the center of the milky way. Among (stars of) satellite galaxies of milky-way, the confirmed galaxies that are rotating around milky-way exclusively are included.
