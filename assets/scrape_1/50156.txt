What could be an explanation for a satellite-like moving light in the night sky that dims over time

Last night I saw a bright light moving across the sky. It was probably as bright (or even brighter) than some of the brightest visible stars like Vega and moving  quite slowly (so no shooting star) at roughly the speed satellites appear to move. I was quite surprised to see a satellite that bright but I was pretty certain that it couldn't be the ISS because of the position and direction in the sky.
However, from the moment that I spotted it it continuously dimmed until it wasn't anymore visible to the naked eye - maybe 5-10 seconds and 30Â° of movement later.
