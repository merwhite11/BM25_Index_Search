Waning gibbus moon tilt

Can anyone explain why on the 14 Oct 2022 at 7.00 UTC at location (Lat 52.339 Long 0.419)does the waning gibbous moon (Alt 39ยบ) appear to be illuminated from a different direction, i.e. slightly upwards, than from the sun which is only at Alt 5ยบ? The azimuth difference is 149.83ยบ.
