Is Neowise viewable from my position?

I have had an impossible time trying to locate this comet. My lat/long is 38.3/-82.4. My elevation is 705ft.
The application that I'm using shows me exactly where Neowise is supposed to be (North East, best viewed before sunrise around 4:00am, etc.), but I've managed to not locate it once in the last three days at that time. Stayed out for an hour straight each time, starting at 4:00am.
Is it not viewable from my position?
