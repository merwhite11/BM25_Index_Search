2017 Eclipse intersection with I-95

I am excited to see the 2017 eclipse in South Carolina and would like to understand where exactly the eclipse-path intersects I-95, so that I can plan a day-trip.
I have approximated at roughly Santee,SC, but would really like to overlay and pinpoint the eclipse-path intersection with I-95 in Google maps (blue line in .kml file).  Unfortunately, the KML file does not show I-95

Hasn't someone already done this with the web version with Google maps?
Is there a simple process to either embed I-95 in the Google Earth .kml or 
Command Google Earth to overlay the blue eclipse path over the internet connected map data?

I was able to plot Santee, SC (on I-95) on the .kml file:

Any edits to sharpen or clarify questions are appreciated.  I pose this question to the astronomy community because I think that someone has already done this.  See you at the eclipse!
