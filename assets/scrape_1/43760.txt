Would a future Dyson sphere or swarm around our Sun actually be beneficial to people on Earth?

A Dyson sphere or swarm's function is to harvests most of a star's energy, correct?
However, a future Dyson sphere around our Sun would also block the Sun's rays from reaching Earth. Wouldn't it freeze the people on Earth to death and ruin the bio-sphere?
Or is there some way around that?
