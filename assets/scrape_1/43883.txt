Searching for a modern AGN Catalog

I am searching for a simple, modern catalog of Active Galactic Nuclei. I expected a catalog similar to this or this, but instead found that they contain observed spectra instead of properties like the mass, luminosity, SMBH mass, etc (take SDSS for example).
So, my question is, Is there any modern catalog of AGN and their properties?
