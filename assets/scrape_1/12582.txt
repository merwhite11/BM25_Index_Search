Diameter of Astronomical Object Using Magnification

I took a picture of Jupiter through my telescope, using an iPhone. I know the magnification of the telescope lens I used, and can Google to get the magnification of the iPhone lens (the magnification without zooming). Using a standard Photo Editor, I also know the pixels across of Jupiter in my image.
Can I, using all of this information above, calculate how many kilometres one pixel represents, and consequently the diameter of Jupiter?
