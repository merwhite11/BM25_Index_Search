Why is gravity constrained to speed of light of gravity itself affects space time?

Gravity(gravitational waves)they say travels at the speed of light. But speed is distance/time. If gravity affects space-time or “time” then how can we be sure that gravity indeed travels with a quantity that gets affected by itself ?
