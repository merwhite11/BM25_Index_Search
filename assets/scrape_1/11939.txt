Is our Universe a hologram?

I watched a documentary where I heard some very strange theories that are difficult for me to comprehend. It is even difficult for me to explain what I heard. "Objects that fall into a black hole leave a copy of themselves outside the black hole." "We are not living in reality but in a hologram ." Does any of this make any sense to anyone ? O.K. so I went to check the title of this documentary because how can anyone explain it without knowing what I saw. "Fingerprints of God -the Dark Universe" this is the title. I do admit that I did sleep through a good part of it because it was almost 2:00 a.m. Also if anyone wants to watch it then look for it on youtube because that is where I saw it.
