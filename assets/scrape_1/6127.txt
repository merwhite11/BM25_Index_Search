Potential Re-Capture of Rogue Planets

Rogue planets can be designated as rogue planets due to one of two possible scenarios: 1) the "rogue planet" formed as a sub-brown dwarf, or 2) the planet was ejected from its home star system. I want to make it clear that here, I'm interested in objects of the second category - objects that are similar to the planets we find in our solar system.
Could a rogue planet, having been ejected from its home star system, be gravitationally re-captured by another star system? If so, would it be likely to disrupt other bodies in the stellar system (I know this depends on size; let's say that the rogue planet is a "Hot Jupiter")?
I realize that we don't know a whole lot about these objects (let's face it, we only know of a handful), so I'm not looking for examples, but any logical answers would be pretty helpful.
