Can we measure planetary Love number of exoplanets?

I understand that Love number is the ratio between the tide raising potential to the actual deformation of the body, however, I'm not sure if there are ways to detect the Love number from observations outside our solar system. If there are ways, I would like to know the basic theory behind it.
