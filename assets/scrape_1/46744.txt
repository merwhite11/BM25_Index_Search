Will the James Webb Space Telescope be visible from earth?

Once the JWST is in orbit around L2, would it be possible to view it using any ground based telescopes? I’m mostly thinking of equipment available to amateurs, since I don’t have a 10m reflector. But would this be feasible for anything we have built or could build on the ground?
