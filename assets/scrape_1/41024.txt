Do we know what's "behind the Milky Way"?

If we do, how? And what are those objects on the other side of the galactic center?
We can't see through the dense band of light and dust, but maybe in other spectrums the band is much less dense? But I doubt it.
Maybe we could detect or have detected those galaxies/satellites through their center's strong X-Ray? Or through their gravitational force on the Milky Way?
If not, then there is a chance, that there is a closer galaxy than Andromeda and even more satellite galaxies than currently observed?
Thanks in advance! :)
