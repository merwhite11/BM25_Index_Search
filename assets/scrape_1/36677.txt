Can expansion of space cause the motion of galaxies, does expansion of space do effect motion of our sun around center and earth around Sun?

I'm just wondering that expansion is anyway related to in effecting motion of a star under the galaxies ? Planets are currently revolving around sun in helix motion, if galaxies has motion as well reason to expansion of space then it is possible that, that can effect anyway on that planetary motion around stars ?
