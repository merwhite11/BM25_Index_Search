Dataset for machine learning MK stellar classification

I would like to create program for automatic Morgan-Keenan stellar classification using machine learning. For that, I need dataset of stars with known absolute magnitude, temperature and luminosity type (0, Ia, Ib, ..., VII). I found some datasets, (e. g. kaggle.com), however they contain only few hundreds stars and not all star types are represented.
Is there any large enough dataset (at least 1000 stars) in which all types of stars are represented, from hypergiants to dwarfs, and with all the information mentioned?
