Milky Way as seen by the human eye: where exactly do those photons come from?

I'm asking here about the diffuse glow seen by the human eye, when looking at the Milky Way.
Where do those visible photons come from exactly?

the surface of a star?
starlight bouncing off something (dust or a molecule)?
emitted by gas in the interstellar medium?
all of the above?
