Is Venus in our sun's habitable zone?

I know that Venus is closer to the sun than Earth and if an article I read is to be believed, Venus is hotter than Mercury even though the latter is closer to the Sun. The explanation for this odd phenomenon is, per some scientists, runaway greenhouse effect (the CO2 content of Venus' atmosphere is very high).
It's safe to say that Venus would've been cooler without so much CO2 in its atmosphere. Question is would it be as cool as Earth to allow liquid water to exist if only there wasn't so much CO2 in its atmosphere? Is Venus in our sun's habitable/Goldilocks zone?
