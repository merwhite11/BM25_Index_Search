Do black holes "store" ancient light?

The way I understand it, black holes have extreme gravity, and time moves more slowly in high gravity.
For outside observers, it would seem that time would stop at the event horizon.
Does this mean that light which was traveling towards the star at the time of the gravitational collapse would possibly get "stuck" near the event horizon, for possibly billions of years?
If that is the case, would it then be possible to examine such light (if it doesn't spiral into the black hole) to examine the early universe?
