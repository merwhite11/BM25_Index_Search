How can many stars be formed from the remains of one supernova?

A supernova is the explosion of a single star; so how is it that thousands of stars can "be born of" that one explosion (presumably only using the unspent fuel / lighter elements of the original)? Does that also mean the stars coming from a supernova cannot possibly become supernovae themselves?
For example, according to Wikipedia, the Rosetta Nebula has about 2500 including a couple of O-type stars!

approximately 2500 young stars lie in this star-forming complex, including the massive O-type stars HD 46223 and HD 46150


Edit to reduce confusion and risk of reinforcing my false premised path of questioning: I somehow had the idea that nebulae came from single supernova explosions and that all nebulae were planetary nebulae. After research, that was an absurd understanding on multiple levels.
