Why is WISE J0521+1025's distance so uncertain?

If you look at the Wikipedia page List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs
, you'll notice that all stars mentioned in the list have a very precise value; all are $\pm0.02$ ly (except for GJ 1005, but it is still within 1 ly)
Even though WISE J0521+1025 is within 5 parsecs of Earth, its uncertainty is 1.3 parsecs (4.3 ly)! What is going on here, and why is the distance so inaccurate?
