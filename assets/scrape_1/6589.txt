Do black holes have energy?

So black holes are created by certain dying stars and when the star runs out of nuclear energy gravity wins out and the star implodes. An entire starâ€™s mass collapses down into a smaller and smaller volume of space. Which then creates a black hole, so my question is, do black holes actually have energy to create that type of vacuum to suck light in?
If a black hole was created by a huge star running out of fuel and then collapsing in on it self, would the black hole have energy and if so where would it come from, or is it just like the vacuum in space with no energy at all?
(Please correct me if I said anything wrong about the black holes as I am very young and don't quiet grasp the concept of it yet.)
