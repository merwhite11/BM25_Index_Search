How do you calculate comoving distance and light's travel distance? According to the formulae below?

According to Wikipedia, Distance measures (cosmology),
Comoving distance:
$${\displaystyle d_{C}(z)=d_{H}\int _{0}^{z}{\frac {dz'}{E(z')}}}$$
Light-travel distance:
$${\displaystyle d_{T}(z)=d_{H}\int _{0}^{z}{\frac {dz'}{(1+z')E(z')}}}$$
What is with the 'Hubble distance' ($d_H$) before the integration symbol?  Do you multiply it by the result of integration?
Also, how do you take the derivative of $z$, $z'$, if $z$ is a constant? $z$ is the (current) redshift for that particular object, right?
I am confused....
From 'Distance measures (cosmology)' on Wikipedia:

Is there an example on the web somewhere of these two things, comoving and travel distance, being calculated?  That might help....
