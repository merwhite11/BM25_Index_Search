Is dark matter made from the particles that had charge but no mass in the early part of the Big Bang

It is assumed that massless charged  particles acquired mass after the early phase of the Big Bang. But could most charged particles be massless now as dark matter. They wouldn't interact with photons or electrons electromagnetically because electrons have mass and charge and photons are charge less massless Neither are charged massless
