Are there celestial bodies that are about as far away as the Sun?

Just curious. The Sun is 500 light seconds away from the Earth depending on time of the year. The orbit of Mars is about 50% as far as the Sun, the orbit of Vesta about 150%. Is there / Are there celestial bodies inbetween with about the distance of the Sun, their orbit around 93 million miles far from the Earth?
