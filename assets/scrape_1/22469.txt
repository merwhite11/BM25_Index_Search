If an asteroid was to collide with Earth, how much warning would we have?

I was talking to my 9-year-old son about the Florence asteroid that is passing close to the earth. He wanted to view youtube videos about that asteroids, and we saw the starting of this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxMbkrNbcg and when I realized that the title video has 2036 as the year in which an asteroid crashes into the Earth. I explained that that was science fiction (like Back to the future) and only an animation
He asked me: "If an asteroid or similar object was to collide with the Earth,.... how many years or months before the crash occurs would the scientific community know?"
I suppose that the advance time depends on technology, so assume the current level of technology.
