What is the current accepted theory as to why Mercury, despite its size, has a similar density to Earth?

According to the NASA web page overview about Mercury, despite the planet being just a bit larger than our moon, it's density is about 98.4% of Earth's.  This high density suggests a comparatively large iron core (compared to the rest of the planet).
Recent studies reported in "NASA Antenna Cuts Mercury to Core, Solves 30 Year Mystery" (NASA, 2007) have confirmed the presence of a molten core, surrounded by a silicate mantle (depicted in the illustration below (from the article):

The question is then, what is the current accepted theory as to Mercury has a still-molten core and a density like that of Earth?
