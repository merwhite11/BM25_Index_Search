Is the Earth Really Spinning? (honest question)

Most people consider it common knowledge that the Sun's "movement" in the sky is only perceived due to the Earth's "spin and movement".
Based on this, you'd think that the stars in the night sky (when viewed with time lapse photography) would take a path in the sky similar to the sun. After all, both the sun and stars are practically stationary over the course of one day, given their accepted distances from the earth.
Yet, time lapse photography shows this is not the case.
Compare these photos:
1) Time Lapse of Sun
2) Time Lapse of Stars
3) Time Lapse of Moon
If the Earth's spin is the primary reason for "movement" of things (farther than clouds in the sky), then why do the sun and moon move through the sky in a similar fashion that is totally different from the sky-path of the stars? The Earth is said to spin around 360 degrees every 24 hours. It seems to me that everything in the sky should move in one direction where I live (Texas).
To me (in Texas), it seems the stars should sweep from horizon to horizon over the course of the Earth's night-spin (like the sun and moon do). Yet, the time lapse photos show circular paths in the sky for the stars. That would make sense at the poles, but not in Texas!?
