Is the dark side of the earth protected from the risks of solar flares?

Many speculate about the possibility of another “Carrington event”. Without getting into unrealistic scenarios, I ask myself the following question: would electronic lines and the equipment connected to them be safe if a large CME occurred, say, between 2am and 3am?
It would seem logical that a region that is not exposed to the sun at the time of the CME would be safe, but on the other hand, auroras occur at night, suggesting that solar flares do not just impact the daytime side of the earth.
