If we replaced the Moon with Ceres, how close would Ceres have to orbit to cause the same tides?

How close to Earth would Ceres have to be to cause tides of the same strength as by the Moon, above the region it orbits? Ceres has 1.3% the Moon's mass, but that doesn't mean it must be at 1.3% the Moon's distance, right? Is it even possible for Ceres or is Ceres too low-mass to cause similar tides?
