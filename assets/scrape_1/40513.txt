Does a replacement exist for Dexter? (A tool that reconstructs data from a pdf of a graph)

Dexter was a tool from the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory, made by the Center for Astronomy of Heidelberg University (ZAH). It was able to reconstruct data from a graph if you provided a pdf or an image of that graph. It relied on Java, and since browsers have stopped support for Java it no longer works.

Does anyone know of another tool that does the same thing?
Thanks
