Are there any new/latest/recent radio sky surveys' data release which is publicly accessible?

There are many sky surveys that have been conducted by telescopes in different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum like DSS (Digitized Sky Survey), SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), WISE (wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer,), Fermi, VLA North, etc.
I am currently working on a project in the field of radio astronomy and would like access to the recent and latest images of any radio sky surveys/telescopes (preferably post-year 2000). VLAF and NVSS have great resolution and sensitivity respectively. Also, RACS and LoTSS have superb resolution and sensitivity.
However, I am unaware of any new radio sky surveys that have been happening or new data releases of any of the radio telescopes. Also, if they are publicly accessible?
