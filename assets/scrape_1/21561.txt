How to compare a reflector telescope to a refractor one?

I already have a small 60mm Tasco refractor (with 300mm focal lenght) and a homemade 40mm refractor (with 1300mm focal lenght) and I want to buy a new telescope to have a better experience (I don't have an EQ mount yet)
I face the current choice: for the same price, I can have a 70mm refractor (900mm fl) with a great EQ mount, or a 114mm reflector (900mm fl) with a less great EQ mount...
How can I compare those 2 two? They are not the same type, and I feel like comparing oranges with apples. 
I know the technical difference between them, and I know the details about collimation. I just don't know how to rate them and chose one.
In short: Is it better a big reflector or a small refractor?
(If I want to extend the information to other choices I might encounter)
