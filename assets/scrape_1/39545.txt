What percentage of Earth-sized planets in a habitable zone can be detected by the radial velocity method?

What percentage of Earth-sized planets in a habitable zone can be detected by the radial velocity method?
I understand that larger planets and closer planets are detected more easily; and I assume that if a planet is in a circular orbit whose plane is nearly perpendicular to our line of sight, that the Doppler method won't be able to detect wobble of the star.
This question goes along with, but is of course different from, this question; but some of the factors like planet size and orbital radius enter in the same way, while the size of the star would enter in the opposite way.
