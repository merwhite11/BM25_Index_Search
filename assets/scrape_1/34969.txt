How does gravity affect a physical clock?

In all the explanations for time dilation and how gravity affects time a common example which is used is "Clock near to the ground will tick away faster than clock away from the ground due to gravity".
But what exactly does this mean ? How does a regular clock gets affected by gravity, does the second hand slows down ?
If it has to do something with gravity affecting the inner working of wind up and pendulum clock will this also affect digital clock ?
