What is the difference between aurorae and electroglow?

One of the discoveries of Voyager 2 at Uranus was a phenomenon called "electroglow", which as I understand it is related to charged particles interacting with the atmosphere that cause the emission of ultraviolet radiation. What I am not clear on is how this process is different to the production of aurorae. Is there some clear difference between the two processes that allows them to be distinguished?
