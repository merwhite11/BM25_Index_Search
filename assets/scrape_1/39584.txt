What "long chain of carbon chemistry" in the interstellar medium produces cyclopropenylidene? (C3H2)

Wikipedia's Cyclopropenylidene; Titan (Moon of Saturn); Formationsays:

The major formation reaction of c-C3H2 is the dissociative recombination of c-C3H3+.
C3H3+ + e− → C3H2 + H
c-C3H3+ is a product of a long chain of carbon chemistry that occurs in the ISM.

From that I conclude that Cyclopropenylidene in the ISM (interstellar medium) is also a product of a long chain of carbon chemistry.

note: While Detection of Cyclopropenylidene on Titan with ALMA is interesting news, my question is about the ISM, not (necessarily at least) Titan's upper atmosphere.
