Is Rosetta changing the theory of comets?

Rosetta is now arriving at Comet 67P. 
Other comets have been analyzed to some degree (Giotto, Deep Space 1, Deep Impact, etc.)
So my question is... where I can study the up-to-date theory of comets? Much of what was previously thought (eg. dirty snowball) has been discarded now, but I haven't found a good source describing the current thinking. 
Are there any firm predictions that will be tested as Rosetta studies the comet up close?
