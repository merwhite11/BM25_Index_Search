Where are the two recently confirmed unusual brown dwarfs?

The News report of two confirmed unusual T-type brown dwarfs but they don't tell where in space or on the night sky they were found or how far they are from the Earth/Sun. The brown dwarfs are WISE 0414 and WISE 1810. Does anyone know where they are located?
