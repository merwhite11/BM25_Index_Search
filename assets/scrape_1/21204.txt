I see a non flickering star. How is this possible?

I looked outside my window one night, and the moon was shining brightly, and it wasn't a full moon. But thats not the point. Really close to it was something that looked liked a star. It was really bright, and it gave off a white light, but the more I looked at it, the more I realized that it wasn't flickering or twinkling the way stars do. A few minutes later, I looked at it again, and this time it was smaller, less bright, and farther away from the moon. I know its not a satalite because I've seen those before and they move faster, and they give off the same amount of light all the time. If anyone has any idea what this thing could be, please tell me, because I really want to know.
