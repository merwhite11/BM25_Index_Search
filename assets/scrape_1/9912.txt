Why does radio astronomy offer higher resolution images than optical?

According to this lecture,"Radio astronomy has several advantages over optical astronomy...We can make the highest resolution images, and see things happening on the smallest scales."
Why is this? If resolving power, $r \propto \frac{\lambda}{B}$ then shouldn't shorter wavelength light result in smaller angular resolution i.e. better resolution?
