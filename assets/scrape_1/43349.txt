How massive does a moon have to be to have a stable magnetic field?

Is there a minimum mass or other minimum properties necessary for a body to have a strong, stable dynamo to create a magnetic field conducive for life?
For example, would it be possible for Titan to have a magnetic field if it had different core characteristics?
