Betelgeuse appears in a rainbow of colors through a Newtonian telescope

My husband and I are complete amateurs. Tonight was only our second night using our new Orion XT6 Dobsonian telescope. Betelgeuse looked very clear, bright red. However, when we pointed the telescope at it, it appeared in a pulsing bright rainbow of colors.
What did we see? Our telescope is a reflecting telescope, so we didn't expect chromatic abberation. Did we manage to see the rainbow nebula around Betelgeuse? Or, did this have something to do with light pollution, which was pretty bad in that part of the sky?
Location: the Netherlands
Telescope: 6" Dobsonian, 25 mm eye piece
