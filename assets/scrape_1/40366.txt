Observatories that allow public access

Are there any observatories with high powered telescopes that also allow public access?
Astronomy is a VERY expensive addiction, because no matter what telescope you get, you always want the next model up.   If we can find an observatory that allows the public to see through their scope in America or Canada, we can make our vacation plans accordingly.  Kids want to see Pluto.  Scopes that powerful are "slightly" over our budget.
