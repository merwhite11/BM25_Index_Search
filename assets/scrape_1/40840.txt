Is it at all possible for the sun to revolve around as many barycenters as we have planets in our solar system?

Though it is understandable that the sun and the earth may be revolving around a barycenter, but, if so, not only the sun and Jupiter should also be revolving around some barycenter, the same should be true about the other planets as well? So it has to be true that the sun revolves around as many barycentres as the number of the planets we have in our solar system. I am quite confounded â€” how any object may at all revolve around multiple barycenters? And if an object can't revolve around more than one point, does it not nullify the theory that the sun and the earth revolve around a barycenter?
