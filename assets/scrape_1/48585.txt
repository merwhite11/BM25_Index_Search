Daylight hours on Titan?

I still cannot seem to wrap my head around Titan's day and night based off of math. From what I understand, Titan has a day of 16 earth days (384 hours) in which it circles Saturn once (its day and also 1-year orbit around Saturn). But during one full day would we see only one sunrise and sunset per day (with length of sunlight increasing/decreasing with the seasons as we have on earth) and then another sunrise and sunset (daily?) as Saturn blocks the sun casting Titan into complete darkness and then dawn as it peeks out from the other side again?
