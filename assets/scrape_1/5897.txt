How to compare a Catadioptrics light asorbtion with a reflector?

I used to have a 6" Dobsonian reflector, and the next telescope I buy, I want it to have the equivlant of about a 11/12" dobsonian reflector.
I'm looking at this Nexstar VX 9.25 , it says 235mm aperature, but is thats more than what a 235mm reflector would acheive right? How close is to a 11/12" reflector?
