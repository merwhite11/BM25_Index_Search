What was this "light" that looked like a star moving repeating from point A to B for about 5 mins

I was looking in the sky one night about 9:45. There was what looked to be a shooting star but much slower and brighter more like a satellite. It was moving (from standing on earth) it looked like a couple of feet. It would then disappear for about 10-15 seconds and reappear from the original spot it started from and do the exact thing as described before.tried to take pictures but it wouldn't show .from point A to point B then back to point A 10 seconds later after disappearing
