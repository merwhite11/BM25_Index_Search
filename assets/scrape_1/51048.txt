Deepest known objects in the vicinity of Capella (or, generally, any specified object)

There must be a way to do this, but I don’t know where to start.
Given a star (or other object, or a RA and dec), and a radius, what are the (say) 10 known deepest sky objects in this area, ordered from farthest to closest (with estimates of their distances)?
Currently interested in the area between Capella and “the kids” (eta, zeta, and epsilon aurigae). See attached.
Thanks.
