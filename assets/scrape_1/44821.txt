How to locate helpful and instructive books and resources about numerical methods in cosmology?

I am interested in the hydrodynamical and N-body simulations, and I want to use simulation results to examine the theoretical models.
Hence I am searching for some helpful and instructive books and lectures for learning relevant numerical methods, such as:

cloud-in-cell interpolation scheme
the process of calculating the power spectrum
data visualization

and similar. How might I best find resources like these?
