What if you 'placed' the Chicxulub asteroid onto the Earth?

We all know what sort of devastating impact an asteroid could have if it collided with the Earth.
But I'm curious to know what the effects would be if you removed the speed element from it, and were somehow able to casually 'place' a giant asteroid onto our planet?
I think I read somewhere that the Chicxulub asteroid was most likely around 9 miles long, and that the end of it would have extended beyond our atmosphere if it hit the Earth lengthways.
But would this have any effect if it was travelling at, say, 2mph? There would be nothing burning in the atmosphere or shockwaves etc.
Would it have any affect at all apart from squashing whatever was underneath?
If the answer is no... how about placing a moon-sized object onto the Earth?
