How much real time was compressed into this 10 second long timelapse Hubble video of Jupiter's aurora?

The HubbleESA video Timelapse of Jupiter’s auroras is discussed in the ESAHubble page Timelapse of Jupiter’s auroras and includes the identifier heic1613a. However there's no clear information there about the period of observation.
Note that there is also the page heic1613 — Photo Release
Hubble captures vivid auroras in Jupiter’s atmosphere
Question: How much real time was compressed into this 10 second long timelapse Hubble video of Jupiter's aurora? Were the original images taken over a period of minutes, hours, or days?
I don't notice any breaks, and I think that Jupiter will always be eclipsed by Earth seen from Hubble's low Earth orbit.
