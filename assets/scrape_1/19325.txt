What is direction of Sun's axis of rotation relative to the Earth's orbital plane around the Sun?

The present northern direction to the nearest 0.5 degrees with degree zero being the start of January and measured counterclockwise (same as Earth's orbit relative to celestial north pole). 
If the assumptions below do not allow a precision of 0.5 degrees then I imagine this question is unanswerable without specifying a specific date and time, in which case the specific date and time would be 1 January 2017, 00:00:00 hours.
Assumptions: (1) That the Earth's orbit around the sun is a perfect circle (I know it's very slightly elliptical but intuitively imagine that won't significantly affect the precision I need). (2) That the Sun's center is at the center of Earth's circular orbit (I know the Sun's center isn't exactly but don't imagine that will affect the accuracy I need either).
Note 1: I've found three general answers from three different sites, but, two of them appear to me to conflict and the other is too imprecise.
Note 2: This is my first post to this site and I did not plow through the hundreds of questions related to these tags. So if this question has already 
been answered I apologize and please be merciful and point me in right direction. 
Thank you
