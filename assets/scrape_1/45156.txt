Can a terrestrial planet orbit an icy planet (or vice versa)?

I know that the composition of planets is dependant on the equilibrium temperature at its orbit - for example, if below a certain temperature, water and other volatiles become solid, allowing them to accrete to form an ice planet or ice giant.
Is it possible for such an ice planet to be orbited by a moon of a different composition?
