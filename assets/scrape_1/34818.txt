How did the amount of nuclide produced by s- and r-process changed over time?

For a exercise I need to find out how the amount of nuclide produced by s- and r-process changed over time and I also need to draw a schematic diagram of the s-/r-ratio vs. time from 13.6 Ga till today and explain my reasoning. I searched for an answer in my lecture notes and also the lecture but I can't find a solution for this problem. Can somebody help me out where I could find an answer for this?
