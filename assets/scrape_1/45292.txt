How much time do I have left to easily spot the recently brightened Recurrent Nova RS Ophiuchi with binoculars and mild light pollution?

Excellent answers to Binocular-friendly star map to find the Recurrent Nova RS Ophiuchi? provide some helpful maps for circa  8Â° FOV binoculars, but due to spatial and potential meteorological challenges I can't get them between me and a clear sky this weekend.
How long do I have to see the Recurrent Nova RS Ophiuchi before it fades substantially?
If I miss it this time, how long do I have to wait for it to "recur"?
