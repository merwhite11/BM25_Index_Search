In km/h, what actually is the "speed" of Andromeda away from us: cosmologically?

Andromeda is about 2.5 million ly away.
Actually, in this universe, at what "speed" (in km/h) are two objects separating cosmologically - I mean strictly due to the "expansion of the universe" - if they are 2.5 million ly apart?
I do understand that local "ordinary" or "peculiar" motion completely swamps this effect.  If I'm not mistaken, the "local" "ordinary" motion of Andromeda per our galaxy happens to be about 400,000 km/h towards us.
Is the "speed" due to the "expansion of the universe" drastically smaller than this?

I assumed that the expansion of the universe (or "of the spacetime metric") is even everywhere: it's well known that it only affects "the largest structures" but I still assumed that the expansion is the same in my room, my galaxy, my cosmological region.  Perhaps this assumption is totally wrong?
