Can a tidally locked planet have their own habitable zone?

As we know, if a planet is near a star and is tidally locked, then at near side it is very hot and at far side it is very cold. But between 2 sides there should be a gradient of temperature change and should have an area which the temperature is suitable for lives. Can we also say it has a habitable zone?
