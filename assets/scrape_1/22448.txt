Why are rocky and small planets nearer to the Sun whereas big, gas giants are farther?

Planets, including Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are rocky planets and are small compared to gas giants. And all these planet are near to Sun. But mass is directly proportional to force. So why don't any planets lie between rocky planets. And if gas giants lie farther always they why does Pluto lie after all the gas giants?
