How do we know the universe's expansion is speeding up?

Please forgive my ignorance, I am not an astronomer, just an interested layman.
The further away a galaxy is from us, the faster it is moving away from us.  But the galaxies we see exist in the distant past because it takes a long time for their light to reach us. The closer galaxies are, the more recent their light is, and the slower they move away from us. Doesnâ€™t this seem to indicate that the expansion of the universe is slowing down, because the more recent light from galaxies, appears to be moving away slower? Does this make sense?
Quote from Wikipedia:

Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.
