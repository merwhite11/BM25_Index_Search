How can neutron stars have gaseous atmospheres?

Neutron stars can have small atmospheres. However, they also have extremely strong gravitationally pulls. Shouldn't the all the gas molecules be drawn to the star's surface, and become solids under the immense pressure?
Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way, but I don't see how it could be possible.
