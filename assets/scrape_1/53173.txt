Do the inner-Earth planets actually align with the constellations we see?

For example, because the Sun is the center of the solar system; when we think that the Sun is on the constellation of Aries, in actuality, isn't Earth  lining up with the constellation opposite Aries: Libra (while the sun stays in the same place)?
Similarly, this would apply to any planet that is closer to the sun than the Earth is: when we see that Mercury is lining up with the constellation Gemini, wouldn't it be lining up with a different constellation in actuality, aka from the perspective of the Sun?
However, there would be no such problem with planets past Earth, because we're looking outward to observe those planets.
