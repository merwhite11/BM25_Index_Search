Could a Martian observer witness the Moon's formation with naked eye?

Suppose a human observer was standing on Mars during the early Solar System, looking up into the night sky, in the approximate direction of the young Earth, as the Theia planet hypothesized in the Giant Impact Formation Theory of our Moon struck the Earth.
Would it have been bright enough to see with the naked eye?
If so, what kind of details would the observe see with naked eye?
