Is there a collection or list of all planned observations of 99942 Apophis during its 2021 close pass to Earth?

For example, I found Goldstone Radar Observations Planning: 99942 Apophis in 2021 and 99942 Apophis 2021; Planned, Scheduled and Completed Observations at lawn.com? which seems empty.
But I'll bet the observation campaign for this important event by various means (radar, optical, infrared...) was well coordinated. Because of the potential long-term risk of impact with Earth it's necessary to learn as much as possible about 99942 Apophis.
