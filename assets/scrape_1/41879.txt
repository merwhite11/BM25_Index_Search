Do low-mass red giants last longer than high-mass red giants?

It turns out that red giant stars are not defined by uniform mass.  Some can be only one-third as massive as our sun, whereas others can be eight times as massive.  So I'm calling the both sides "low-mass" and "high-mass", respectively.
I have been told that red giants last only as long as one billion years, but considering that lower masses equal longer lifespans, I have to ask--is it the high-mass red giants that have the one-G lifespan, or is it the low-mass?
