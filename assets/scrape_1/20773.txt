I want a galaxy count database, also how do I use SDSS skyserver to fetch galaxies?

I'm new to all this and trying to implement galaxy counting. For the initial stage I need raw image data, that is images with galaxies and stars along with a count of how many galaxies there are in the image.
I came across this which seems to have a way to label galaxies 
http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr13/en/tools/chart/navi.aspx?ra=179.68929&dec=-0.45438&opt=
but I cannot figure it out at all, I used this page 
http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr13/en/tools/chart/chartinfo.aspx
to try to get it to label only galaxies are seen but I got nothing (put G in opt section, did not make a difference).
Does anyone know how to operate the above or where I could get images with lots of galaxies (any number would do) in them along with a count of how many galaxies there are in the image?
I found https://data.galaxyzoo.org/ but traversing it seems impossible
