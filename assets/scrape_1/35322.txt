Temperature of a substellar point on an airless tidally-locked planet

If a hypothetical blackbody planet's components were solid at all temperatures, would the substellar point on the airless tidally-locked (1:1) planet eventually heat up to the surface temperature of the star it is orbiting? This material would be a very poor heat conductor.
Also, would the temperature on the opposite point approach the cosmic background temperature 2.7 K?
