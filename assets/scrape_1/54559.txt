ER=EPR and information fuelling cosmic expansion

I apologize in advance for the lack of education, I'm a Canadian hillbilly.
I was considering the concepts of ER=EPR and the growth of the black hole's internal system with the addition of information going into it. I was also considering the concepts of Page time and the outgoing radiation of the black hole.
Question:
Could the expansion of spacetime be the result of 2 entangles systems forming causal boundaries with one another? That when theres a distance great enough that a causal boundary is achieved, the entanglement just transitions its information out in the form of expanding space time? There should be observable tests that one could do to check it, I would think, but then again I huffed gas as a child.
So, again, I apologize for the strange and uneducated comment, but I'm curios in the relation to spacetime and the entanglement of outgoing black hole radiation after the page time, if there is indeed a relation. I feel like they are related -- and I understand I'm breaking all the standards of scientific rigour, but I can't stress enough how mentally diminished I am.
Anyway, any input on this beside the obvious fact that I'm doing nothing but speculating?
Thank you!
