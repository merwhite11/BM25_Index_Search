How can a brown dwarf be more massive than a star?

SDSS J0104+1535 is about 90 times more massive than Jupiter, making it the heaviest known brown dwarf. EBLM J0555-57Ab has a mass of about 85.2Â±4 Jupiter masses, or 0.081 Solar masses.
I am confused. How is a brown dwarf more massive than a red dwarf? Why hasn't it ignited? Does lower metallicity has something to do with this?
