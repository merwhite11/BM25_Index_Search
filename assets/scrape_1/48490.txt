Great Attractor's gravity vs Universe Expansion

I would like to know if the trajectory of our galaxy has been calculated because it is usually said that the cosmos is emptying due to the expansion of the universe but at the same time there is a region of space that we are traveling to along with many other galaxies in the Laniakea supercluster.
Space is expanding in all directions and getting faster and faster but due to the proximity to the Great Attractor, will the Milky Way end up joining together in a sea of galaxies or will it be left alone with Andromeda and satellite galaxies?
