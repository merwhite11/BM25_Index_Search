Do NEA (Near Earth Asteroids) have minable water ice?

Water is very useful for rocket fuel and life support in space. But does water, in abundance and form which conceivably could be usefully mined this century, really exist in NEA's? Or do we have to go all the way out to the frost line, the Asteroid Belt, to find asteroids with available water? (Lunar polar water ice is not topic here, I think, but low delta-v asteroidal water).
