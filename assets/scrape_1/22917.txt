Do the heliospheres of stars at the center of globular clusters interact?

I read that the stars in the center of globular clusters are incredibly close to one another and that these stars can be spaced 100 to 1000 times closer than the stars near the sun. Because these stars are so closely spaced, would their heliospheres interact with each other? There are binary stars whose coronas interact and create powerful x-rays. Would something like that happen with those central globular cluster stars, but on a much larger scale, what with the larger amount of stars involved?
