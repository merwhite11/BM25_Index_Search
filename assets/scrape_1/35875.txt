How do focal length, angular magnification and field of view relate?

The larger the focal length the larger the angular magnification The smaller the focal length the larger the field of view.
I don't understand why this applies. I'm talking specifically about telescopes.
Wouldn't a greater angular magnification imply a greater field of view too?
