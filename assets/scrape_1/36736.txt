What were the nine planets in 1899?

I'm currently reading Planetary Geology, in which they state

When Ceres [...] was discovered in 1899, it was considered as the lost tenth planet.

Uranus and Neptune had been discovered, but Pluto wasn't know yet at the time. What were the nine planets back then? The bodies we now call planets + the Moon?
