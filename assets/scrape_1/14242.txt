Is there a map of the galaxies?

I see that there are many maps of a single galaxy, the Milky Way, showing the positions of the stars within our galaxy.
I could not find a map of Galaxies, however. Is there such a map? In lieu of that I suppose I could make my own map if I knew celestial coordinates of all the nearby galaxies and the distances to those galaxies. Is there such a data table readily available?
