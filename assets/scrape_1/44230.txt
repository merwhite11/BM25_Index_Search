How much of M87 can i see with an amateur telescope?

I was reading about M87 and how it is possible to see it's relativistic jet with an amateur telescope.
About a year ago i impulse-bought a telescope (model: Celestron CE21049 powerseeker 127EQ).
I'm not an expert and do not really understand how i should calculate if i will be able to see it or not.
I live in northern italy, my zone is really light polluted but i usually can see mars, venus, saturn with it's rings and jupiter with some of it's moons.
I can get to a location where, with naked eye, can see faintly the milky way, so i think that's a good start.
There will also be the problem of where to point the telescope, but i think i can manage.
So, will i be able to see something other than a light dot in the sky?
And in the future, how to go about calculating if an object si visible with my current setup?
