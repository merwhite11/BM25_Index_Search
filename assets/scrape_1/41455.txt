Sample bias' contribution to "Planet 9" hypothesis, why was this not thoroughly addressed before?


Science Claim for giant 'Planet Nine' at Solar System's edge takes a hit
arXiv No Evidence for Orbital Clustering in the Extreme Trans-Neptunian Objects

The brightness of distant solar system objects varies as $1/r^4$ and so for elliptical orbits objects are more likely to be discovered near periapsis.
If discovery telescopes are pointed in a biased direction, resulting discoveries will show a bias in orbital elements due to this pointing bias.
That's a rough summary of the recent paper.
Question: Why was this sample bias not thoroughly addressed before? Was there perhaps insufficient statistics until now for such an analysis, or were there other complicating factors?
