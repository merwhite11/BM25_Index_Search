What magnitude stars are visible during a quarter moon, during nautical twilight?

Assuming I'm looking for stars at least 50Â° from the quarter moon, is there any way to determine what magnitude stars would be visible to the naked eye, in a sky without light pollution, during nautical twilight? (Nautical twilight occurs when the geometric center of the Sun's disk is between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon.)
