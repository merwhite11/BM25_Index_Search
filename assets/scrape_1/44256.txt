What is the difference between the terms collision and merger? How are they used differently in Astronomy?

We often hear of mergers of two stellar objects but we also sometimes talk about these or much smaller objects like planets or asteroids colliding.
What is the actual differences between Astronomy and Cosmology? received several excellent answers for example, but here what I'm looking for is if there can be a fairly easy way to differentiate the concepts of merger from that of collision, or establish the degree of overlap.
I do have an ulterior motive; in meta there is the question Do we need a tag for merging? I struggled to find something suitable for supermassive black hole mergers in galaxy collisions but in meta we discuss how the site works and how to maintain or improve it.
Here I'm asking the actual astronomy terminology question:
