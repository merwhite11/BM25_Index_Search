Tracking the Sun from Sunrise in the East to Sunset in the West

Is there a Correct way to mathematically allocate GPS/location of Azimuth Degrees ?
EG:
In the Southern Hemisphere, if North is 0 degrees, for say Sydney is direct East 90 or -90 degrees ?
Then what is direct West -90 degrees or 270 degrees for southern hemisphere ?
Assuming the degrees go from North=0, and goes Clockwise to 360 degrees?
And is Northern Hemisphere the opposite ?
As I am unsure how these are correctly used for following the Sun position through the sky, in mathematical terms!
