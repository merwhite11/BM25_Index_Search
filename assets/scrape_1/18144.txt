How can we use hypervelocity stars to determine the origins of the Universe?

I was reading this article finding evidence of Universe's origin, which describes that in 1 trillion years we may lose the ability to determine how the universe was created.
The answer seems to be using hypervelocity stars.  These are stars that have been ejected from their galaxy.  Using the expansion of the universe, we can use the velocity of the star to then determine evidence of the Big Bang. But how does this work?  Is there calculations we can do now that agree with our understanding of the universe and its age when working with hypervelocity stars?
I understand finding a hypervelocity star is very hard to do. I guess my thought here is that astronomers have modeled this scenario and found that if we were to find a hypervelocity star, we could then use the scenario above to calculate the age.  I'm assuming the age calculated agrees with current estimates.
