Why 2014-2015-2016 were the years when the number of discovered exoplanets increased the most?

So, if we look into the cumulative number of exoplanets discovered by year, you can appreciate a huge rise in the number of discovered exoplanets in the years 2014 and 2016:

Also, I don't know if it's by coincidence or not, but the number of publications with the word "exomoon" (a satellite of an exoplanet) seems to increase dramatically by 2015:

I might be wrong, but I thought that we would see this rise in the years following 2010, like 2011 or 2012, when the Kepler telescope was beginning this hunt, and in the case of the publications, Kipping (2009a, 2009b) were very important around that time too, so is there any reason of why 2014-2015-2016 seem to be the most important years?
