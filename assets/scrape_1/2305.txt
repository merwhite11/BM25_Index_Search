Hamiltonian of general three body problem

i try to extend my analysis from planar restricted three body problem to the general one. 
Is there anyone that can help me to find out the Hamiltonian for this prolem in cartesian coordinates? 
I need the hamiltonian of 3D case somethink like eq.(1) in this article or in this one paper again eq.1 . Because my symplectic integrator can be used only if I have the fixed cartesian coordinates.
Thanks
