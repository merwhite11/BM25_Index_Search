As the Sun dies, does the Earth's orbit change?

As the Sun nears the end of its life and expands, would the Earths orbit get bigger as it moves out or would it stay in the same orbital plane and not move out?  Therefore in the far off future, we'd have 512 days instead of 365 days?
As the Moon is moving out at a distance of 3.8 cms a year (ref: http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/37-our-solar-system/the-moon/the-moon-and-the-earth/111-is-the-moon-moving-away-from-the-earth-when-was-this-discovered-intermediate), are we moving out or in towards the Sun or is this not possible to work out because there is nothing to measure against?
