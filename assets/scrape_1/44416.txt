Can a small black hole orbit a large star?

I recently read about the discovery of a tiny black hole (with only three times the mass of the sun) nicknamed ‘The unicorn’ about 1500 light years from earth. This got me thinking, can this black hole orbit around a star? For example, let’s take UY Scuti with a mass 7-10 times that of the sun.

Is it theoretically possible for a small black hole like the unicorn to revolve around a giant star like UY Scuti?

Will such a star be stable?

Will the black hole take mass from UY Scuti and form an accretion disk?

What will happen if both of them collides?
