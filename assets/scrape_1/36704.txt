Does a merging massive binary black hole ‘emits’ more than one gravitational wave?

If we want to use gravitational waves (GW) to determine the Hubble constant, we need to find the source in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). However, we need to be lucky to ‘see’ it simultaneously in EMS and GW. This is a problem, but do BBH not ‘emit’ more than one GW? E.g. every time they spiral? Because than we have time to find it in the EMS, no? What makes it so difficult? Thanks in advance!
