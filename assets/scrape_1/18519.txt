Sun's formation as "part of a star-forming-cluster..."?

After reading this interesting answer,
I was wondering, do we in fact know if our Sun in particular was created as part of a star-forming-cluster, or, was it more of a solo creation?
(Or, are all stars created as part of star-forming-clusters, is that the norm and how all stars come to be?)
If yes, indeed are we aware of which stars around us, are our sibling star?  (So, there's a list somewhere "stars known to likely be sibling to our Sun from a certain star-forming-cluster".)  Or have they dispersed over the 4 billion years and it's impossible to know, or is it just the case that "all the stars anywhere nearby" are/were indeed siblings from "our" star-forming-cluster?
Further, I'm having trouble grasping the order of magnitude of star-forming-clusters. Consider say "all the stars in our arm of the galaxy": Consider the question "in how many star-forming-clusters did all those stars originate?"  Is the answer like "3", "a few hundred" or "100 million" ??
Perhaps most simply: if sol formed as part of a star-forming-cluster, what's the order of magnitude of how many stars formed with it?
