Where do we define the "surface" of a gas planet?

Since gas giant consist of most gas components, where do we establish their "surface"?
My take is basically to take the limit in which all light is opaque. For example, in this photo:

The surface, then, will be the limit of the black blackground with the planet.
Any other way to formally define the "surface" of a gas giant?
