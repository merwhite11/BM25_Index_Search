By analytical geometry, how to calculate the fraction of the visible area of the Sun at a point during an eclipse?

Assume a perfectly spherical Sun and Moon, and ignore atmospheric effects for simplicity. I'm an observer in the origin of my coordinate system, and I know the positions of the centers of the Sun and the Moon. I also know their radii.
At some point during an eclipse, my view of the Moon partially overlaps that of the Sun. Without the eclipse occuring, I could see 100% of the Sun in terms of solid angles. But since the view of Moon now partially blocks the Sun, I can see less. How do I calculate how much of the Sun is still visible to me at that time, as a ratio of solid angles, using the position and radii information?
This is not an observation-based question, since if I was actually observing the event, I could simply shoot a few photos and count the number of pixels and save myself the headache. This is more of a pure geometry question in that sense, to which I haven't found a simple and satisfying answer until now - meaning an (or a set of) equation(s) into which I can plug in the positions and the radii and get the result. To me it looks like that much information is just enough to get the answer, I just can't wrap my head around deriving the maths of it.
