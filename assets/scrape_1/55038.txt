According to this A purple moon?
In March 12, 2017 there was a purple moon somewhere , "just risen, color altered red moon". I've seen yellowish, redish moons, but I've never seen a purple moon. Which conditions / situations / place / moment is there a purple moon in the sky in? Can it be predicted where and when it will appear? Does this appear only in some specific part of the world?
