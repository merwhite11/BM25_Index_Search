What positional accuracy (ie, arc seconds) is necessary to view Saturn, Uranus, beyond?

My son and I are building an azimuth/elevation controller to point the telescope at planets using servos and a microcontroller. Assuming that our device is calibrated (that is, we tell our device to point at a specific RA/Dec and points in the right direction):
How accurate must positioning be (in arcseconds?) to point directly at a planet like Uranus and have it show up in the eyepiece? In case it matters, we are using a Celestron 70EQ with our own az/el hardware.)
(Perhaps another way to ask is this: if we have an outer planet in view, how many arc seconds need to pass before the object leaves the telescope's view?)
We are both new to astronomy, so our terminology or understanding could be off a bit, correct me where necessary.
Ultimately the motivation for this question is because we are considering the Astronomy Engine C library which guarantees within Â±1 arcminute and want to know if that is high enough resolution to get the planet in view of the eyepiece.
Thanks!
