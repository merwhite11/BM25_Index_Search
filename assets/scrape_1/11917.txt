Was there ever a Jupiter transit or Saturn transit?

I've watched the Venus transit 2004 with a small telescope, a relatively rare event, considering most people can only observe two in their life time.
If E.T. were sitting in a sunny place on a moon of the outer planets,
sipping on a liquid nitrogen drink, would there ever be (has there ever been) a transit of an inner gas giant?
I guess if E.T. were in Sputnik Planum, there would be no transits due to Pluto's orbital plane being inclined too much wrt. the Ecliptic.
