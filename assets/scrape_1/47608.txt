New to Astrophotography

I just had a quick question on my telescope I recently purchased.
I have a Canon Rebel XTi and I paired that with the William Optics Guide Star 61 Guidescope.
The Specs on the Scope are:

Guide Scope Aperture 61mm
Guide Scope Focal Ratio f/5.9
Guide Scope Focal Length 360mm

I believe a lot of people use this for deep sky photography.
I was having issues trying to focus on planets, do you guys think this would be able to focus tightly on any planets.
Here is the link to what I have.
Thank you so much for you're time, I'm new to this site too!
