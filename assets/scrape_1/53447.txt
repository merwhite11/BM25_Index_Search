Is a bromine planet possible?

Is it possible to have a terrestrial, rocky, earth-sized planet (by earth-sized I mean approximately the same mass and volume as earth) which has vast quantities of bromine on its surface, in the form of bromine liquid and vapour? I’ve never heard of these “bromine worlds” being considered possible as exoplanets; but I have heard of sulphur planets, carbon planets and phosphorous planets being considered possible exoplanet categories, and wondered whether a bromine World is possible as well.
So, could a bromine planet exist? What would it look like? And what conditions would be necessary for such a world to form?
