Is it possible for a star cluster to be composed of main sequence stars?

From what I hear about globular clusters, they are primarily composed of very hot giant stars, which are not the most conducive for life as we know it.
Main sequence stars like our own, due to their relatively long lifespans and generally weaker radiation, are a much better candidate.
So, is it possible for a globular cluster to exist, but one composed primarily of small main-sequence stars such G-type, M-type and K-type dwarfs?
