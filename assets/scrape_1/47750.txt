How is light unable to escape a black hole if photons are massless?

I understand light will follow the curved space that the BH is causing due to its mass. I also understand that mass attracts other mass but then photons are massless.
So 0(photon) x m2 (the BH) is equal to zero.  So how is zero force preventing the photon from escaping.
I am not a science denier, I'm just a layman asking questions because I am clearly missing something.
The layman understanding of gravity is "mass attracts mass" but aren't photons and black holes showing us more than this.
The photon is only following the curvature of space but we could say that everything follows the curvature.  Wouldn't "mass curve spacetime and "EVERYTHING" follows the curve" be more accurate than saying "mass attracts mass." Do we need a second mass, doesn't $\frac{m_1m_2}{r2}$ equal zero when one of the "objects" is massless?
"Mass attracts mass" obviously works but isn't it only half the of what's happening?I'm struggling to even explain the question.
Sorry for the long drawn out question, I needed to make clear my lack of understanding so the answer doesn't cause more confusion.
Thanks for your patience, and all jokes aside, feel free to answer like a 10 year old because I'm confused.
