Are there any predictions of what galaxies exist in the Norma cluster/ Abell 3267?

I am working on a map for a science fiction story and using what information is available I have a good idea of locations of nearby galaxy groups and clusters and where the known supermassive black holes are.
As the Norma cluster is a big area of debate and due to that and other areas being obscured by our own galaxies, observing what is in those areas is difficult. Going off Wikipedia this cluster has a binding mass of 1E15 solar masses, which is the same as the Virgo cluster and only one galaxy is mentioned which is ESO 137-001.
Is this mass based of our galaxies motion in that direction so mass behind the cluster (some believe the Shapley supercluster) is giving the value we have or is that a known mass of galaxies in that cluster? If so can we predict if it has a similar number of large galaxies and supermassive black holes as the Virgo cluster or is there other predictions for the Norma cluster?
