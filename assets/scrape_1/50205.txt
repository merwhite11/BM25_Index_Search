Do pop III stars undergo supernova or direct collapse?

Population III stars were the first stars to form. They are hypothesised as being very massive, i.e., > 100 M$_{\odot}$. My question regards how do these stars end their lives?
An old orthodoxy for high mass stars, i.e. those with mass between ~40 and 100 M$_{\odot}$, is that they will form into black holes via direct collapse without producing supernovae (and possibly without receiving natal kicks). This is, however, uncertain and there are papers that explore the possibility of these high mass stars undergoing supernovae (and receiving natal kicks in formation... there are many types of natal kicks possible, and they may be neutrino driven or hydrodynamical driven, its complicated).
On the other hand, I've seen many papers about the (possible) supernovae of pop III stars, e.g.'s, this, this and this. Naively, I would have suspected that the very massive pop III stars would undergo direct collapse to form black holes.
Questions: Under what conditions may a pop III star undergo a supernova, i.e., only certain masses, composition, etc? Does (the core of) a pop III star that undergoes a supernova form a proto-neutron star before forming a black hole? For the second question, I would suspect not, since there would be so much mass around, but maybe this depends on the metallicity?
EDIT:
A related question: maybe I'm just really confused, but how can there be a supernova if the star undergoes direct formation of a black hole? Naively, I'd expect there to be no supernova in a direct collapse process, since there would be no ejected material? Maybe I'm missing something here? For example, on the second page of this paper, they state "These stars die as extremely energetic thermonuclear supernovae..... Such events would be the most energetic explosions in the cosmos, and their detection could reveal the birthplaces of SMBHs created by direct collapse..."
