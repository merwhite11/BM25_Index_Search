How bright would Sagittarius A* be from Earth if it became an Active Galactic Nucleus?

Essentially I'd like to know how bright our central black hole could appear from earth in relation to full moon brightness. Assuming maximum energy output (like when it's gobbling up an entire globular cluster). I've read that the light from an AGN could actually support photosynthesis on planets within 1100 light years, so I'm curious if it would have any affect on Earth life 25000 light years away.
