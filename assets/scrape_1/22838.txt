Can we actually predict an asteroid impact?

I have been seeing all these "hoaxes" on the internet about Planet X and how it would destroy Earth, on September 23rd 2017. It didn't happen.
I started to wonder if it's possible - with our current technology - to map the path of an asteroid with calculations of how an asteroid will pass near or collide with Earth. I've heard one is going to "safely" pass Earth on January 13th 2019.
