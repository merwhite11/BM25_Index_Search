What's special about Saturn that it has distinctive rings?

This may overlap with other questions, but I'm asking what is unique about Saturn in location, properties, etc that is has far more pronounced rings?   It's between Jupiter and Uranus and Neptune in size and position.  So what's special?  Is there some Goldilocks zone of rings formation?   Or is it just an accident of history?
