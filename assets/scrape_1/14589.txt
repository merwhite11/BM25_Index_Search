Jupiter appearing odd through a 6" reflector

Recently I have been trying to get a good look at Jupiter through my 6" Orion reflector, but the image seems to always come out as an oblong white streak. I've tried changing the lenses I'm using, but that only changes the size of the oblong streak. I looked at the moon with the same lenses to see if it was a general problem with the reflector, but the image of the moon came out clear as usual. What sort of problems could be causing this?
