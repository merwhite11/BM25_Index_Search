How to design a static heliostat?

An heliostat is a device capable of reflecting the sun in a fixed point while the sun itself moves into the sky, thanks to a moving mirror.
But this company astonished me with its invention: a static heliostat! Rather than mounting a mirror on a pan&tilt mechanism, they designed a curved mirror which, at any time in the day, reflects sun in a same point (actually same strip).

How can I design a static mirror which reflects a sun-strip over a wall all along a day? Let's suppose I have these data:

Wall exposed to North.
Mirror 5 meters away.
Apprximate location: 42N, 12E.

I am trying experimenting with Geogebra and OptGeo but with no luck so far.
I can reorient the mirror by hand every week or month, but I don't want to have to reorient it hour by hour!
