JWST Early Black Holes: Gas Collapsed To Metallic Hydrogen Core?

I was reading an article about early black holes found by JWST at Redshift 9. And saw that there was wonder at how large amounts of gas could collapse into a black hole as a theory.
So my question is this: could the gas pressure have created a Metallic Hydrogen or otherwise dense core due to intense pressure which lead to a black hole collapse?
In the current age of the universe, the gas giants made of hydrogen could have Metallic Hydrogen near the core, so could we use this as a model for how compact early universe gas could've behaved, albeit under more intense early universe conditions?
If the core formed from the gas was rotating (as fast as a pulsar for example) in the early universe and was rotating too fast to maintain a stable state to start fusion yet maintained it's core, then could it go straight to a collapse with an abundance of material around it?
