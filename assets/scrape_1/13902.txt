How often do meteorites hit the Earth?

I heard of one that occurred in 2008 in the Nubian Desert in Sudan, how often does it happen? Is there a catalogue of all hits or are they very rare?

At the time of asking I had not thought about the distinction between hitting the atmosphere and hitting the Earth.
