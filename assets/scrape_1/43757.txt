Planetary tails: How many have we observed yet?

Just recently I learned that Mercury has a sodium tail and it is actually well studied since long:

As a result, the planet has the appearance of a comet, with a tail that's been observed streaming nearly 3.5 million kilometres away from the planet.

This made me wonder about exoplanets with tails, like WASP-69b. How many (exo)planets are known to have a tail?

Why would a planet form a cometlike tail under conditions of weaker rather than stronger solar wind?
