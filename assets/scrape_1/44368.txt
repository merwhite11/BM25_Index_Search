Best Books on Spherical Astronomy

I am preparing for an astronomy olympiad and a good amount of questions in the olympiad come from Spherical astronomy, some of the books ive tried reading were too hard to understand as this topic requires a good amount of visual representation. Does anyone have any good courses or books on this topic for beginners which like deals with spherical trignometry then goes on to the celestial sphere, I would be greatly appreciate it if anyone can help me.
