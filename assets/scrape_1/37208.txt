Ideas for a project in astronomy and deep learning

I am currently pursuing computer engineering and am in my senior year. I'm looking for a long term project (ideally 2-4 months) in astronomy and deep learning. I have extensively worked on the Galaxy Zoo project and am pretty content with the results. I'm looking for similar projects with easily available datasets. Can someone suggest me some ideas?
