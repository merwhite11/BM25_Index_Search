How is the distance from Earth to distant celestial bodies calculated?

It's difficult for most people to grasp how distances between the Earth and distant celestial bodies are calculated. For example, when someone tells me that a given star is 100 light years away, how would I determine if that were accurate?
I think that my question boils down to three general use cases:

How can I calculate the distance between Earth and a local body in our solar system such as the sun, Jupiter, our moon, or Neptune?
How can I calculate the distance between Earth and the nearest star outside of our own solar system, Alpha Centauri?
How can I calculate the distance between Earth and an extremely distant object, such as a star 100-1,000 light-years away?

I've heard of using red shift to calculate large distances, but what exactly is this and how does it work?
