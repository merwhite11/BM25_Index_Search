Any record of the Earth passing through the tail (not trail) of a comet?

Discussion below the Space SE question How hard is it to fly through the tail of a comet? Has it been done? has led me to ask if there is any record of the Earth passing through the tail of a comet.
That's tail not trail. The annual meteor showers we talk about, even the unicorns are the Earth passing through the trail of breadcrumbs distributed long ago. This question is about the tail(s) of comets, those things we see in photos and sometimes by eye.
