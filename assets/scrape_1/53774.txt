How do we know the expansion of the universe is not centered around our position?

It is my understanding that the red shift of galaxies in whatever direction we look shows the universe is expanding in every direction around us. That could be explained in two ways:
A (accepted): The universe is expanding in every point, like the stretched surface of a balloon, and therefore it's expansion looks the same whatever is your position as an observer.
B (unlikely): Earth is somehow at the center of the universe, who is expanding from this point.
I am not contesting A, but I am curious about how B was discarded although we only ever have been able to observe the universe from Earth or it's vicinity for a (astronomicaly speaking) brief period of time (and therefore a relatively small portion of space even though our solar system and galaxy, etc are also moving). Is there some positive reason to think we are not at the center of the universe, or is it more of a "it would be very unlikely that we just happen to be at the center of the expansion" type of reasoning?
