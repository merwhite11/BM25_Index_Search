Why don't we have in-between planets?

The planets in our system are most often grouped into two categories:  
Terrestrial:

Mercury
Venus
Earth
Mars

Gas Giants:

Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus
Neptune

Why is it that we don't see "in-between" planets in our system - large, rocky worlds larger than Earth but with thick atmospheres somewhat similar to those of gas giants? Are they possible? Did they not occur by random chance?
