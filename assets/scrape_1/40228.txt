The activity of the galactic nucleus is cyclic?

Are there observations/theoretical calculations that prove or disprove a cyclic activity of the galactic nucleus (I mean the nucleus is active than stops than become newly active with a time comparable to the galaxy rotation)?
I remember a lecture given by an astronomer two or three years ago in Arcetri that was speaking of a period of activity and inactivity of the Galaxy Nucleus. The speaker was referring to this phenomena as something that was emerging from observations, so this might very be a well known answered question but I couldn't find anywhere.
