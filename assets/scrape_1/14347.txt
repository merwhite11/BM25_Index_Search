Are there events in universe which we receive first from their neutrino's instead of their photons?

Neutrino's are very small though they have mass. Because of that it is probably that the don't have a speed faster than photons.
But is it in all events, like supernova's or else events, where it is possible that we first receive their neutrino's instead of their light? 
Perhaps gravity or other interactions could change something in their way to earth?
