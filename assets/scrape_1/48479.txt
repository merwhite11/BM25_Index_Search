How much of the earth would remain intact if the sun expanded into a red giant encompassing its orbit?

It seems to me that part of the earth might survive being absorbed by a red giant. How long would it take the heat, plasma, magnetic field, etc. of the sun to eat away at the earth? How long could it orbit while inside the outer edge of the sun? Do we have any idea what would happen to the earth and how long it would take?
Would it be a year in orbit? 100 years? A million?
