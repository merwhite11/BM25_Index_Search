Does the Sun shift periodically between prograde and retrograde rotation about its axis?

Prograde means rotating in the same direction in which most of the planets in our solar system rotate, which is counterclockwise, and retrograde rotation means the opposite, i.e., clockwise rotation.
I do not remember the source, but somewhere I had read that Sun continues shifting between prograde and retrograde rotation. The rotation will be prograde for a particular period of the interval; after that, it will be retrograde and then again prograde. I do not remember exactly where I had read this. But now, when I search on google if this is true, I am not getting any relevant information. Now I doubt whether this is indeed true or not. Can someone help me with this?
Note: I am talking about retrograde rotation, not retrograde orbit.
