Is there a Lagrange point between the earth and the moon?

Is there a Lagrange point between the earth and moon where a space station could sit forever without orbiting around either? Just curious, but it seems like a place like that would be perfect for either a second space station or maybe like a giant tv that could display international weather or something. Or maybe a giant laser that can shoot down all that space debris.
