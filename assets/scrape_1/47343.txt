The Kuiper Belt and Oort cloud

How come the comets and asteroids in the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud are kept in a gravitational field and they don't get pushed and pulled by the planets around them? I get why comets in the Oort cloud couldn't have developed to be planets cause of the cold and distance from the sun, but wouldn't really big comets in the same orbit of Jupiter have at least got some planet-like properties? Like an atmosphere, or whatever? What makes a (small) comet not developed enough to have this? They are failed planets, they started off hot as well.
And how come the comets/asteroids around Jupiter have the exact same orbital period around the sun? Isn't the orbital period determined on e.g. the mass of the object and the distance to the object it's orbiting around? I don't get how a comet, which is probably a million times lighter than Jupiter, can have the same orbital period and speed around the sun.
