What are these dark artifacts in this New Horizons image?


Are these photographic artifacts of some kind and if so how would they occur?
They are almost the same exact shape and size.
It is a photo of the Kuiper Belt from the New Horizon space probe taken directly from NASA web site.
If it is not a common photographic event then what could it be?
