What precisely leads to planets like COCONUTS-2b to orbit so far away from their host stars, 6000 AU in its case?

Taking our Solar System as an example, most gas giants formed relatively close by (a few AU) and drifted away to reasons I don't know, from an explanation I recall reading. Simply orbiting a few AU away leaves Jupiter very cold. From what I've read, simply observing the bodies orbiting the Sun a few 40 or so AU away reveals they are very sparse in number, and small dwarf planets at best.
This too, is for a fairly large sun like ours, which I assume would have had a much larger protoplanetary disc compared to your average red dwarf star, which COCONUTS-2a is.
How would a planet, that too a gas giant of all things, find itself orbiting a very small star which would have a weaker gravitational pull compared to a Sun-like star like ours at a ludicrous distance of 6000 AU?
Would the gravitational pull not be very weak there for a star like COCONUTS-2a? Not to mention, how would a planet like 2b make it there? Drifting a few AU away is understandable and probable, but assuming it formed an AU at best from 2a, how would it end up at 6000 AU?
