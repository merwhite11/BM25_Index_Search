How big is the energy content of the magnetic field of the Milky Way?

Galaxies have associated magnetic fields. So does the Sun and so does the Earth. In the case of the Earth and Sun it seems clear that the energy content of the magnetic fields is much less than their mass.
Can the same be said of the Milky Way or other galaxies?
