Are planets far from their parent star more likely or less likely to have an atmosphere?

Are non-gaseous planets (e.g. super-Earths) that are either rogue or very far from their parent star(s) less likely or more likely to have a significant atmosphere?
On one hand planets closer to their sun are more likely to be stripped of their atmosphere by solar winds et cetera, hence any planets that are too close to the sun won't have atmospheres, e.g. Mercury.
On the other hand planets too far from their sun will have their atmosphere collapse to the ground, as is the case with Eris and to some degree Pluto when they approach aphelion.
Is a very far distance from the Sun then favorable for a terrestrial planet to have an atmosphere or rather not? Is there something like an "atmosphere zone" around stars, a distance in which it's neither too hot for the atmosphere to get lost nor too cold for an atmosphere to collapse?
