What is the best database for identification of spectral lines?

What is the best database for the identification of spectral lines? For instance, I have a red spectrum of A0 star and I would like to recognize the most prominent lines, where to find them? Many thanks.
EDIT:
Why is O2 line not in NIST? It would be about 2676.99 A.

After advice:
How to install the database for molecules https://bitbucket.org/OES_muni/massiveoes/src/master/? I obtained the following error:
python setup.py develop
/home/linux/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools/dist.py:474: UserWarning: Normalizing '1.001' to '1.1'

error: can't create or remove files in install directory

The following error occurred while trying to add or remove files in the
installation directory:

    [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/test-easy-install-547.write-test'

The installation directory you specified (via --install-dir, --prefix, or
the distutils default setting) was:

    /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  If the
installation directory is a system-owned directory, you may need to sign in
as the administrator or "root" account.  If you do not have administrative
access to this machine, you may wish to choose a different installation
directory, preferably one that is listed in your PYTHONPATH environment
variable.

For information on other options, you may wish to consult the
documentation at:

Please make the appropriate changes for your system and try again.
