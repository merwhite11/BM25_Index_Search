Gravitational wave for Solo mass system

every equation i found in internet for gravitational wave radiation is for binary system which is need 2 mass in order to find strain (h).
my question is:
if we have one mass which is oscillate , how about this one for calculating strain(h) ?
for example: for a single mass 1.000.000 kg & frequency 100 times per second
if there is formula or reference link , let us know.
