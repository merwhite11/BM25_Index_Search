Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar - what is the rate of mass/energy loss from the source?

Following on from an earlier question about the very interesting Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar.  The high-frequency (radio) beam from the spinning pulsar sweeps across Earth about 17 times per second.  The total power of the gravitational radiation (waves) emitted by the binary system is calculated from GTR to be $7.35 Ã— 10^{24}$ watts at present (declining as the orbital period and radius diminish).
Weisberg & Taylor, 2004 report that the beam has "a flux density of about 1 mJy at 1400 MHz."  (mJy = milliJansky, thanks Stan Liou). Assuming that this flux is uniform across a conical beam with cross-sectional radius 5 arc degrees  and assuming that the source is 21,000 light years from Earth and has mass = 1.44 Solar Masses:-  How much energy is emitted (per second) from the source in the beam? Also (if it is possible to estimate a reasonable range of values) what might be the rate of steady mass loss from such a source?
