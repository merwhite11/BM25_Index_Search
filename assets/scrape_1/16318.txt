Could the Sun's magnetosphere block extraterrestrial contact?

I was reading how certain strong magnetic fields can block or alter radio waves so bearing this in mind would it be possible for the Sun's magnetosphere to block attempts to establish radio contact from other solar systems if the signal is weak enough?
