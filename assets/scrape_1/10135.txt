Why are the high density regions in outer space black holes?

The escape velocity of an object is given by the following formula.
$$v_e=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}=\sqrt{\frac{2 \mu}{r}}= \sqrt{2gr}$$
As far as I am aware, the mass of the star which formed the black hole is the same as the black hole itself, the only difference is the black hole's density. 
Now, the escape velocity of the star which formed the black hole is not as high because light can escape the star. Considering the equation above, $G$ is constant, $M$ is constant, however, $r$ changes resulting in a much smaller region as compared to the star. Consequently, it's the radius which determines the high escape velocity of a black hole, not its density. Then why is it that I always hear that black holes behave the way they do because they are highly dense regions in spacetime? What am I getting wrong? Thanks.
