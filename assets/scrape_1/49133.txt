Why do some supermassive black holes have a * in their name?

Sgr A*, M87*,... Several supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies have a star (*) in their name. But many others do not. Is there a physical difference between the SMBHs that are denoted by a star and those that are not?
