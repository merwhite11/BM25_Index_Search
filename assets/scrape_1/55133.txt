Why is it so difficult to believe that the Sun once had a companion star

If the Sun once had an older companion star that exploded 5 billion years ago it could surely explain many things about the solar system. Such as why so many planets have hot cores that are cooling. Also why the planets formed at the same time.
Ok perhaps explode is wrong. What if the companion star became a Red giant and then shed its outer layer. What was left could have ended up as a white dwarf or even a brown dwarf. If the distance between the stars was great enough it could have wandered off. If instead it was again captured by the remaining star it could now be either Neptune or Uranus.
