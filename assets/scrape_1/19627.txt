Can a planet with a hydrogen atmosphere have a water ocean with dissolved oxygen?

Reading up on rogue planets (i. e. planets not orbiting a star), it turns out that a rogue Super-Earth with a sufficiently dense hydrogen atmosphere could retain its internal heat and have oceans/lakes of liquid water. What I'd like to know is whether those oceans could contain dissolved oxygen in equilibrium. Please advise if this should be best posted to Chemistry...
