What is "emission measure"?

Many papers mention emission measure, and some of them give the expression of EM, BUT there is no clear definition of EM.
My question is what EM is on earth? Its unit is supposed to be cm-3.
How to calculate EM? here(4B5) gives an expression, but it can not be derived from a light curve directly.
Given an X-ray light curve(not from the Sun), probably I need to devide the light curve into many bins and do spectral fitting.
Then what should I do? Rererence papers with clear definition and expression are welcome.
