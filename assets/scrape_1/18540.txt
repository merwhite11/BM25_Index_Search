Dfferent distances to comet 67P

Earlier, I was looking for the current distance from Earth to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in order to do a "back of envelope" calculation of signal delay. Not important, but I was somewhat puzzled to find quite a large discrepancy between values reported by different sites, and would love to understand why.
ESA's Where is Rosetta page currently gives the distance as around 719m km, which, if I'm using it correctly, is backed up by JPL Horizons tool, which gives me a delta of around 4.81 AU. Which is great.
But when I look at The Sky Live's 67P live tracker, it is reporting around 941m km, which their comet info page gives as around 6.3 AU. Am I missing something blindingly obvious?
