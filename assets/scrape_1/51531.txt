Python Program for Synodic months

I am trying to make an astronomical program for celestial bodies in our solar system (and beyond!).
However I want it to show how many Synodic months since New moon. Example: Since last 2022 there happened 0.50794789457 Synodic months.
So is there any API/library to get such data (it's not a necessity that a module would be required)? .
