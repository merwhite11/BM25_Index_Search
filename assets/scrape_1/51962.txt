Interpreting the color of galaxies in deep field images

The HST produced some deep field images in mostly visible light, which contain thousands of galaxies that range in color from white to red (e.g. see here). I understand that the interpretation of astrophotographic images is confused by image processing and colorization of IR and other light. But for deep field images of galaxies in the visible range, can I interpret the "red looking" galaxies as being red due to redshift? I would have assumed this to be the case if it were not for the fact that the redder galaxies do not seem obviously correlated with smaller angular diameter (i.e. they do not look farther away). Are galaxies naturally so diverse in color that it is a mistake to interpret redder galaxies as being redshifted?
