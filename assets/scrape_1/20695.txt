How big is one arcsecond at various distances?

I've been reading this article
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_coordinate_system
and a question came to my mind.
The minimum units are seconds ( â€³ ). I picture an angle of 1 second as being like a "cone" going out from Earth. It's really small at the beginning but as you go further its width increases.
How wide does this cone get as you get further into the universe? How big is an arcsecond on different astronomical bodies?
