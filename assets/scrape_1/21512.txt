How do we know that Singularity is not an object with reasonable radius?

So for example: a Neutron star has a radius of 10km and 2 solar masses. 
A singularity can have a radius of 1m and 10 solar masses, with a 1km event horizon radius. Basically it will just be a more compact object than a neutron star. How come we are so sure that singularity is an infinitely small point instead?
