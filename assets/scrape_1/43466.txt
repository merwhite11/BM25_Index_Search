Hypothetically, could a civilization in a solar system near a supermassive blackhole use the blackhole as a huge gravity lens telescope?

I have heard of various proposals that use the massive gravity of stars to sort of focus light at and observe with a suitable telescope placed at such a distance, and I am assuming here that bigger the star in terms of mass, the more focusing and the better images the telescope sees
Assuming a hypothetical civilization, or perhaps humanity developed such a telescope, could they bring it feasibly close enough to a supermassive black hole at the center of say, our galaxy to observe insanely far away celestial bodies and bodies close by with incredible detail?
Typically, uptil what distance could we comfortably resolve details of say, the color and clouds of exoplanets, and view stars with this? A few hundred thousand light years atleast?
