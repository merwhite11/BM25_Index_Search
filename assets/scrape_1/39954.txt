Is a trefoil orbit around a trinary star valid?

Recently, I have been experimenting with weirdly-shaped orbits with a program called "My Solar System 2.04." While looking for interesting orbits of a spacecraft in a trinary star, I found an type of quasi-orbit called of a trefoil, as shown in this clip. Is this orbit possible in real life, and are there any examples of them that we know of?
