How do we know that spacetime is fabric?

I have started learning about astronomy as it amazes and inspires me.
I have a question. What led us to believe that spacetime is fabric? What is the evidence shows this, and is it considered proven?
If possible Send me the link for research papers so I can learn more.
Please explain in layman's term as I am not a astronomy student but a biology student.
Also let me know books that I can be read.
