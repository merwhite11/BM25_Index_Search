Is there an equivalent of the red shift effect for cosmic rays?

I had read somewhere that light from very distant sources can be measured to be increasingly red shifted the further away the object is (due to cosmic inflation?).
Suppose you had an object emitting cosmic rays or neutrinos other physical matter (not photons), is there an equivalent effect for these objects? ex: a red-shifted helium nuceli in a cosmic ray or red-shifted neutrinos coming from a neutrino source?
