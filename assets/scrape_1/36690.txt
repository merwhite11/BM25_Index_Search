How can I improve the Field of View of my home-made telescope?

I made my telescope, with two convex lens of focal length 1000mm and eyepiece (plano-convex) with 25mm focal length. But I can see only a very small field of view, with inverted image. Do I need to increase the diameter lenses for more area capture, and can I use concave as eyepiece for upright image?
Or does some different solution exit?
I can read all information related to telescopes and binoculars, ie. how lenses work, which lenses combination are for which purposes (terrestrial and astronomical), and increase or decrease area and magnification.
Please note here I am talking about only refracting telescope, and binoculars.
