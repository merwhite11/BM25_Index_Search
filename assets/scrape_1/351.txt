Why has Moving Cluster Method been successful only for Hyades?

At all places where I have read of Moving Cluster Method for measuring distance to a cluster and once applied myself on data, I have been told that the method has been successfully applied only to Hyades cluster in Taurus.

Question : What factor made the method unsuccessful for other known clusters?
