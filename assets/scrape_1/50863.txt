Why are most cosmic rays positively charged? Has anyone figured this out yet?

It is by now very common knowledge that the vast majority of (known) cosmic rays are protons, alpha particles and such, yet I cannot find in my recent reading any discussion of why this might be, or what may have happened to the electrons, etc...
You would think, naively, that the lighter electrons would be easier to accelerate to such incredible speeds, but..
Are lighter-weight electrons more easily deflected by our magnetosphere?  Are they captured in our Van Allen belts?
Is there ongoing research/experiments in this area?
P.S.:  Yes, as stated on SE physics, lighter-weight electrons are more readily deflected, but.... Aren't they moving at higher speeds to begin with?  Wouldn't this counteract that?  Sort of like how objects of different masses fall at the same speed, due to the equivalence principle....
