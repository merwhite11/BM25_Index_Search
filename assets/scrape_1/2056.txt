Does the holographic principle contradict eternal inflation?

As it is for example explained here, Andrei Linde's chaotic inflation is among the potential winners or survivors of the spring cleaning induced by the potential detection of primoridal gravitational waves. As this type of inflation is eternal, the new data might also lend some updraft to the multiverse business etc ...
But I always thought that because of the holographic principle, which means when applied to the exponentially expanding universe that stuff moving away can be thought of as being attracted to the cosmic horizon which takes to role of a black hole horizon, it does not make sense to talk about regions or any other universes beyond the cosmic horizon anyway.
So, does the holographic principle contradict eternal inflation as it arises for example from Linde's chaotic inflation? What does the detaction of primordial gravitational waves then mean when taking the holographic principle into account?
