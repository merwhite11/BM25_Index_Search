Where is a Hollow Object's Center of Gravity?

Let's imagine that the Earth's moon is hollow and the remaining mass is structurally strong enough to retain its spherical shape (like a really big tennis ball).
Given this scenario, where would its center of gravity be? What would the conditions be like inside? Also would one still be able to stand on the moon?
