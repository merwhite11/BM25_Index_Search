What happened to NS spectral types after OBAFGKM?

What happened to NS after OBAFGKM? The full mnemonic was "O Be a Fine Girl Kiss Me Now Sweetheart" a few decades ago as I remember. I think it was that way in "The Larousse Encyclopaedia of Astronomy" which I once had. The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy (which I still have, first published in 1977, Reprinted 1979) has "OBAFGKMRNS", this seems to stem from work done by Annie J. Cannon resulting in the classification of over 225,000 stars in catalogues published between 1918 and 1924, suggesting that "OBAFGKMRNS" is the accepted list "now" (1977?). So what happened to the "R" also? Of course you can't quote these mnemonics now, because of "Political Correctness", though you can always explain that G could be either Guy or Girl!
