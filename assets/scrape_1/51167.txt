Do all the accretion disks around a compact object (black hole or neutron star) emit astrophysical jet outflow?

Do all the accretion disks around a compact object (black hole or neutron star) emit astrophysical jet outflow? I mean is it mandatory for a jet to be emitted from an accretion disk?

If so, then why?
If not, then what is/are the condition(s) for emitting a jet? Are there some examples of systems that clearly don't?
