What does "spun out" mean?

In A Very Short Introduction: Black Holes by Katherine Blundell, the author noted that "Black holes are very messy eaters", and explained that saying:

It transpires that only a fraction (estimated to be 10%, though it can be very significantly higher) of the matter that gets attracted in towards a black hole gets as far as the event horizon and actually gets swallowed. Chapter 8 considers what happens to the matter infalling towards a black hole that doesn’t actually get swallowed within the event horizon. From across the accretion disc itself, matter can blow off as a wind; from within the innermost radii of the accretion disc very rapid jets of plasma squirt out at speeds that are really quite close to the speed of light. As Chapter 8 shows, what doesn’t get eaten by the black hole gets spun out and spat out rather spectacularly.

What's exactly meant by "spun out" in this context? Does it mean "be released away through a spiral path", since the plasma jets shown in chapter 8 take a zigzag/corkscrew pattern?
