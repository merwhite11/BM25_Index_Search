Radio Astronomy and Imaging

So, I've been starting to investigate radio astronomy, and am wondering about if certain things are possible from an amateur standpoint. I was looking at this powerpoint(that discusses building a tiny radio telescope), http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/download-redirect.cfm?Doc_ID=347&Doc_Filename=IBTcom1%2Eppt .
On Slides 11, 12, and 13, it shows various radio emissions overlayed on the orion constellation. As well as Slide 17 and 18.
I'm wondering, is the data acquired in these images, doable from an amateur standpoint? From previous research I think I can build some detection devices for the Hydrogen Line emission(1420Mhz/21cm line), and that could lead to data(per my initial/basic understanding)  that's shown in image 1. Am I right in that assumption, and are the other emissions or data doable from an amateur standpoint?
