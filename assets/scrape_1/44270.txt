Is it suspicious that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light?

Thinking about gravitational waves and the fact that they propagate at the speed of light, I was wondering if it isn't suspicious - the speed of light I mean. Does it perhaps point to something fundamental about the spacetime? Is there maybe some connection between EMR and spacetime itself? Or am I seeing things in the tea leaves?
