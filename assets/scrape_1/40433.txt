Does anything orbit the Sun faster than Mercury?

Mercury's orbital period around the Sun is about 88 days.  Comets and other things have gotten closer to the Sun than Mercury does.  But has there ever been an asteroid or some other body discovered that has a shorter orbital period?  Are there theoretical constraints on if such a body can exist?
The IAU defines a planet as one that has swept out its orbit.  Does the neighborhood of Mercury extend to the Sun?
