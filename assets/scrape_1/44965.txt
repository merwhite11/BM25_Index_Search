How to determine time when a photo of star trails was taken?

I was asked to define a time (most likely the month) and location of the picture below.

I hope I understood it right that it is the south pole, because we don't see a Polar star in the middle. However, I don't understand how I can know the time.
Could anyone please help me? Thanks in advance.
