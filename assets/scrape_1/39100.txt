When did telescopes become available?

The History of Science and Mathematics stack exchange has a question "When Did Telescopes become Affordable?" asking when telescopes became available to members of the general public instead of wealthy people, professional astronomers, sea captains, and army officers.
And I think that telescopes have become more affordable to the general public over centuries.
So do any amateur astronomers at this site have any information about the history of making telescopes to sell to amateur astronomers?
