Is this definition of tidal locking really satisfying?

We always are hearing this: "If a moon has equal rotational and orbital periods it's tidally locked to its host planet and always one side of it will face to the planet."
But what if, for example, the Moon had an orbital and rotational period of 24 hours? (with the same distance and the same rotational period of the Earth)
Would it be called tidally locked again?
