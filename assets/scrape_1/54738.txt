Is there a maximum practical telescope aperture for viewing (through a filter) a solar eclipse?

I grew up stargazing through various telescopes of increasing aperture sizes, and now that I can afford it, I'm about to invest in a more serious telescope to suit me for decades to come. My primary goals are both planetary and DSO viewing, with some astrophotography, but one thing I'm keeping in mind is next month's annular eclipse and next spring's total eclipse, which I would like to also use my telescope for (with, of course, a certified solar filter IN FRONT OF the aperture lens). (And, also, possible future Mercurial or Venusian transits.)
What I'm wondering is, is there a maximum practical aperture size and/or focal length beyond which you cannot view the entire Sun in the field of view? I understand a good bit about telescope design and mechanics, but I don't pretend to fully understand the science, and I'm wondering if there's a point where the Sun is magnified so much that it more than fills up the field of view of the telescope. (It's possible, of course, that this aperture size and/or focal length is far beyond any sizes I'm considering, in which case it's not a particularly important concern.)
