How to see Mars and Venus in color?

My telescope is Arsenal - Synta 70/700 AZ2 (refractor model). 140x max zoom (10 mm with Barlow).
I could clearly see Jupiter and Saturn in color. I even saw brown stripes on Jupiter.
Yet, when I tried looking at Venus and Mars they appeared pure white, totally washed out by the Sun. I was observing about hour before sunrise.
Is there a way to see them in true color with my current tech? Maybe they could be seen only at certain dates? Or maybe I need some filters?
