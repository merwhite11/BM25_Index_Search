Could a planet theoretically have a stable orbit between Venus and Earth OR Earth and Mars

Take a planet, identical to Earth in size, mass, gravity, rotation, etc.(but without the moon). Could this planet theoretically maintain a stable orbit for many hundreds of millions of years orbiting between Earth and Venus OR Earth and Mars? If so, how much would the inner rocky planets be affected?
