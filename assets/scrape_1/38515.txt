Have Earth, Mars and Jupiter and Neptune not cleared their orbits of space debris?

According National Geographic's Space Encyclopedia (p68, column 3) written and illustrated by David A Aguilar

Pluto has not cleared its orbit of space debris but neither have Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Neptune.

Just like every astronomer they give zero evidence or real explanation for clearing their orbits. NASA just says

An orbit is a regular, repeating path that one object in space takes around another one

This is pretty limiting and every planet must clear its orbit otherwise it would smash into anything in its orbit.
Would anyone like to explain in precise terms what is "around an orbit" and "space debris" and what is clearing of such space debris in respect to Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Neptune- that they have or not done so?
