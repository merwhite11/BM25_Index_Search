How much of the sun needs to be blocked in order to see a noticeable drop in brightness

I live in NYC and just experienced the eclipse. What fascinated me the most was that despite the fact that the sun was about 70% blocked, the area was not noticeably dimmer. If the news wasn't saying there was a solar eclipse I wouldn't have realized it was happening.
How much of the sun needs to be blocked by the moon in order to noticeably dim an area?
