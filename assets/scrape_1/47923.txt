Scaling Relations

In this picture , Keplers third law is written in a scaling relationship with solar mass.
$$a^3=\frac{G(m_1+m_2)}{4\pi^2}P^2 \rightarrow m_1+m_2 = \frac{4\pi^2a^3}{GP^2}$$
$$m_1+m_2=(1 M_{\odot})\, \left( \frac{a}{1\ \text{AU}}\right)^3\,
\left(\frac{P}{1\ \text{year}}\right)^{-2}$$

I'm struggling in these scaling relationships.How that worked?
