Why is the interstellar medium so hot?

On this link, it states the following: "large assemblies of galaxies that are permeated by even larger amounts of diffuse gas. With temperatures of 10 million degrees or more". 
How are these diffused (ionized) gas able to become so hot when they are in large distances from one another and have very little density?
