Has the computed change of the axial tilt ever been measured?

Earth, the 3rd planet from the Sun, sometimes faces earthquakes and seaquakes that are so strong that they reportedly change the axial tilt and/or the rotation velocity. These changes are merely calculated, but have there also been some measurements/experiments that confirmed those calculations? If so, how did they measure it and due to which earth-/seaquake as the cause for the reported changes?
Since Jovian moon Io faces many ioquakes and eruptions too, I'd also like to know whether that happens on Io too and whether it was confirmed by some probe.
