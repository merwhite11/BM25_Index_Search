A question about star names... E.G. CW Tauri, DZ Bootis, IQ Lupi, EU Eridani

Take the following examples of star names/identifications:-
Regulus is the common name for a star.
HIP49669 is the Hipparcos ID for the star
HD87901 is the Henry Daper ID for the star
32 Leonis is the Flamsteed ID for the star
Alpha Leonis is the Bayer ID for the star
And now for a probably unrelated stars at random.
Why and how does stars like 'CW Tauri', 'DZ Bootis', 'IQ Lupi', 'EU Eridani' get their name, is there a catalogue for them?  Who assigns their name? Do they individually mean something or randomly chosen letters?  I'm not just after those stars but all stars with similar style naming.
Thanks in advance
