Where does the relativistic jet on Messier 87 come from?

I'm reading Wikipedia on Messier 87's jet

The relativistic jet of matter emerging from the core [...] consists of matter ejected from a supermassive black hole.

but later in the paragraph:

Its base [...] is probably powered by a prograde accretion disk around the spinning supermassive black hole.

Is the matter that is getting jetted away coming from inside of the black hole itself, or is it from matter that's just outside of the black hole?
