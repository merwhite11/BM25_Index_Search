Is there any way a planet could form independent of a star?

I just recently heard that there are currently no theoretical models that support planet formation without a star, but I can't remember where. So, I thought I would request all of your expertises. Thank you much. I wanted to confirm whether this is true or not and to know if there are any theories that could account for planet formation in interstellar or intergalactic space.
