Where's the matter that created the CMB?

I know that the CMB was created at the recombination, when photons could finally travel freely. But each of those photons was deflected one last time before this happened. Where's the matter that deflected the photons? Has it become the baryonic matter we see around us, or has it crossed the cosmic event horizon?
