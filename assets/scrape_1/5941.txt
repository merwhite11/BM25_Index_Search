Would an ultra bright moon indicate that the world is ending?

There is a sci-fi television episode that shows a man looking out the window into the night sky. There up in the sky is the moon, and it's extraordinarily bright.
The man spends the rest of the night trying to do all the things he wish he had done in his life. A race to experience life before the morning sunrise.
His conclusion; A giant solar flare has erupted, and the side of the Earth facing the sun has been burned away. The world is ending....
How plausible is this story?
Could a solar flare burn the Earth? and if you happen to be on the dark side when it happens. Would the moon be a reliable indicator?
