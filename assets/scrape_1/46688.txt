If all objects move, where do we go?

Yes I know that the sun and planets in the solar system travel fast with an average speed of 448,000 mph.

Are we going to the center of the galaxy? If so, does that mean our galaxy is getting smaller (because all objects will be centered)?
And do galaxies also travel fast to somewhere (like the solar system)?
