what is the highest throughput astronomy project in pixels?

I was having a discussing about big scientific projects with colleagues, and I postulated that astronomy is still one of the scientific fields with biggest projects per amount of data dealt with, after the high-energy physics.
I would like to know what is the highest throughput astronomy project as defined by the number of pixels in the images analysed in the project.
Something like "project XYZ" with an estimated "1.2 trillion pixels" worth of pictures taked and analysed over 5 years.
