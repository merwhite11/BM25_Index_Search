What are those blobs in each of the two bright rings of Neptune shown in the new JWST image?

What is this bright blue object taken by the Webb telescope? includes the new JWST infrared image of Neptune and Triton. The disk of Neptune shows interesting features but I'm drawn to Neptunes's rings. I see two and in each ring there is a "blob".
I'm no ring expert, but from what I remember from the up-close Cassini images of Saturn, moons and rings are like oil and water; they don't mix. In this case that means that the orbit of a moon is usually swept clean of ring material by gravitational perturbations; ring particles need to have a slightly faster or slower period to avoid 1:1 (and perhaps other complex relationships) resonance.
So I'd like to ask:
Question: What are those blobs in each of the two bright rings of Neptune shown in the new JWST image?
If they do turn out to be Moons please help me understand why the rings appear to coincide with the moons' positions rather than  fall between them to avoid resonances.
