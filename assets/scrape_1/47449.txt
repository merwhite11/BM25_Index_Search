If we could fly off edge of observable universe what would happen?

If we could be at the edge of expanding universe in a fast space ship such that we could go beyond the edge, what does the science think we might experience?
Would we still be floating in space?
Would we be pushed or pulled?
Would the observable universe go out of view until it caught up?
Would there be light, dark, or a clear and shining void?
Would we cease to exist until existence caught back up?
