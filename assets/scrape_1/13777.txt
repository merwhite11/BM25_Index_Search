visualisation of galaxy density

If I had a long stick that was millions of light years long, and with a width of about the Sun, and I then swiped it through the center of the milky way galaxy, what would the probability be of me hitting a star?
EDIT:

Ignore the speed of light. Assume it is possible to just swipe it through instantaneiously.
Assume that the stars in the galaxy are equally distributed. Obviously if you were to swipe right through the middle you would hit the galactic center.
The purpose of this thought experiment is just to help visualise the density vs size of the galaxy.
