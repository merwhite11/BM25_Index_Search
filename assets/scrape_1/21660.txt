Does Ganymede have a day/night cycle? If so, what does it look like?

Over on the SF & Fantasy Stack, I've asked a question about a curious watch that shows 15 intervals on its watch face instead of the usual 12 hours. That watch belongs to someone living on Ganymede, close to the end of the 21st century.
Why does Jet's old watch show 15 hours?
Does Ganymede have any day/night cycle, or any other cycle, that would explain this curious watch?
In analogy to earth, we should expect a 30-hour Ganymede-day. But Ganymede is in tidal lock, always showing its same side to Jupiter. Also, calculations show that the light reflected by Jupiter pales compared to that of the sun.
So I would assume that Ganymede's day/night cycle is sun based, possibly complicated by passing through Jupiter's shadow.
What do day and night on Ganymede look like?
