Is the Sun in our solar system moving or stationary?

When I was small, I read that Sun is fixed at the center of the solar system and that all the other planets rotate around it.
But later I heard that even the Sun is not fixed; it moves. Is this true?
Why had people previously thought that the Sun is fixed?
Is this correct planets in helix path or spring like path?
