Estimating inner and outer boundaries of habitable zone for Sun

What would the inner and outer boundaries of the “habitable zone” be for planets with an albedo that differs from that of the Earth?
For example a planet with an albedo of 0.07 or 0.90 (the values for Mercury and Venus, respectively). 
I want to compare these values to the distances in AU's of the rocky inner planets.
