What's the reason for the hollow region in Oort cloud?

Can someone please tell what caused the hollow space (pointed by yellow arrow) in the Oort Cloud?
I understand that it is called cloud because the cluster of objects does not align with the major rotation axis of our Sun. But, I could not find information on anywhere what caused the hollow space.
Thank you.
