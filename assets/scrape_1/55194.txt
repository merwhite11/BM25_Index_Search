Can you identify the source of this image of the Pacman Nebula (NGC 281)?

Months ago I downloaded this glorious image of the Pacman Nebula (NGC 281) in Cassiopeia. I have not been able to identify the source of the image (e.g., Hubble, James Webb Space Telescope, etc.) and other information such as the date of the exposure, what cameras were used, and whether it is in the public domain or copyright protected. I've poked around using Google Lens and with web searches to find this information but so far without success. I trust that the knowledgeable folks here might help. Thank you. wakkawakkawakka
