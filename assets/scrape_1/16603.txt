Observed data: Why so many MPECs about TNOs lately?

The Minor Planet Electronic Circulars (MPECs)
for July 15 through July 18 reported an unusually high number of re-observations of known trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs).
These were found in the
Pan-STARRS archive;
most had not otherwise been observed since discovery.
Is this activity part of the search for Planet 9,
another observing program such as OSSOS,
a result of software improvements,
or just someone clearing a backlog?
