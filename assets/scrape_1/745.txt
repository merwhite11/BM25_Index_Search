Why are some planets so close to their star?


"Kepler-10b orbits its parent star once every 0.84 days, which means
  it is more than 20 times closer to its star than Mercury is to our
  sun" space.com

Are there any accepted theories that successfully predicted that so many planets would be found so close to their star?  
Edit: This is especially a question, since it seems that planets are moving away from their star. newscientist.com
