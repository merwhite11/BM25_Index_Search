How can I know the names of the stars in the Hipparcos Catalogue?

Yes, I know that not all the stars in the Hipparcos catalogue has a name.
I have found that, the following catalogue has some stars' names:

(HR)  Bright Star Catalogue, 5th Revised Ed. (Hoffleit+, 1991) (V/50)

But, do you know where I can find the Greek letters of the stars?
Maybe, there is a catalogue in which I can use the HIP number to get the star's Greek letter.
