How would the synodic period of Venus appear to change if both planets were moved 10 million additional miles away from the Sun?

Let us say that Earth and Venus are both moved 10 million additional miles from the sun. How would the synodic period of Venus appear to change for an observer on Earth? If 584 days is Venus' current synodic period, how many days would elapse if the planets were adjusted as mentioned?
Thank you so much for your help! Math to help me do it myself is most welcome!
