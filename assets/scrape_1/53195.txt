Display the lines of solar altitude on the map

Following this question:
Calculate lines of equal solar altitude
I would like to have the possibility of displaying the lines of equal solar altitude on the map as per the image below:

including also the values below the horizon.
Is there any software or (for example) Pythin library, which could do something like this?
