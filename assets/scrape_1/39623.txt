How bright is it on Pluto in the middle of the day?

I just saw a documentary about New Horizons and Pluto with plenty of photos New Horizon had taken of Pluto. All these photos were very bright, like Earth would be during the day. Considering the distance between Pluto and the sun I suspect the brightness of the photos has been manipulated.
So, if you would be standing on Pluto's equator when the sun is in zenit, how bright would it be?
