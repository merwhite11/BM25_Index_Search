How can an amateur astronomer verify the position of near Earth objects?

Sometimes, hobby-astronomers use rather professional means to observe the big voids of space. Every now and then (think in months, not days) even I can locate an NEO (near Earth object).
Now, I'm assuming governments and institutions worldwide track such NEOs, have the best options to observe them, and most probably accumulated more data than we could wish for.
For hobby-astronomers who spot an NEO, it could be of interest to verify the location of the spotted NEO, and maybe even learn more about a specific NEO from additional data like name, type, path, direction, speed, first observed, etc.
Is there any publicly available, NEO-related database out there? Or is there a specific institution a hobby-astronomer can/should turn to to be able to learn more about individual NEOs?
