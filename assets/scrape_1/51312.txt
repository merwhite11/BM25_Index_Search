Deriving orbital inclination from equatorial coordinates?

I wanted to ask if it's possible to establish a correlation between the observed equatorial coordinates of a Solar System planet, especially declination, and the planet's orbital inclination with respect to the ecliptic.
In case there is such correlation, would it be possible, for example, to derive the orbital inclination of an outer planet by comparing its declination angles observed at different times?
