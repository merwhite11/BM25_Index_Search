How long before two sidereal months start on the same lunar phase?

I was reading about the difference between the sidereal and synodic month when I started to wonder how many sidereal months need to pass before you get two that start on the same part of the synodic month or lunar phase.
I've tried looking on Wikipedia and googling around a bit and haven't turned anything up so I'm hoping someone here can help me.
Thanks in advance!
