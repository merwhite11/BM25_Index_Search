Has optical interferometry been done at radio frequency using heterodyning with a laser in a nonlinear material?

If one collects narrow band optical emission from a large telescope with frequency $f_1$ and mixes it in a nonlinear crystal with laser light of a nearby frequency $f_2$, it would produce two new signals at $|f_1+f_2|$ and  $|f_1-f_2|$.
The difference signal $|f_1-f_2|$ could be picked up electromagnetically or perhaps it would be detectable as an AC component in a photodetector somehow, perhaps the photodetector would be the nonlinear element itself.
Once the signal is electrical, it could be recorded for later playback and offline interferometry, or for transmission over large distances for large baseline optical interferometry, or both.
Is this "a thing"? Has anything like this been done or at least tried?
