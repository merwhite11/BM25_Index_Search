Distance between "inside" and "outside" of the sun?

In a solar eclipse, and from our distance, the sun's surface appears to be pretty much exactly that, a surface.  However, the reality of it's being an extremely tenuous plasma makes things very much different, even under 28 times the force of Earth's gravity.  My question might be: What is the elevation difference between a point where 99.9% percent of the light is coming from below, and another point which is completely "submerged" within the sun, with light flux equal in all directions?  What about for other parts of the spectrum?  Is that how the thickness of the photosphere is defined?  In a related question, is there any topographic relief to be seen between the centers and edges of solar convection granules, even if only a few centimeters?
