Recurring flying object near the Big Dipper

This evening I was watching the Big Dipper when I noticed a bright-enough object (it looked either like a satellite or a really slow shooting star) a little above the line that connects Dubhe and Megrez. It was visible for maybe 1.5 - 2 seconds, proceeding on a straight line out of the Dipper, and then disappeared.
I thought it was a satellite, but why did it disappear? There was not a cloud in the sky, so it couldn't have been hidden. Anyway, oddly enough, half a minute or less later there it was again. It started at the same place and goes AWOL in the same place. Now that was puzzling. But even more, I waited another half a minute and it appeared again for a third time. I was astonished - what could do that?
I'm not an expert, but I would rule out a satellite for the repetition of the trajectory in such a short time frame, as well as the shooting start as slow and impossible to have three in the same place at such a close timing. But what else?? Any clue? This is to me as close to UFO as I could ever realistically think about.
