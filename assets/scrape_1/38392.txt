How much (more or less) of the moon will be visible as it recedes from the Earth?

The Moon is receding from the Earth, at a rate of about 4 cm per year. We can currently see about 59% of the Moon's surface, from the Earth's surface.
Will the amount of the Moon's surface we can see from Earth change (significantly) as the Moon recedes?
