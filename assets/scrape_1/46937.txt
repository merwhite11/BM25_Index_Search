Where can I build my house on Mercury so that I can see double sunsets (and sunrises)? Can I do it near the poles where it's cooler?

CNN'S Mercury mission flies by closest planet to the sun for the first time says at the end:

Mercury's unusual rotation and oval-shaped orbit around the sun (sic) means our star seems to quickly rise, set and rise again on some parts of the planet, and a similar phenomenon occurs at sunset.

When I build my dream home on Mercury, I want that! I want to see this rise-set-rise, set-rise-set every single day! :-)
But I also don't want my place to get too hot during the day, so I'd like to live closer to the poles where I can step outside without my boots quickly melting.
Question: Where can I build my house on Mercury so that I can see double sunsets (and sunrises)? Can I do it near the poles where it's cooler?
Is there a map? Or some equations based on latitude and longitude that define the areas where this happen? Is the rise-set-rise area exactly the same as the set-rise-set area?
