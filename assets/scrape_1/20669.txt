Pleiades galactic coordinates

Is there a practical way to determine the galactic coordinates directly from the equatorial system? 
Specifically, I can't find the $(l,b)$ for the Pleiades star cluster (M45) anywhere. I am trying to determine if they reside in the thick disk or in the thin disk. 
(I am assuming these are the possible options, since the halo mainly contains globular clusters and the bulge is too messy so that the Pleiades wouldn't be so noticeable.)
