What are the stages in the life of a universe?

Geological periods describe varying phases in the last few hundred million years on earth.
Are there any names for the periods on a timescale 1-2 orders of magnitude greater, that is, for the stages of a/the universe?
I found some bits and pieces of information but nothing as clear as I did for geological periods, possibly because of the conjecture involved.
