Latest sunrise/earliest sunset out of phase with solstice?

Everybody knows that the shortest and longest days of the year occur on the solstices.  However, examination of sunrise/sunset tables shows that the maxima and minima of sunrise/sunset times are offset from the solstices by about 10 days. 
According to timeanddate.com for my location (Portland, OR), for the winter solstice, the earliest sunset is about December 10 (16:27), and the latest sunrise is around January 1 (07:51).
This is counterintuitive... what's the explanation?
