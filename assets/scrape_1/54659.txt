Attachment for viewing the sun with a telescope

In 2016 I got to see the transit of Mercury thanks to a group of volunteer astronomers. The astronomer had a device attached to the telescope eyepiece that allowed the light to project onto frosted glass.
I’d like to get such a device for my own telescope for viewing the next two solar eclipses, but I don’t know what this device is called. I’ve Googled various things, but I’ve had no luck.
