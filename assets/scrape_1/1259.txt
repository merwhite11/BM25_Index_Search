Why can you see the space station on some days but not on others?

In my area, from December 17th - 26th, you can see the space station every day, twice

But from December 27th - January 6th, you can only see it twice

My question is, why does it appear for almost the whole month of December, and then not appear for a few days? Is it based on my location? I live in Alberta, Canada if that helps.
