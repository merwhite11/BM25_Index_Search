How would a celestial map for Callisto depict the paths of Jupiter, the Sun, etc.?

Let's say we're mapping Callisto's northern celestial hemisphere in a way similar to this map of Earth's.
Along with the stars (which let's just ignore for this question), this map will identify the paths of four objects:

The Sun
Jupiter
Ganymede (closer to Jupiter)
Himalia (farther from Jupiter)

Where on the map would these objects' paths be? Or at least how would I find the exact answers with math/software/etc.?
My assumptions/guesses:

Jupiter's path is relatively similar to the ecliptic but Callisto's orbital inclination or maybe Jupiter's might separate the two
Jupiter's moons are within a similar orbital plane to Callisto and would follow near Jupiter's path
the distance Callisto travels away from the sun in its own orbit is insignificant in determining the shape of the ecliptic

I have no idea if the axial tilt of Callisto or Jupiter would affect anything but it probably does.
If it helps, I've made this incredibly stylish and oh-so-fabulous template in case anyone wants to sketch it in Paint or something. The black dot at the center is the celestial north pole.

Thank you for your time!
