If the Universe has a positive curvature and a closed spatial geometry, does it therefore have a finite volume and a geometric center?

Based on the recent Planck Legacy 2018 release confirming the presence of an enhanced lensing amplitude in the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra compared to that predicted by the standard ΛCDM model, several
authors (Di Valentino et al. (2022), Efstathiou & Gratton (2020), Handley (2019)) have proposed that the Universe
is spatially closed, with a positive curvature . A positive curvature of the Universe presents some tension with the
standard model, which Di Valentino et al. (2022) couch in terms of a "possible crisis in cosmology".
The value of Ω is of interest because it determines the form of the evolution of an expanding universe (Eingorn et al.,
2019). Based on the ΛCDM model, Ω will have a negligible effect on expansion for early
times, but becomes predominate at successively later times. For  < 0 expansion will continue forever. For  = 0
expansion will continue forever, but the rate will approach zero asymptotically as  goes to infinity. Indefinite expansion implies
that the Universe must be unbounded and have an infinite volume, and thus posses no center. For  > 0 expansion will
halt at some time  and reverse itself due to the inexorable tug of gravity. This implies that the Universe would have a
finite volume. It is claimed that a bounded surface with a finite volume has a geometric center (centroid) which is the arithmetic mean
of all points on the surface (Lovett, 2019).
Is this claim true?
