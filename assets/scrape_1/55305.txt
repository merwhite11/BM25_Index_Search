Could the human body feel the sudden disappearance or end of a gravitational force?

For example, if the Sun suddenly disappeared, would we physically feel it 8 minutes later (not counting light/temperature), since propagates moves at the speed of light.
And if so, would the effect be noticeably different depending on size/distance?
Every answer I've seen so far is mostly about light and/or temperature, or our orbit. I am talking specifically about what the average person would feel in their body (like a drop or lurch or jolt).
