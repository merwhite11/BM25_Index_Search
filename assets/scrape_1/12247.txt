Is axial tilt critical for life?

According to this explanation at the Georgia State University website, 

Axis Tilt is Critical for Life
. . .
The Earth's spin axis is tilted 23.5Â° with respect to the ecliptic, giving moderate seasons and preventing temperature extremes anywhere on the planet. . . . Not only is the Earth's angle of tilt close to the optimum value, it also seems to have been essentially constant. That is crucial for the development of advanced life. 

Is this claim correct?

Why does it matter if there are some areas of a planet with extreme temperatures, as long as there are other spots on the planet that are not extreme?
Why are "moderate" seasons required for life to exist?
If humans can live at the equator on Earth where there is the least amount of tilt, why would an exoplanet with less tilt or no tilt be necessarily non-inhabitable?
Even if humans could not live on a planet without axial tilt, are there no other forms of known "advanced" life that can? We know that extremophiles exist, such as tardigrades' ability to survive in the vacuum of space.  What is the most "advanced life" that could live on a planet without axial tilt?
