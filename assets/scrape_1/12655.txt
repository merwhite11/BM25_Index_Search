Plausible? Brown Dwarfs are rogue celestial bodies because they absorb all light due to their thick layer of matte black soot

My theory of why Brown Dwarfs are the rogue celestial bodies that travel through galaxies without a set course. My first theory would be their matte black in color due to a layer of soot.Light does not reflect off a thick layer of black powdered soot,The light is absorbed fully making it impossible to view in a color light spectrum.Second these giants are iron all the way through making its mass weight extremely dense in proportion to its volume.Third They are extremely   cold having no energy to burn,some might be completely dead giving off no heat and would be almost impossible to capture but by chance with FIR technology heating a spot up and captured with IR.These dead cold Dwarfs might even be completely stationary in a solar system having no momentum from photon light scattering.Some might have collided with a plant causing velocity momentum and set to a linear path.Some might be smoldering out still emitting some FIR radiation making a small gap to be captured by IR technology.They can travel through solar systems or galaxies as pleased with little interference of gravity from planets due to its extreme mass weight,until it transcends extremely close to an active star and slingshotted around the star,Now hot and glowing the Brown Dwarf can be seen through color spectrum and will radiate FIR.
Could this theory be plausible? If not describe with links to creditable data no pictures or diagrams.
