Will a 10mm eyepiece with a barlow 2x produce the same result as a 5mm eyepiece?

So I have been wondering if a barlow (say 2x) will produce the same result of a half eyepiece....
So would a 10mm with a 2X Barlow produce the same result as a 5mm? (Assuming the FOV is the same on the 10mm and the 5mm)....
Since I dont have any combination that would be "equivalent" I cant test the result
