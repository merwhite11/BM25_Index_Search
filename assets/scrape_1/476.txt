Why does the Moon stablize Earth's axis?

In an academic study titled 'The Moon and the Origin of Life on Earth'  it is said that 

'If the Moon did not exist, the orientation of the Earthâ€™s axis would not be stable, and would be subject to large chaotic variations over the ages. The resulting climatic changes very likely would have markedly disturbed the development of organized life'.

Since I don't have enough physics and mathematics knowledge in order to understand why the Moon stabilizes the Earth's axis, can anybody explain in simple words this phenomenon?
