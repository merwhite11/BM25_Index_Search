Can angular information be known more precisely than the diffraction limit?

The diffraction limit deals with the ability to determine if two things are separate.  I am interested in the ability to find the the centroid of a single object.  
Imagine a star with no near neighbors would it be possible to determine the centroid of that star at a resolution higher than the diffraction limit?
The star is essentially a point source and I wonder if looking at the edges of the airy disk would allow a centroid to be determined if I had a magical camera with infinite pixels.
It seems to me that I should be able to see the disk and then calculate a centroid that is smaller than the airy disk.
Thanks for any help you can provide =)
