Mapping selenographic coordinates onto a sphere

I have created a 3D rendering of the moon, which is represented as a sphere with a radius of N pixels.
I also have selenographic coordinates.  For example, the coordinates of the Apollo 11 landing site are 0.67408, 23.47297.  I'd like to show this coordinate on my sphere.
Here's some possibly relevant code, which is used for conversion with Earth coordinates:
function latLongToVector3(lat, lon, radius, height) {
    var phi = (lat)*Math.PI/180;
    var theta = (lon-180)*Math.PI/180;

    var x = -(radius+height) * Math.cos(phi) * Math.cos(theta);
    var y = (radius+height) * Math.sin(phi);
    var z = (radius+height) * Math.cos(phi) * Math.sin(theta);

    return new THREE.Vector3(x,y,z);
}

Is this the correct way to map selenographic coordinates onto a sphere?
