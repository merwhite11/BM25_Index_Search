Are there lightning bolts on Mars?

Although the Martian atmosphere is thin, there are many atmospheric phenomena that occur on Mars: storms, dust devils, (carbon dioxide) snow,... Some storms even stir up the atmosphere of the entire planet!
During Martian storms, is there any lightning and thunder, like what we see during Earth storms? What about in the past, when atmospheric conditions were different, has there ever been any lightning on Mars?
