Problem in converting equatoral coordinates to ecliptic coordinates

I would like to convert equatoral coordinates to ecliptique coordinates. I am following the source below:
Practical Astronomy with Your Calculator
The formula I am using is:


When I solve this example, I find the same value. And I am checking the result using the website below:
https://frostydrew.org/utilities.dc/convert/tool-eq_coordinates/


As you see the results are same.
However when I want to find the ecliptic coordinates of Sagittarius A, I am getting different results:
Right Ascension of Sagittarius A is: 17h 45m 40.0409s
Declination of Sagittarius A is: −29° 0′ 28.118″
I found the results in the previous example with the following program, and the result was the same when I encountered the results on the site I mentioned to you.
I tried the same Python program this time to find the ecliptic coordinates of Sagittarius A, but the results were very different from the results on the site I mentioned.
from math import cos, sin, tan, asin, atan, radians, degrees


def dd_to_dms(dd):
    degree = int(dd)
    minute = int((dd - degree) * 60)
    second = round(float((dd - degree - minute / 60) * 3600))
    return f"{degree}\u00b0 {minute}\' {second}\""


def dms_to_dd(dms):
    dms = dms.replace("\u00b0", " ").replace("\'", " ").replace("\"", " ")
    degree = int(dms.split(" ")[0])
    minute = float(dms.split(" ")[1]) / 60
    second = float(dms.split(" ")[2]) / 3600
    return degree + minute + second


def from_equatoral_to_ecliptique(ra, dec, ob):
    ob = dms_to_dd(ob)
    ra = dms_to_dd(ra) * 15
    dec = dms_to_dd(dec)
    lat = (sin(radians(ra)) * cos(radians(ob)) + tan(radians(dec)) * sin(radians(ob))) / cos(radians(ra))
    lon = sin(radians(dec)) * cos(radians(ob)) - cos(radians(dec)) * sin(radians(ra)) * sin(radians(ob))
    return degrees(atan(lat)), degrees(asin(lon))


x, y = from_equatoral_to_ecliptique(
    ra="17°45'40.0409\"",
    dec="-29°0'28.118",
    ob="23°26'0\""
)
print(x, y)

When I run this program, I am getting the results below:
86.85130704210478 -5.598002197452088

In order to remove the ambiguity of the longitude value, as mentioned in the article I shared with you, I am adding 180 degrees to the result. But when I add 180, the longitude value becomes 174.40199780254792
But when I check this value using the website I mentioned, I am seeing that the result equals to 264.862492.


I wonder what I am missing while trying to find the ecliptic coordinates of Sagittarius A. And I would like learn why I found the result similar in the first example but different in the second example.
Thanks in advance.
