Does the inverse of gravity exists?

I am not talking about an antigravity effect that would cancel gravity, rather if there is a repulsive force, like when you use two magnets and flip one of them, where it becomes obvious that one is pushing away the other.
Hope the question is a good fit for the site, feel free to migrate it otherwise.
