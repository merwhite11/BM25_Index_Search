Do any equivalent of Lagrange points exist between galaxies?

I'm wondering whether there is a similar effect between Galaxies as we have between a planet and it's star. I know there are tidal waves between galaxies and that gravity seems to always be attractive therefore, there should be Lagrange like points between Galaxies.
However, the tidal waves seem to wrack havoc galaxies so I could imagine that no such stable points would exist, at least not for long (a few million years maybe?)
Is that at all possible?
