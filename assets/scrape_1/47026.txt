Structures on the Far Side of the Moon?

I downloaded an image of the far side of the moon using Google Earth. It is an area to the North West of the Mare Moscoviense (lat 27.3$^{\circ}$ lon 147.9$^{\circ}$)
What are the dot-like structures inside the right edge of the crater?
There are also three dots inside the small crater to the South East of the large crater making an equilateral triangle.
Are they real or are they photo artifacts?
I couldn't find any similar dot-like structures on the near side of the moon.

Some larger linear structures in craters
