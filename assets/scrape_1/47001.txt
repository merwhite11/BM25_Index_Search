Lagrange points for bodies in elliptical orbits?

Lagrange points are points of relative stability near the orbit of another, more massive body. Most of the examples of such points regard orbits with relatively low eccentricity. However, after messing with simple nbody simulations, I have been having trouble with recreating restricted 3-body systems where the secondary ($M\geq25m$) is in a highly eccentric orbit ($e>0.7$) and the tertiary is in some Lagrange point around the secondary. Is any Lagrange point in this scenario unstable, or are there special cases which work? If the latter is true, which range of mass ratios and orbital eccentricities (w/o semimajor axis) result in relatively stable (or mostly metastable) orbital configurations with lifetimes of at least half of a L1/2/3 for a circular orbit?
