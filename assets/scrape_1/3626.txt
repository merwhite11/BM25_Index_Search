Connection between Earth, Moon, Theia, and asteroid belt?

Are there other fragments aside from the Moon that resulted from the collision of Earth and "Theia" (as it's called in recent main-stream press stories)?  And if not, why not?  And what happened to "Theia" (like where did it go)?
Has there been any consideration or hypothesizing that Earth may have had a larger orbit (say between Mars/Jupiter) until a large body (Theia) bashed into it, sending Earth closer to the sun along with its new satellite, while also creating the asteroid-belt?  Could something like Ceres be the missing "Theia"?
I know it sounds a bit far-fetched, but then so does the whole concept of the Moon being born from a planet collision with Earth? (With very little evidence to back it up, at least till recently).
