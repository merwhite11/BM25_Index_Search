Why does gas form a star instead of a black hole?

When a space gas gets pulled together a star is formed. On the other hand, when a massive star dies, it collapses to a black hole. 
You would think that the initial mass of the gas would be bigger than the star that had existed for billion years and lost mass in the process.
So what stopped the space gas from forming a black hole in the first place?
