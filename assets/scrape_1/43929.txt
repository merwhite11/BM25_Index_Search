What is meant by "revolution of Sun's apogee"?

While reading Translation of the Surya Siddhanta and of the Siddhanta Siromani(1861) - Bapu Deva Shastri, I stuck in the follwing.
Chapter I, verse 41 & 42

In a KALPA (4.32 billion years), there are 387 revolutions of the Sun's Apogee (about the earth), 204 of Mars' apogee, 368 of Mercury's apogee, 900 of Jupiter's apogee, 535 of Venus' apogee and 39 of Saturn's apogee.

Now my question is what is meant by 387 revolution of Sun's apogee? It will be helpful if someone can explain this.
This is the same question I have asked here, but as not getting proper explanation I am posting here too.
