How can I id this celestial without data?

Anecdotal. Also, I'm using the term 'celestial' loosely; to mean something shiny in the skies.
I'm based out of Nagpur in Central India. Sleeping outdoors on account of summer over the last few days I've made a weird observation. No matter what time it is, there is a fairly bright body visible in the NNW skies at an elevation of perhaps 20 degrees. From what little I gather a GSO object would be really dim, or even invisible. A LEO couldn't be in GSO unless it was in powered flight. I'm utterly flummoxed. The only reason I haven't seen it before is because earlier in life I would sleep outdoors on the balcony where this particular field of view is blocked by other structures around. Sleeping on the ground floor there is a field of view not available on the first floor. Adjacent buildings blocking the view on the first floor also act as a reference that the position of this object has not changed no matter what time of the night it is.
My location (from Google Maps) is 21.17103958702249, 79.08452532230748
The general direction where this object is visible is due 21.171644779275333, 79.08410335986589
How can I id this object?
