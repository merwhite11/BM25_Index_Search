Conversion to Jy of Hubble WFC3 units (electrons/s) and of Spitzer IRAC (MJy/sr)

I am trying to figure out how to convert the units of some FITS files to Jy. These files refer to observations in different bands using different instruments. I list them below with my way of converting the units. Notice that the second procedure is similar to another question (here: Astronomical data convertion from Jy/pixel to MJy/sr?).

HST observations with the camera WFC3 using the filter F160W and others. In this case, I found "BUNIT   = 'ELECTRONS/S' / brightness units" in the file header. So, to pass from e/s to Jy, I did the following: first, thanks to HST website info (https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/acs/data-analysis/zeropoints), I multiplied each pixel value for the PHOTFLAM=$9.9138 \times 10^{-20}$ (inverse sensitivity in units of $erg \space cm^{-2} Å^{-1} e^{-1}$) to obtain the flux density in terms of wavelength ($erg \space s^{-1} cm^{-2} Å^{-1}$), then I multiplied the result for the factor $\lambda^{2}/c$ to get the flux density in terms of the frequency ($erg \space s^{-1} cm^{-2} Hz^{-1}$). Finally, I multiplied the result for $10^{23}$ to convert these units into Jy. All the procedure can be summarized by saying that, considering a wavelength in microns, to pass from HST units to Jy, I should multiply for the constant $3.305 \times 10^{7}$ and for the square of lambda, which I set as the central wavelength of the filter (e.g., 1.5396 microns fo F160W).

Spitzer IRAC, channels from 1 to 4. I can read on the website (7th question, here: https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/knowledgebase/spitzer_irac.html):"If you want to convert 'MJy/sr into flux density/pixel units, you can convert steradians into arcseconds squared, and then multiply by the area of the pixel. Remember that in BCDs the pixel area is approximately 1.22 arcseconds squared, whereas in the pipeline mosaic the pixelsize by default is 0.6 arcseconds squared exactly. So, for example, for the pipeline mosaic a pixel value needs to be multiplied by (1E12 micro-Jy)/(4.254517E10 arcsec**2) x 0.6 arcsec x 0.6 arcsec = 8.461595 to obtain micro-Jy/pixel flux densities.". So, I confirm the units of the files' header "BUNIT  = 'MJy/sr' / Units of image data (MJy/sr)" for all channels, and, given the above explanation, I understand that I do not need the FLUXCONV values. Just in case, they are channel 1: "FLUXCONV= 0.1069 / Flux Conv. factor (MJy/sr per DN/sec)"; channel 2: "FLUXCONV= 0.1382 / Flux Conv. factor (MJy/sr per DN/sec)"; channel 3: "FLUXCONV= 0.5858 / Flux Conv. factor (MJy/sr per DN/sec)"; channel 4: "FLUXCONV= 0.2026 / Flux Conv. factor (MJy/sr per DN/sec)". I only need to measure the pixel size on the image, which is 0.6 arcseconds for all four images. So I should multiply the pixel value (in MJy/sr)  for the constant $8.461595 \times 10^2$ to obtain the value in Jy.


What do you think about my solutions? What about using the HST filter's central wavelength as the lambda value? I would appreciate any idea/confirmation of the procedure. Thank you very much for your help.
