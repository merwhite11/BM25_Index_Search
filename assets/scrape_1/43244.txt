Is S2 still the fastest known star in the galaxy?

Wikipedia's entry for the star S2 says that it has

the fastest known ballistic orbit, reaching speeds exceeding 5,000
km/s (11,000,000 mph, or ​1⁄60 the speed of light) and acceleration of
about 1.5 m/s2 (almost one-sixth of Earth's surface gravity).

But the referenced link to the press release Surfing a Black Hole is dated 2002.  Have any stars with faster orbital speeds at perimelasma (periapsis for a black hole orbit) in the 19 years since this press release?  Is it possible that there is a star on an even faster orbital trajectory than S2 or has any such possibility been ruled out?
