Why is the Earth's magnetic field stronger than its neighbors?

[Edited] I've learned that the Earth's core is hot due to decay of radioactive elements, causing the liquid part of the core to stay liquid. This was stated as an explanation to why the Earth has a strong magnetic field.
Assuming the rocky planets were formed roughly the same way (planetoid collisions etc.), why was Earth the "lucky winner" of abundant radioactive elements, while Mars & Venus were left with much less, causing their cores to solidify, their magnetic fields to weaken, their water blown into space, and their fate sealed to become arid desert and boiling inferno, respectively?
