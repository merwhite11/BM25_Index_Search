Multiple very small, very low visibility moving stars?

I've been seeing these very small star like objects cross the sky for a couple months now. I notice that I see the them in clusters, for instance I see 2 one day and then another the next, and then I don't see any for another month or so. I assumed it was the space station until I saw another moving behind the first one I saw, and it was moving in the same general direct but clearly at a different angle. Just tonight I was Watching two as usual for about 10 seconds until one just zips around like a shooting star? Assuming it was a shooting star but I have my doubts.
