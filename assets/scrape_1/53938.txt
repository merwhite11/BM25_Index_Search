If two asteroids will collide, how can we call it?

If a smaller celestial body collides with a larger celestial body, but neither is classified as a planet, what do we call the smaller celestial body that collided with the larger one?
Asteroid/meteoroid or meteor/meteorite?
Do we call it asteroid collision or meteorite collision from the smaller to the greater?
Is there any logic in saying "meteor" even when there is virtually no atmosphere involved?
