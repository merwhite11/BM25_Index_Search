Is it possible that Planet 9 was thrown out of the Solar System?

Is it possible that this planet changed other planet orbits (from which we assume that it exists) but then was thrown out of the Solar System in past when Sun was close to some other star? And it doesn't exist in our system anymore and we can't find it because of it.
