Who found the existence of Dark Matter?

Dark Matter's observational evidence is widely attributed to Vera Rubin based on her observation of galaxy rotation curves with Kent Ford in 1970s, which was later confirmed by Albert Bosma in 1978. 
However, it was in the late 1930s that Fritz Zwicky inferred the presence of dark matter based on his observations of Coma galaxy cluster using the virial theorem. Herein lies my confusion. Why does the scientific community and people, in general, give credits to Vera Rubin instead of Zwicky for inferring/observing the evidence for dark matter? Or, is the recognition given because she independently strengthened Zwicky's observation thereby confirming the existence of dark matter?
