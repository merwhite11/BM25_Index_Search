Question related to Sun rise and Sun set times

I am not sure whether this question is right or not so bear with me.
I understand 'Sun rise' and 'Sun set' is caused by the Earth's rotation.
I read that 'Sun light' takes around 8 minutes to reach Earth.
Every city in the world has its own 'Sun rise and Sun set' timings. 
Lets assume the 'Sun rises' at 6 AM in 'City A'.  
Does this mean that 'City A' sees/feels the light of the Sun which was in the sky @ 5:52 AM ?
In other words, does 'Sun rise' and 'Sun set' timings change according to 'light years'?
