How clear will the images taken by the JWST be, compared to the rest of the telescopes?

How clear will the James Webb Space Telescope images be compared to other telescopes?
I mean mainly for things like:

Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, or Quaoar
Ceres, Juno, Vesta or Astraea
exoplanet HIP 65426 b and other exoplanets
