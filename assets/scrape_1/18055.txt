Where can I find a solar eclipse calendar compatible with Google Calendar?

For planning purposes it would be good to have a calendar of upcoming (at least some years) solar eclipses. The closest thing I've been able to find has too many other events in it to be useful. A similar calendar is no longer reachable.
