SExtractor parameters for identifying Star Forming regions

I am using SExtractor (Source Extractor) to identify Star-Forming regions in a galaxy. The problem is I am unable to choose the parameters required for it. SExtractor is just a tool to identify the sources in a field. These can be point sources as well as extended diffuse sources. So it is not clear how to go about applying the sextractor and then isolating/identifying only the extended regions as the star-forming regions.  Basically, why and how to choose the extent of 'X' pixels?
I need to calculate the Petrosian radius for each source as well. I can draw a histogram of the Petrosian radii for all the sources detected within the PSF of the instrument and use only those sources that have a radius larger than a certain value (say the FWHM or PSF of a bright Point source in the field). I think the histogram will be skewed towards larger radii as there are a large number of SF regions in the image and then set the size, like say 'X' pixels. And then I could do the photometry on the identified SF regions.
How do I find the Petrosian radius and proceed with using the SExtractor? Could someone tell me the inputs for this? Here are the default parameters.
