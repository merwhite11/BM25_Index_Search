Why is Io's volcanism chemically so different from Earth's?

Volcanic gases on Earth are mainly water, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, but on Io there is a notable absence of water and carbon dioxide in volcanic gases, since sulfur dioxide is the dominant gas expelled by volcanoes in this satelite, why does this happen? It seems strange to me that water is not an important volcanic gas on Io when it's quite common in the composition of the other Jovian satellites.
In addition, the Io's surface is very rich in sulfur, which comes from volcanoes, but other bodies of the solar system that also experienced intense volcanic activity at some time have a surface dominated by basalt, such as Mercury or Mars. So, if Io has had intense volcanic activity for a long time, why doesn't it have a dark gray basalt surface like Mercury but a yellow one because of sulfur?
