Calculate eccentric anomaly using Kepler's equation

I'm developing a C++ computer library with the formulas in the book "Practical Astronomy with your Calculator or Spreadsheet 4th Edition" but I have a problem with the formula 56, "Perturbations in a planet's orbit".
The book talks about using the Kepler's equation to calculate the eccentric anomaly, E. To do it I have implemented this routine:
double TheSun::RoutineR2(double meanAnomaly, double eccentricity)
{
    double E = 0.0;
    double aux = 0.0;
    double delta = 0.0;

    // Epsilon is the required accuracy (= 10^-6 radians).
    double epsilon = 0.000001;

    // 1. First guest, E = E0 = M.
    E = aux = meanAnomaly;
    
    do
    {
        // 2. Find the value of delta = E - esin(E) - M;
        delta = aux - eccentricity * std::sin(aux) - meanAnomaly;

        // 3. If delta gets enough accuracy, end here.
        if (std::abs(delta) <= epsilon)
            break;

        // 4. Find E growth.
        double growth = delta / (1 - eccentricity * std::cos(aux));

        // 5. Take the new value.
        aux = aux - growth;

    } while (true);

    return aux;
}

When I try to find the eccentric anomaly, E, for planet Jupiter on 22 November 2003, I get that E is equal to 8.7201007604944394 but, in the book, the value for E is 2.436915 radians.
The input value for RoutineR2 are:
meanAnomaly = 8.6884193953285500
eccentricity = 0.048906999999999999

The values above are the same than the book uses.
I have calculated the mean anomaly and I get the same value than the book. The eccentricity is the eccentricity of the orbit of Jupiter. I take it from the Table 8 in the book. This table has the values of Elements of the planetary orbits at epoch 2010.0.
Is the book wrong? Am I wrong?
Maybe my implementation of Kepler's equation is wrong or I'm not using the right value for eccentricity.
