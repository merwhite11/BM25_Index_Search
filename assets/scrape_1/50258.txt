Are heavy elements equally distributed throughout the Solar System?

I want to know if heavy elements are distributed roughly evenly throughout the Solar System or if they are (excluding the Sun) concentrated mostly in a particular area, such as the inner part. Would heavy elements be rarer in the Kuiper Belt and outer planets for instance?
