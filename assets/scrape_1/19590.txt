Planets not visible

I have recently purchased an Orion AstroView 90mm Equatorial Refractor telescope, also this is my first time having a telescope. The telescope came with a 25mm and a 10mm eyepiece, I also bought a Celestron OMNI 2x Barlow lens.
Just the other night I was looking through my telescope at the moon, and with all my eyepieces and Barlow lens the image of the moon comes out really clearly. But when I go to look at mars or venus (also in the western sky) the image of the two planets come out really blurry. The image of the planets through my telescope come out as a circle with a bunch of horizontal lines through the circle also a couple of black dots on the outer edge of the circle. 
I know that these two circles that I was looking at were planets, and I know that they were not stars. I am really confused about the whole thing of me being able to see the moon clearly but not see any of the planets clearly.
Can someone please help me figure this out. I have also tried looking through the telescope without the star diagonal, to be honest I have tried all possibilities with my lenses and all of my parts.
