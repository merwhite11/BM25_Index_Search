Dealing with damp and dew whilst stargazing at night or in the early morning

Sometimes when using my telescope late at night or early in the morning, especially in the more humid of seasons, I notice i sometimes get dew buildup on the lenses. 
How can I minimize damp buildup whilst using my telescope?
Simply dabbing away the liquid with a dry cloth doesn't seem to do the trick as I am still left with some water tracks and residue that I just can't soak up, this then means that all of the light is refracted providing a very fuzzy and blurry image. 
What preventative measures can i take to stop damp build up in the first place?
