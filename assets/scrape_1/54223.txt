Is there a link between a star's metallicity and the availability of chemical elements in its system?

Considering aspects of interstellar trade for worldbuilding purposes, I'm researching what resources might be available in each star system.
The premise is that if one star system has an abundance of a particular resource that is rare, hard to obtain or unavailable at all in other star systems but is in high demand for whatever reason, this resource would be this star system's primary export commodity.
I'm abstaining from inventing fictional resources and materials and keeping to the real-world chemistry.
Gathering data, I have noticed that stars have varying metallicities. This has raised the question posed in the title.
I consider available only the elements on planets, moons, asteroids and comets and as particles floating in interplanetary space.
