"How the Universe Works": is it scientifically accurate?

The documentary/mini-series How the Universe Works is based on scientific evidence and according to what is known nowadays, or sheer bunk?
Throughout the series, are there any particular topics which are still disputed among the scientific community and that were portrayed in a different light than they should've had been?

I've only watched a few episodes but they always talk in a way that gives you the feeling everything is well-established and accepted but that might not be the case. I figured that an astronomer that watched the series would have remember if this happened or not.
I understand the subjects were researched and there is footage of known scientists in the episodes, but that doesn't mean everyone agrees with them. (By everyone I mean the most part of scientists working on those subjects, and not literally every single one of them.)
To give you an example, on the second episode they state that there are massive black holes at the center of galaxies. From my perspective (i.e. of someone which is not an astronomer) if they say so it's because it's probably true. However, in the real world maybe this is a highly disputed theory and a lot of astronomers disagree with this stance, and they're note telling the audience about it. Why would they do that? I don't know. I don't know if they did, I'm just asking if someone knows whether it happened, or if anyone saw something in the series with which they disagree.
