Metal distribution in our solar system

The sun dominates in our solar system.
I wonder whether in every aspect the sun plays the most important role in our system.
For example, all kinds of metals are mainly located in the sun instead of the rest combined together in our system? 
Is there any complementary relation between the sun and its children (all the planets, asteroids etc..)?  
I mean: for one kind of metal, if the sun has more, her children should have less.
According to Abundance in the Sun of the elements, at least Li and Tb abundance of the sun are very low ($\approx1e-8$). Furthermore, these abundances are from the solar atmosphere which is near the surface of the sun.
