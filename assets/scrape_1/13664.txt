What Are Some Good Southern Hemisphere 7x50 Binocular Targets?

I've been interested in astronomy for a while but only recently purchased my first set of binoculars (7x50). I've been learning various constellations as well as spotting some other objects with the help of my planisphere. I live in the suburbs of a big Australian city, but far enough out that the light pollution isn't too bad.
I've already been looking at objects like the Orion Nebula and Pleiades, but hoped some experts might be able to give me a list of objects that would be worth hunting down with my binoculars. Ideally some that would be visible now (it's Summer here), but some for other times of the year would also be fine.
