What is the apparent size of Earth from the Sun?

Heatwaves have been in the news in recent years. I found it amazing to consider that the energy from the Sun is enough to kill you, when only a tiny fraction of its radiation reaches Earth.
Then I wondered, what fraction of the Sun's energy reaches Earth, exactly? I think the way to approach this is to answer: What fraction of the Sun's sky does the Earth take up?
Can anyone tell me what the answer is? How do you calculate it? Is this the right way to approach the question?
