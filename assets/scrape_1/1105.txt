Is it possible to measure galactic red shift using consumer telescope equipment?

I was wondering if it would be possible to measure red shift from distant galaxies using consumer grade telescope equipment and spectroscopy filters. (like this one)
I imagine it would require a tracking mount, and enough aperture to gather data on distant faint objects, but I wonder if it would require more sensitive equipment then a consumer grade tools available for under 5-6 thousand. 
A long term goal would be to replicate Hubble's work, and directly measure the expansion rate of the universe from backyard equipment.
