What is the variation in the time it takes a black hole to evaporate from Hawking radiation?

I often see figures of how long it would take a black hole of a given mass to evaporate away due to Hawking Radiation.  The wiki page itself mentions that a black hole of about $10^{11}$ kg takes about 2.667 billion years to evaporate.  As I understand it, Hawking radiation is a statistical process, so there will be a random factor in this evaporation time.  So what is the standard deviation of black hole evaporation times, at least as an order of magnitude estimate?  Is it always very tiny, does it have a similar timescale to the expected life time, or what? In particular, would that $10^{11}$ kg black hole have any meaningful chance of surviving ~13 billion years, or is it going to be gone long before then with near absolute certainty? We may assume, as I assume those other calculations do, that the spacetime is flat at infinity and that the black hole is the only thing in the universe (so no microwave background radiation to feed the black hole, etc.).
