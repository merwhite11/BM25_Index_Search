What is the connection between moons, rings, and gaps?

I was watching this video and they said that the rock probably has a moon. Is the reason they assume it has a moon is because there is a gap between the rings created by the moon's orbit around the rock? Or the rings created by the moon breaking down in its orbit and leaving debris behind in its orbit?
