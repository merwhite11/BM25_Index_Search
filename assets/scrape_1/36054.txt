Why doesn’t the Sun fill the sky on Mercury?

I’ve seen a lot of photos showing Mercury in front of the Sun when it passes by and you can see just how tiny it is in comparison.
Here’s a great example:

So I’d expect if I was travelling towards Mercury in that photo that as the planet got bigger in my view so would the Sun and eventually I wouldn’t be able to see the edges of the sun because it’s so big at this distance... makes sense that an object gets bigger the closer you get to it!
However what confuses me is that if you were on the surface of Mercury... this is the view you’d get where it’s about a 6 times larger than when viewed from Earth.

So how is this so small when it’s taking the whole view up when we’re viewing it further away from mercury in the first photo? But we’re closer in the second photo but now the sun is smaller... How is the first photo possible (it’s an actual photo taken by NASA) why isn’t it taking up the whole sky in the second photo when you’re actually on the planet?
