Mathematical condition of Stationary Planet

In an old astronomy book I find the following definitions:
$\vec r_1$ Position vector of Earth (heliocentric)
$\vec r_2$ Position vector of a Planet (heliocentric)
$\vec v_1$ Velocity vector of Earth (heliocentric)
$\vec v_2$ Velocity vector of the Planet (heliocentric)
$\vec n_1$ Angular velocity vector of Earth (heliocentric)
Then, the geocentric position vector of the planet, and its geocentric velocity vector are:
$$\vec r=\vec r_2- \vec r_1$$
$$\vec v=\vec v_2- \vec v_1$$
A planet is said to be stationary when its geocentric longitude does not vary.
So far, no problem, but now it says:
The projection on the ecliptic of the relative areal velocity is then zero and, therefore:
($\times$ is the cross product and $\cdot$ is the dot product)
$$\boldsymbol{\vec n_1 \cdot (\vec r \times \vec v)=0}$$
It is the sentence in bold and the subsequent mathematical expression that I do not understand. Why?
Thank you and best regards.
