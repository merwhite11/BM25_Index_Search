What's the correct distance to Betelgeuse?

Reading [1], [2] and this smartphone app[3], I'm getting different answers to the question.
The smartphone app is stating 427ly. [1] states approx. 700 ly,  and [2] states approx. 724ly.
Even if I take [1] as the correct value, why does [2] state 724ly and the app stating 427ly?
Thanks
