Virial theorem, contraction, and stars getting hotter

So, for a homogeneous sphere made of ideal gas the virial theorem applies:
$$E_{int}=-\frac{1}{2}E_{grav}$$
I have read that this implies that a star must get hotter when it contracts.
I don't quite understand why this is the case. The internal energy is proportional to T. During contraction, $E_{grav}$ increases, but since there is a minus sign, this means that the internal energy decreases - so how do we get the increasing temperature?
Sorry if this is a very obvious question, I appreciate any help.
