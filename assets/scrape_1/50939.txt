How a sunspot number is calculated by an individual observer?
I would like to learn how to calculate the daily number of sunspots and where to get daily input images of the Sun.
I have read tens of web links and none mentioned or described any algorithm to work for the calculation of the sunspot number.

What is the number of sunspots in this paper plate drawing?

visited NOAA, NASA, ESA, SILSO

and still no hint and how numbering, encoding is assigned to individual sunspots in the paper plate drawing  (as above).
