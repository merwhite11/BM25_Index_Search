Is our Milky Way galaxy (and its neighbors?) moving through the universe at 370 km/s (~828,000 mph) or 370 miles/sec (~1,332,000 mph)?

I swear that exactly half of the many, many sites I found say that our Galaxy and its immediate neighbors are moving towards the Leo Constellation (I believe) and, ultimately, supposedly, the 'Great Attractor' at about 1.3 million mph or about 370 mps) and the other half claim it is moving at about 830,000 mph (about 370 kps).
Does anybody have a definitive answer?
