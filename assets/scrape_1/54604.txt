Bica 5 open cluster

Someone referred to the open cluster Bica 5. Is that to do with E Bica? How would I get information about this cluster? I do not have many options. I have been just trying general searches using Google, and on Arxiv - and various forums. Any help would be appreciated.
Eduardo Bica - Tracing the Galactic spiral structure with embedded clusters. 2015. In that paper there is a table of about 20 clusters, but it is not clear whether any of these is Bica-5.
I am trying to help out someone who is studying in a war zone. Hence the odd nature of the question. I am trying to get some more information - but was hoping that this was a question to which the answer was obvious, if you had the right background.
