What is the difference between inclination and obliquity?

I'm trying to understand the differences between obliquity and inclination when it comes to a system of a planet orbiting a star.
From what I understand, obliquity is the angle between the orbital plane of the planet and its axis of rotation. However, when I am reading about inclination - it seems that it is very similar.
Can someone please clarify the difference between the two?
