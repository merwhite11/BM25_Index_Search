Nightsky observation : a light/star suddenly disappeared, why?

For starter, I'm a beginner/noob  in astronomy so it might be an obvious answer but I keep asking it to myself
I was watching the sky in the night looking for shooting stars, there was plenty of them, but at the end of my observation, I saw a star that was idle in the sky suddenly disappear in a small flash.
At first, I was like "Ok, I might just saw a star that just died" but that's not how lightspeed works, that's a slow process and I shouldn't have seen it like that in a flash of light, because it takes much more longer.
Do someone have any idea of what it could be ?
