The reason behind Big Bang

It always amuse us to research about things around us and we always start our research with a question that - what must be the reason for happening of that phenomenon?
As we know that the formation of universe is being postulated with theory of Big Bang. 
But now, I want to ask that what was the reason for Big Bang. I mean why it happened, what must be the circumstances or what made it happened?
