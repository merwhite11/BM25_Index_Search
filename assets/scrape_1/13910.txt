How much of a difference do good lenses make?

I recently purchased a Celestron PowerSeeker 114EQ and with it I got three lenses (which I assume are low quality), a 4mm, a 20mm and a 3 x Barlow.

I can get pretty decent views of the moon but a very blurry, small view of Jupiter with the 4mm and Barlow.  I can see the color of the storm rings for example, but barely.  I've not had a chance to have a go at Saturn yet.  A view similar to this...

I've been reading up on this and was looking at purchasing a 4-8mm Pl√∂ssl lens but I'm not sure if the lens is my weak spot or some other aspect of the telescope.
Another thing to note is that I've been using it in a pretty bright street, looking up very close to street lights.  I've not had a chance to take out somewhere with less light pollution.
So what I'm asking is, how much difference would a lens upgrade make, specifically to my image quality?
