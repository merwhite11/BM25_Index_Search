Is there a reason Tethys and Dione are the only moons known to have trojans?

Trojans have been found at the L4 and L5 points of most planets. However Tethys and Dione, both moons of Saturn, are the only known moons in the Solar System to have trojans of their own.
Is this just a coincidence? Or is there something unique separating Tethys and Dione from the rest of the moons in the Solar System?
