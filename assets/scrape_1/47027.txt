How long is a mean Jovian tropical year in Jovian solar days?

Many sources say that Jupiter's year lasts 10,475.8 Jovian days. When I calculated to see if that's correct With the data NASA had published, I found out it's the measurement of a Jovian sidereal year. How many Jovian solar days are there in one mean Jovian tropical year EXACTLY?
