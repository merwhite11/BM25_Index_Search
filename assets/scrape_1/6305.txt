Is it possible that a ultra-large portion of the space we live in is already inside a black hole? How could we refute this?

Trying to wrap my head around some concepts involving the very large gravitational fields of black holes, and what the gravitational gradients look like on a cosmic scale.
I'm familiar with the Great Attractor, and wondered if it were possible if the Milky Way and it's neighbors are already "doomed" to fall into whatever the anomaly is.

Per recommendation, I've moved the second half of my question to a new Question here: Assuming a sufficient amount of mass above the density threshold, does the actual concentration of the mass matter in creating a black hole?

Extrapolating further, I've heard that the actual density of a black hole (within the volume of the event horizon) is pretty low, on the order of thin atmosphere - does that mean that any sufficiently large volume of mass over that density is also a black hole? Or does the actual concentration within the event horizon matter?
