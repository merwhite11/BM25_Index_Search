How did the Ancients understand the ecliptic using the Ptolemaic system

I studied the Farnese Atlas and I wonder how did the Ancients discover the ecliptic, the equator, etc. with the Ptolemaic system namely without knowing that the Earth rotates on itself, especially for the Ecleptic. 
I ask the question because if in their model the Earth does not rotate, so how do they explain the two revolutions of the sun around the earth:

The first one being the daily cycle (sunrise and sunset)
The second one being the tropical year

With a model where the Earth does not rotate, I do not understand how they found out that the Sun make a revolution of a one year around the Earth (whence the ecliptic) with a second daily revolution. How could they conjugate these two Sun's cycles?
