How do planets retain momentum?

I'm watching this YouTube video, and in it, the lecturer explains a model of planetary orbit. At 1:55 he shows how a marble will naturally orbit the center object, and he briefly claims that planets will not lose energy like the marble does. But I cant see how that is the case. Surely there must be meteors, asteroids, comets, including general space debris, that will over the course of millennia, diminish this energy/momentum.
How then, can planets retain their energy, when there are almost only forces that would slow it down? Slowly increasing the energy wouldn't help either, as it would offset the balance. How can there be stability, especially over the course of millions of years?
