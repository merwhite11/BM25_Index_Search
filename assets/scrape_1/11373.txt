What would Earthlike planets bigger than Earth with <10 m/s^2 gravity and complex life be like?

Large is bigger than Earth. Assuming that such planets exist (though I guess if such planets don't exist that would explain much of the Fermi paradox).
Maybe some amount of iron is needed though, to make a magnetic field.
I guess you could also have a planet like that with very good climate and gravity for Earthlings but toxic air and a lot more carbon or ammonia or methane or hydrogen or formaldehyde or acetone or alcohol or hydrocarbons than here. It wouldn't be Earthlike but it'd look like a lush land where the rocks are all graphite or diamond and the sky is brown or something. That planet could be like the Garden of Eden for a sentient that's mostly acetone and would get drunk from an ounce of H2O (or whatever chemicals are appropriate).
