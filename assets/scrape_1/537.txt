Why does the Earth have a tilt of ~23°?


Is there a reason that the Earth has the tilt that it does (~23°)?  
How do we know which way is supposed to be 0°? 
Does this tilt have major consequences on the planet? 
Has it changed and will it change in the future? (If so, would there be any consequences?)
