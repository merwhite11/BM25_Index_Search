Orbital parameters of the Sun

What are the orbital parameters of the Sun such as orbit velocity etc in it's orbit around the Solar System's center of mass? Consider the Sun pointlike or alternatively when talkin about the Sun's movement I mean it's center of mass.
Do not tell me that the Sun is stationary because the planets' masses can be neglected. I do no want such oversimplifications.
