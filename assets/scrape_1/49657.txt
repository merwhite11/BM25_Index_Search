Pulsar rotation linear velocity

I recently came upon millisecond pulsars. I knew of pulsars, I had never guessed though that they can spin so fast.
I believe I had read about a pulsar rotating at about 10-15Hz.
But I just read about J1748-2446ad, which rotates at the astonishing 716Hz.
Brief research and I find its radius is about 16km, making its rotation circumference:
$c = 2πr ≈ 100.5km$
Given that the pulsar rotates at 716Hz, its linear velocity at the surface should be:
$v = 716c/s ≈ 71900km/s$
Assuming these calculations are nearly correct, could it be that any point on the rotation circumference moves at about 24% of the speed of light? Can this be possible?
Thanks for any answers that will satisfy my curiosity.
