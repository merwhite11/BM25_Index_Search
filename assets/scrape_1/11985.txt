Realistic space environments

You've seen it in all kinds of science fiction, be it books, games, movies, and such. Space is depicted all sorts of ways, with asteroids far too close together, nebula thick enough to hide in and much more. Yet for a writer that want's to describe space accurately, this is a problem. 
So I need stellar features and reasons why they would form/exist
Here's a rough list of what I'm talking about:

Thick asteroid style fields, averaging around 100 meters apart
Nebula regions that are actually thick enough to obscure light, like clouds
Dust cloud regions thick enough to obscure light
Any other kind of cloud of material that's similar to the two above
Naturally occurring fields of explosive gas or a physical material that does the same
Radiation levels high enough to eat through ship plating
Naturally occurring anomalies of any sort, such as black holes, rogue planets and stars

An example would be a protoplanetary disc. Could this allow for material in close proximity so you have rocks in orbit that are close together? What about clouds of material? Would a forming star would have a thick cloud of material around it?
Anything naturally occurring or even unnaturally occurring is fine, so long as space magic or whatever isn't involved.
If I missed anything you can think of, please elaborate. This topic has been difficult for me to find information on.
Extra question: Could a cloud or clouds of opaque gas exist, even for a short time in space? With or without other material present works.
