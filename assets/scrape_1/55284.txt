How can Kerr black holes have a 'speed limit' to how fast they can spin?

Obviously, the speed of light is a presumed limit, at least for 'physical' objects moving 'within' ('through'?) spacetime, but...
In recent news some scientists believe they have figured out the approximate angular velocity of our own supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, and stated that it is about 0.9 on a scale from 0 to 1....
However, they said that a black hole spinning at a speed of 1 on the scale is not necessarily rotating at the speed of light, let alone faster, because they believe there is an intrinsic limit to how fast a black hole of a particular size (mass? or volume?) can actually spin...
How can there be an absolute upper limit to a black hole's spin?
Also, how could it be limited (or even slowed) by interactions with the outside universe?  The surface(s) of a black hole are not entirely 'physical' like normal objects, as these same articles make clear.... So how can a black hole become tidally locked to an outside object or exchange angular momentum with it?
