Why was the Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST Camera tested with a broccoli and a pinhole?

The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory video Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST Camera (caution! annoyingly loud music, lower volume before playing) shows a Romanesco broccoli (which I'd assumed was a 3D printed mathematical surface of that name until I checked and found out that this is the name of an actual vegetable i.e. Brassica oleracea) as the object of a pinhole camera projecting its image on to the astoundingly large CCD array.
There are likely several advantages to using the pinhole rather than a well-corrected projection lens, is it possible to say what they are?
Is it also possible to elaborate on the choice of object for the camera?

What is the LSST now? Where does LSST end and Vera C. Rubin Observatory begin?
