Contradictory errors in python package VESPA

VESPA is a python package that can calculate the False Positive Probability for Exoplanets. Here is the link to the repository

https://pypi.org/project/VESPA/
https://github.com/timothydmorton/VESPA

I had installed it successfully but while importing the package I got an error in NumPy package. I found out that it was due to the older version of NumPy. So I updated it to the latest (1.22.1).
But in that case I got an issue that the another package called Numba wants NumPy of version 1.21 or less.
*I tried for NumPy 1.21 as well but again the same problem.
Here I'm attaching the link to the  pdf that contains the traceback.
