How would "dark matter", subject only to gravity, behave?

If we were to hypothesise that the Universe contained a significant mass of "dark matter" particles subject only to gravity, presumably general relativity would give us a good idea of how they would behave.
For example, what would happen in a region where they were the only mass?
