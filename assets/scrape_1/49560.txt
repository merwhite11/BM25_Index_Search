Is the dark matter/baryonic matter ratio the same in galaxies with supermassive black holes?

My hypothesis is that if the ratio of dark matter/matter in galaxies with supermassive(weighing billions of suns) black holes are higher the black hole itself would be made of a large portion of dark matter.
That might have interesting implications.
Are there any data supporting this or that the composition of galaxies with supermassive black holes are different.
