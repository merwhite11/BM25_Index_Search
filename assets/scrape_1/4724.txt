How many new galaxies enter the observable universe each day/year/decade?

Each day light has more time to reach our eyes from distant galaxies. In one day, light travels 2.59Ã—10^10 km. 
So our observable universe (assuming my simple math skills apply here and there isn't something about relativity to take into account), expands that much every day in all directions. So at what rate are new galaxies being encompassed by the expanding observable universe?
