How much mass is lost in the red giant phase of a star?

The red giant phase of stars are relatively fast.  How will this impact a star's total mass? Are there significant mass losses taking place when this happens? If so, do we know how much? The sizes of red giants varies a lot so there obviously can't be an exact value, but maybe there is a specific percentage figure - say, 30% mass lost during the red giant phase.
