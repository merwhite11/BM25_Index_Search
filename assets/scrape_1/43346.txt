Universe expansion data validation

I am not an expert, just a enthusiast, so if possible please keep explanation simple.
That said I have start reading about universe expansion and the idea seems to me revolutionary (the image of an infinite bigger universe that inflate).
So I am questioning how researcher validate that specific theory excluding other causes that IMHO would be more intuitive?
For example how they exclude that the expansion is not only a local effect (that's happening on ours patch of observable universe)?
