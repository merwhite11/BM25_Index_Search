What would shadows look like on a planet with two suns?

On planet Tatooine which has two (main-sequence I guess) suns people still have one shadow only. Tatooine's suns seem quite close to each other, so it may actually be the case that the two shadows are so close that it almost looks like a single shadow, or not? And what if the two suns were far from each other on the day sky? I think this wouldn't look like two shadows from two lamps either, instead they would look equally dark (assuming both suns have about the same apparent brightness) as the region where the shadows meet, or would there be any noticeable difference between the darkness of the shadows and the darkness of both shadows upon each other?
What would a human's shadow(s) look like on a planet that has two suns close to each other (like Tatooine), and on a planet whose suns are far from each other on the sky?
