What is the spectral reflection curve of cold white dwarfs and neutron stars?

Suppose that I got a white dwarf and a neutron star and after some trillions of years their temperature are down to just a few Â°K so cold that they don't emit any appreciable black body radiation.
Now, I send to each one, a robot/spaceship with a huge spotlight and shine a white light into them, possibly even making those old balls as illuminated as the Earth is, even if just for some seconds or minutes.
Also, the robots/spaceships takes photos to be presented as human eyes would see on a distance enough to see them roughly the same angular size that a basketball has in my hand when my arm is extended.
So, let's go to the actual questions.
What would be the color of the stars?

Would they act like perfect spherical mirrors reflecting not just the spotlight, but everything else nearby?
Or would they appear white by reflecting all that light diffusely?
Or maybe pitch black because they would absorve all the light and reflect nothing?
Perhaps gray, by partially reflecting and partially absorving the light diffusely equally in all wavelengths?
Or silvery?
Or perhaps, due to Doppler gravitational reddening, golden?
Or, maybe I am missing something funny and they are pink, blue or green?

Bonus:
Could I distinguish them only by looking at the photos without measuring density, gravity, size or radiation, considering that the photos show them with the same angular diameter?
