What kind of telescope would be needed to image a 10m dim object 1 million km away?

There's a 10m diameter object 1 million km away from you, stationary with respect to you. The object is dim: it is at 3K and is not reflecting any light towards you. So you have to pick it out by the way it occludes background stars and galaxies.
What kind, and what size, of telescope would be able to achieve this?
I'm guessing that you would want a large ultraviolet telescope. Picking a UV telescope at random for comparison, GALEX had 25cm^2 effective area and an angular resolution of 6 arc seconds. This resolution would need to be at least 2900 times better to spot the object. So you need a UV telescope with an effective area of at least 25cm^2 * 2900^2 = 21025 m^2, corresponding to a radius of about 82 meters.
Is that about right? Or could you make do with a smaller telescope by increasing the exposure time, decreasing the field of view, or something else?
