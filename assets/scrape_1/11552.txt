How did the moon's orbit become eccentric?

The Moon's orbit is more eccentric, 0.0549, than most planets. I can understand that planets get eccentric by disturbing each other like under the late heavy bombardment. And likewise for multiple moon systems. But shouldn't the debris after the collision with Theia have been circulirized? Is its orbit being changed by the planets, at every opposition with Venus?
