Lightest Neutron Star ever observed?

Fundamentally, my question is, is this a real and confirmed observation?   Or is there a too-high margin of error for now?

A 0.77 solar mass neutron star kind of breaks what I've read is possible.  It's too low a limit.
I have other questions, especially if this is accurate, but in keeping with the one question at a time rule, I just want to know how well-supported this claim is.
