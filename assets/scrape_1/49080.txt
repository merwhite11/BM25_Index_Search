What stars am I seeing in the daytime?

I currently live in the United Kingdom, in an area where the overall elevation is high so while the hills are rolling rather than peaky, they are all well above sea-level. A few weeks ago I was on a height and the sky was crystal clear. It was around 5pm in the afternoon. The moon was almost full and very visible indeed. There were also two 'stars' visible. I didn't have time to dwell on it then but I'm really wondering now what I saw. Stars are also visible here long after sunrise sometimes. In my mind, the obvious candidates are Venus and Sirius A but after many internet searches specifically under those titles and by asking about objects visible in the daytime, it seems that there is little to confirm that they can appear in the daytime (after sunrise). I doubt these stars could be any other candidates though. Could anyone provide specifics?
