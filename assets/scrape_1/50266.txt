Do planets lose energy while rotating?

When a planet rotates/spins, is it true that the planet loses energy? If this is true, then where does this energy lost by the planet go?
My confusion may be in the basic understanding of the mechanism. When I imagine a planet rotating, what I think is either of the two things may happen -

The planet already has energy within the system, which is lost when the planet rotates.
OR
The planet rotates because it receives energy from the outside.

So which one of the above actually happen?
This is what I think may happen. If I am wrong, please correct me.
