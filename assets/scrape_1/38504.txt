Can an average person see stars from the bottom of a well or through cardboard tubes? Definitive answer required!

A debate about seeing stars or planet during the day below this answer to the Aviation SE question At what altitude might a pilot be able to see at least the brightest stars during the day? seems unresolved.
I'm pretty confident that Venus can be seen during the day through a cardboard tube only because I've seen this mentioned so many times.
But what about stars? And what's this about Aristotle and Sir John Herschel?

Here's a reprint of the debate referenced above just in case some get deleted in the future:

Yes, but the thing with the hole is a hoax, that doesn't work. What does work are binoculars.


Tell it to Aristotle and Sir John Herschel (see edit above).


The link does not confirm the ability to see stars from the bottom of a shaft, but rather refutes it.


Since they failed, even with binoculars, one wonders if sky conditions were less than optimal (a cirrus layer that isn't even readily visible would broaden the point of a star enough to make it invisible against the general scatter). Star visibility from the ground in daylight is well documented and repeatable, and doesn't require visual aids, if only the sky is completely clear.
