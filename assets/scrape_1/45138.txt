Does the Barycenter shift/combine when 2 planets line up with the sun?

On August 1st-2nd, Earth & Saturn lined up together in relation to the sun.  Here is a website that discusses it:  https://www.healththoroughfare.com/science/saturn-will-line-up-with-earth-and-the-sun-in-beautiful-celestial-show/34561
While the two planets were in alignment, did the Barycenter between the sun & both planets combine into 1 Barycenter?   Or did both planets retain their usual Barycenters?
