Effective gain when stacking N frame images

I am trying to understand how to derive the effective gain in [electrons / ADU] when stacking N frame images in different (summed, averaged, or medianed) ways. I found the  effective gains for the three kinds of stacking methods on page 20 in IRAF/DAOPHOT user's manual.

The image is the sum of N frames:
effective gain = gain

The image is the average of N frames: effective gain = N * gain

The image is the median of N frames: effective gain = 2.0 * N * gain / 3


To calculate photometry errors, I need to take these effective gains into consideration.
I would appreciate if you explain how to derive these results. Thank you.
