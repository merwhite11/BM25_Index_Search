How much would you weigh if Earth stopped orbiting the Sun?

I have a curious question.
The reason why astronauts are weightless in space is because they are orbiting Earth. If they suddenly stopped orbiting they would fall directly into Earth. Earth is doing the same around the Sun, so it would fall directly into the Sun if the Earth stopped orbiting the Sun.
If the Earth stopped rotating and orbiting, obviously ignoring the adverse effects of doing this and having Earth hold it's current position in it's orbit, how much would a 150 pound person weigh if they stood on suitable position on Earth.
This question is kinda out there, but it's a thought-provoking question for me and hopefully others.
