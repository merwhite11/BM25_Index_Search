What would happen to the Galilean moons and Titan if Jupiter and Saturn disappeared?

The Moon reportedly doesn't "need" the Earth to revolve around the Sun. If the Earth wasn't there, the Moon would continue its current path from a heliocentric reference frame around the Sun. My question is whether that would happen to some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn too. If Jupiter or Saturn weren't there, would Ganymede or Titan continue to freely revolve around the Sun, or what would happen to their orbits?
Thank you.
