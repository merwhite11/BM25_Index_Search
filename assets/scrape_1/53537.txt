Moonsighting on 20/04/2023 in Tumair KSA

The moon has reportedly been observed on the evening of 20/04/2023 in Tumair, Saudi Arabia, marking the end of Ramadan. According to some websites such as this one, this cannot happen. I was wondering how accurate these calculations are, and can we say for sure the moon has not been observed?
