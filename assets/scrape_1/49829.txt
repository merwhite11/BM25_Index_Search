What's mean of the "FITS BLOCK"?

I am studying FITS file, through this: Definition of FITS
They said Fits block is like below(page3).

A sequence of 2880 eight-bit bytes aligned on
2880-byte boundaries in the FITS file, most commonly either
a header block or a data block. Special records are another
infrequently used type of FITS block. This block length was
chosen because it is evenly divisible by the byte and word
lengths of all known computer systems at the time FITS was
developed in 1979.

It is hard to understand this concept because one HDU's data or header has more information than "2880 byte".
For example, one of the header's character exceed 2880, and 1 character is charged 1 byte.
What's the point I miss?
