New evidence against the existence of dark matter?

I've just read and heard about an article which gives new evidence for MOND - Modified Newtonian Dynamics, which is an alternative to dark matter by proposing that our gravitational law should be modified, and with it evidence against the dark matter hypothesis. I was first brought to attention on this by a video by Dr. Becky on Youtube:

And a few other articles on the discovery:

Does anybody know more about this? Isn't this quite significant? Or am I missing something?
