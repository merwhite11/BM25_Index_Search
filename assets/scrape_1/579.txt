Where does the radiation in space come from and can we observe it?

I have recently been reading that space travel is strongly influenced by "space radiation" and how it poses a threat to human space exploration.
Does this radiation originate from stars like our Sun, or is it an omnipresent — let's just call it — "force" in space (such as cosmic noise) that doesn't have any specific source?
Also, can an amateur astronomer visualize this radiation in some way so as to be able to observe it?
