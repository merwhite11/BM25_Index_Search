What data has JWST obtained of the Trappist-1 exoplanets and where is it?

I have been long waiting spectral data regarding the exoplanets around Trappist-1 and their atmospheres, and I was also long awaiting JWST's launch to get to know more about the system. However, now that multiple months have passed and scheduled observations of Trappist-1 have been made, where is the data? So far best I have seen was some Redditor posting an image he claims he made with the raw data a while ago, but other than that I have seen nothing, not from NASA, not on google, not on scientific articles, I am not claiming there is any sort of conspiracy or anything like that, I just want to know if I am missing something here?
