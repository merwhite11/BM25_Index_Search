What caused the “rake marks” in moon photos?

A conspiracy theorist on Facebook claimed photos from the moon show “rake marks” in the lunar soil. You have to zoom in and look very hard, but I do see a faint pattern of light-colored lines going diagonal to the camera. They’re definitely not rake marks and I don’t think they’re anything artificial, but I’m curious what processes could have caused them, if indeed I’m not imagining them. What they look like most to my untrained eye is some sort of interference pattern. Can anyone shed light on this?
