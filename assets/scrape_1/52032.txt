Was Galileo expecting to see so many stars?

Beginner amateur here. I see mentioned many times that Galileo was surprised to see the moons of Jupiter and all that their existence proved, i.e. the Earth not necessarily being the center of everything in the heavens. However I would think that being the ancients saw stars of various magnitudes, they would actually expect there to be stars of 7th magnitude and up, and whomever first used the telescope would not be surprised at all to actually see them. Is there any historical knowledge about this?
