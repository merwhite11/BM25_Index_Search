How to estimate age of asteroid family Erigon

I have one problem:

On picture below we can see Erigone family asteroids in plane semimajor axis - absolute magnitude. Based on V-type as a consequence of Yarkovsky effect, estimate age of this family bearing in mind that members of this family have spectral of C-type. For average value of change of semimajor axis which belongs to this family take $da=5 \times 10^{-4} \text{AU}$ (for object with diameter $D=1 \,\text{km}$ and time $t=1$ million years). Ignore initial size of family.


I really don't know how to solve this problem (I am studying math, not astronomy). Professor won't tell us how to do it, and I tried to find the answer in his textbook and in two more books in my language, but there is no similar problem at all.
Could you point me in the right direction?
