Couldn't the orbits of ETNOs have been altered by a flying-by rogue planet as well?

Regarding the Extreme trans-Neptunian objects or ETNOs, whose orbits some believe are elongated by a far away planet, could their orbits have been elongated by a rogue planet as well? Is it possible that a planet at solar escape velocity performed a path on which it would attract the ETNOs in a similar way, or does the planet need to (still) orbit the Sun to explain the orbits?
