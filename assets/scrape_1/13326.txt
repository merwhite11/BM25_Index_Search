Redshift for gravitational waves?

According to general relativity, would gravitational waves experience the same sort of redshift that electromagnetic waves experience due to the expansion of the universe?
And are there astrophysical processes that would be expected to have a characteristic 'frequency signature' analogous to the lyman or balmer series of hydrogen which would enable a measurement gravitational wave redshift. 
I'm thinking of processes like baryon accoustic oscillations, certain types of supernovae, neutron star mergers, etc.
