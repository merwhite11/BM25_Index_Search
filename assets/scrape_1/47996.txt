Can you distinguish a transit from an eclipse when observing Galilean moons?

If I look at Jupiter through a small telescope (or binoculars) while Io is overlapping Jupiter, is it possible for me to visually distinguish a transit from an occultation?
For example, maybe there's some sort of visual phenomenon that I could observe during the entry (or exit) of the event.
