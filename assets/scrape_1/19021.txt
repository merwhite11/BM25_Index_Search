What would be the difference in distance between earth and moon on supermoon night (14 November 2016)

As we all know the usual distance between earth and moon is 384,400 km.
But i was thinking how much closer it will be on 14 November 2016, as it will be a supermoon, the brightest and biggest moon in 60 years.
