What is the surface feature of the mesas in the Noctis Labyrinthus on Mars?

Caveat-my knowledge of geology is limited.
Is it known what is the surface like on the larger mesas in the Noctis Labyrinthus?  I trust the very smooth looking surface on this mesa is a product of low image resolution and not proof it is perfectly smooth.

This smaller mesa
 
is described as clusters of boulders and sand dunes on its surface. Do the larger mesas have these features?  Something like this,

Here are different surfaces from images taken by the Mars rovers. Is it known if the larger mesas have surfaces like any of these?

No dunes or clusters of large boulders.

Granted this is not entirely flat, but in the foreground it looks to my laymen's eye as surface bedrock with little sand.

Or generally flat rocks broken up and separate, with sand in between the rocks?
