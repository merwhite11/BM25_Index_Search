Keplers laws and this question

A planet (mass m) is orbiting a star
(mass M) at a distance a. The distance of the star from
the centre of gravity of the system is a'
. Show that
$$
MP^2 = a^2(a-a')
$$
So first we can assume that $M >> m$
so now we get keplers third law as $MP^2 = \text{distance to the center mass}$ of the two objects
so if we then solve for the planet-Center of mass distance it equals $(a-a')$
wont that make the final equation $MP^2 = (a-a')^3$
and not $MP^2 = a^2(a-a')$
so what seems to be the problem in my attempt and why cant I get the correct answer.
the question is taken from fundamentals of astronomy 5th edition springer publication exercise 9.2
