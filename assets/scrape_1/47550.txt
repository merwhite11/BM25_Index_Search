What if hypothetically Ton 618 could have been a star

Assuming Ton 618, the largest ultra massive black hole wasn’t the result of feasting on near by matter but was hypothetically once a single star body. How large in terms of size would TON 618 have been if it was a single star? TON 618 is about 11 times larger then the solar system so how much bigger would it have been before collapsing? Again, hypothetically and how long would it have lived for before collapsing into the ultra massive black hole?
I’m making a game, but I would like to get that figure somewhat right for the shock value to the player to read the ungodly size of such a star!
