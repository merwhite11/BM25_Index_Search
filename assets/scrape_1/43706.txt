Details on the telescope(s) on the Chinese Space Station 天和

The ISS has a telescope on board. Does the Chinese Space Station have one on board as well?
I heard about Xuntian aka Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), but not too many details. Would that be the only telescope? What would be the primary scientific goals?
