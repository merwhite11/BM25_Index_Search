What happens if there were only ordinary matter in the universe? Would the universe expand constantly? or will it decelerate?

This question hit me when I was watching 'Cosmos by Neil deGrasse Tyson' explaining how the universe is expanding and how it accelerates because of dark energy and dark matter, then I asked myself what if there were only ordinary matter in the universe?
