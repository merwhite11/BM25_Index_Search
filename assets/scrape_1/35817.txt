Was it a space station?

I just looked at the sky and saw a star, not so bright but moving very fast and in almost a minute it disappeared, as it was so fast.
Timing was in between 9.35-9.45 PM in Nuremberg, Germany.
My location is 49.45, 11.06. 
So was it International Space station?
Anyway, I'm going to verify it after 92 minutes if i am able see it again.
