Planets just look like dots! Beginner telescope, hoping for some advice

I'm very new to astronomy and got myself a cheap, used  700mm 70mm diameter refractor scope and am able to see (what I think are) good images of the moon. However when I try to view planets I see nothing but a very small dot! Pretty sure I was looking at Mars this eve (slight red colour) but with a 10mm lens its still just a dot. I can make out no detail. Same with Jupiter. Should I be able to see detail with the specs I have? Thanks in advance.
