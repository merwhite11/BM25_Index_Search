What would the Sun be like if nuclear reactions could not proceed via quantum tunneling?

Without quantum tunneling our Sun wouldn't be hot or massive enough to produce the energy it does at the moment. So what would have been the temperature or mass of our Sun without quantum tunneling of protons to maintain the same energy we receive from our Sun?
