A good place to start?

I am a high school student (going into 11th grade next year), who will be taking an introduction to astronomy and astrophysics as part of my core curriculum. As such, I would like to get a head start now, but I am not sure where to start.  Are there any specific learning resources that are recommended? Books, videos, documentaries?
