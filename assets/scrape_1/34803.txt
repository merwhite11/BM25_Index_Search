how to plot sky map like www.nakedeyeplanet.com with dates tags with planetary motion path

I am curious how to plot planetary motion star chart with date tags like on www.nakedeyeplanets.com by Martin J. Powell. 
Is there any way to generate images similar like that. What software should be used MATLAB or what. 
Also should have following features:
 - constellation boundaries 
 - non-overlapping naming of star,constellation
 - different color for planet path for each year
