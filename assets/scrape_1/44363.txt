Why is the globe/compass symbol used more often than the globus cruciger for Earth?

Why is that symbol  used more often (or almost always) when portraying e.g. Earth mass or Earth radii than the globus cruciger ♁ ? From my point of view the globus cruciger fits much better as symbol for Earth because Venus has an upside down globus cruciger, Mercury has the same as Venus with an additional hemisphere, and Mars has an oblique arrow instead of a cross. I don't like the use of the other symbol because when small enough, it can easily be confused with the Sun symbol ☉. Why is it used despite the globus cruciger symbol fitting more?
