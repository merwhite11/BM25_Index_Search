Do asteroids originally come from debris of star remnants?

As we know, asteroids can be found in the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud, but surely the Sun only captures them, not produces them. I know that supernovae may produce heavy elements such as oxygen, silicon and iron, which is the common composition of asteroids, so is it true that asteroids are come from star remnants?
