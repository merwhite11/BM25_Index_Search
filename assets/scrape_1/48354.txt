Is a mirror cell only necessary for collimation?

I'm building a truss Newtonian, and I'm planning on achieving collimation using turnbuckle-style trusses, as demonstrated in this thread. If I'm collimating this way, is there any reason to support the mirror on a mirror cell assembly instead of just rigidly fixing it to the bottom of the tube - i.e does the cell serve any purpose beyond being a way to angle the mirror? Obviously, it's a lot easier (and cheaper) to just mount the mirror directly to the tube; not to mention that it eliminates the sagging patterns that cell designs tend to suffer from, allowing the mirror to be thinner and lighter. Is there another purpose that the cell serves that I am missing - like, say, "protecting the mirror from whatever" - or can I safely discard it?
