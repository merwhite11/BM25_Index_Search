Retrograde and Crescent Phases Visibility on Mars

So I saw this question online

If you lived on Mars, which planets would describe retrograde loops? Which would never be visible as crescent phases?

And on a few QA website I searched, they gived totally different answers,
from Jiskha, it said:

Retrograde motion for outer (Jupiter and beyond); crescent phases for inner (Earth, Venus and Mercury).

On Quizlet, it said:

If you lived on Mars and observed the solar system from there, All other planets would describe retrograde loops, Mercury, Venus, and Earth would always be seen near the sun, and Jupiter and Saturn would never be visible as crescent phases.

And lastly, on Brainly,

If you lived on Mars and observed the solar system from there, would describe retrograde loops, would always be seen near the sun, and would never be visible as crescent phases. (We are limiting responses to the five planets you could see with the naked eye from Mars, which are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn.) Hint: From Earth, all the other planets show retrograde motion; Mercury and Venus are always near the sun; and Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are never visible as crescents.

So which one is correct, and why? Also, how do crescents related to the visibility to other stars?
