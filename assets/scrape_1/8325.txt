What to look for in a tripod for binoculars?

I have been looking at large astronomy binoculars in the 25x100 and 20x80 range. Clearly, these monsters cannot be held steady by hand, or even be held at all for any reasonable length of time using one's arms.
Somewhat related question What should I look for in an astronomy tripod? isn't helpful as a telescope tripod needs to hold a much bigger weight, so it stands to reason that one would get away with something lighter and cheaper for big binoculars.
What's recommended, tripod-wise? Any related pro tips from the binocular crowd?
