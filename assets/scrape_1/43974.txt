Seeming conflict between most distant objects and age of universe (both estimated)

There was a recent article on bbc.com for laypeople like me titled "The mystery of how big our Universe really is", which prompted me to post the following question in their comments section of Facebook, which so far has received no answer, so I am reposting it here in the hope of a better result:
"I have a simple question, which probably has an equally simple answer: if "the furthest visible regions of the Universe are estimated to be around 46 billion light years away" but at the same time "the Universe burst into existence an estimated 13.8 billion years ago", wouldn't the photons (or whatever) that we observe coming from those distant objects have had to have begun their travel towards us long before the universe existed?"
