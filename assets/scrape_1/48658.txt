Why is it called "The LOFAR 'superterp'"? What is a terp, and what's so super about this one?

Wikipedia's Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) includes the image below with the caption:

The LOFAR core ("superterp") near Exloo, Netherlands. The bridges give an idea of the scale.

Question: Why is it called "The LOFAR 'superterp'"? What is a terp, and what's so super about this one?
B. W. Stappers et al. (2011) Observing pulsars and fast transients with LOFAR may offer clues:

A schematic diagram of some of the LOFAR stations in the inner core
of LOFAR − the “Superterp” as it is known − is shown in Figure 1.



Fig. 1. Three successive zoom-outs showing the stations in the LOFAR core. The different scales of the hierarchically organised
HBA elements are highlighted and their respective beam sizes are shown. The large circular area marks the edge of the Superterp,
which contains the inner-most 6 stations (i.e. 12 HBA sub-stations: where there are 2 sub-stations, each of 24 tiles, in each HBA
core station); other core stations can be seen highlighted beyond the Superterp in the third panel. Left: a single HBA tile and
associated beam. Middle: A single HBA sub-station with three simultaneous station beams. Right: The 6 stations of the Superterp
plus 3 core stations in the background are highlighted. Four independent beams formed from the coherent combination of all 24
core HBA stations, most of which are outside this photo, are shown. For the LBA stations, a similar scheme applies except that
each LBA dipole can effectively see the whole sky. Fields of the relatively sparsely distributed LBA antennas are visible in between
the highlighted HBA stations in all three panels.
