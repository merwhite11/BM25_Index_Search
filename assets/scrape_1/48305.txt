How to choose the right Barlow lens?

I have a OneSky AWB 130 (130 mm aperture) Newtonian telescope w/ 650 mm aperture.
I previously asked a question on another account on what lens to get next--@AaronF suggested that I get the Orion Tri-Mag. However, I've stretched my budget, and can afford an eyepiece that's around $100.
The Orion X-Cel 3x Barlow is an example of something in my price range and has good reviews. I understand that seeing conditions must be very good for a 3.3x magnification to work; additionally, according to the comment mentioned above the Orion Tri-Mag has a 2x magnification, which can work better on nights with poorer seeing condition.
This is the current extent of my research, what other factors should I consider?
