Do all total solar eclipses have the ring of fire when observed from ground?

I was recording the phenomenon and then I soon realised that the ring of fire don't dissappear, is it because of the apparent size of the moon and sun as well as the relative distance so that every eclipses I see would alway have the ring of fire on it? Also I ruled out lensing because the moon is not massive enough right?
