Moon path diagram for a location

There are a lot of sun path diagrams online (i.e. https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/seattle-washington.html), but I'm struggle to find a moon path diagram. Is that called something different?
I'm trying to determine if the full moon rise is visible from my window at all, and if so when to watch out for one.
