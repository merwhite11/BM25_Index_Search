Will Lunar Months be the same length Millions of Years in the Future?

If I remember correctly, the amount of time it takes for the moon to rotate around Earth is getting longer over time. Is this true, and if so or the opposite is true and a lunar month is getting shorter, is there a way to estimate how long a lunar month will be in the far future?
Doing a worldbuilding project that takes place 53 million years in the future, and trying to figure out how many months they'd put in a year.
Edit: Specifically trying to figure out the length of the synodic month, not the sidereal month.
