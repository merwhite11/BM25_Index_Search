Scientific possibility of stationary moons for a writer of fiction

I tried to do some research to find an answer for this question before posting this but didn't find anything that I could sink my teeth into.
I was wondering:

if it would be possible for a planet to have a stationary orbit Moon, so only one side of the planet would see the moon ever
what that would do to the oceans and tides of the continent that is on the opposite side of the planet.

Conversely how would oceans and tides be different without the moon?
For my question here I'd like to ask about only the planetary science aspects. For the speculative and hypothetical aspects I can ask a separate question in Worldbuilding SE.
