Why did the moon have a distinct reddish edge tonight?

In Monterey, California, with a "half-moon" high in the sky at about 9 pm (2017-08-30), the moon had a distinct red outline on the outer edge of the NE quadrant; for awhile I saw it also on the outer edge of the SW quadrant.
I observed this phenomena from two locations, about a mile distant from each other.
I've never seen that before. What would cause it?
I took a picture of it with my camera, but you can't tell anything "out of the ordinary" from the image.
UPDATE
It's a clunky picture (I've been watching My Three Sons lately) - red not visible, fuzzy, and makes it like a full moon, but here it is, at any rate:
