Is there a paper on galaxy mergers in clusters of galaxies?

I'm looking for something to cite about galaxy mergers in clusters of galaxies. 
I need numbers on the frequency of mergers in the outer parts of galaxy clusters vs. the cluster center. In the center number densities are higher but so is the velocity dispersion. 
Are mergers of galaxies more likely to occur in the outskirts or the central region of galaxy cluster?
