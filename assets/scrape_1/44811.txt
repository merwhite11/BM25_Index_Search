How can a black hole have a charge, or be charged?

So-called 'hairless' black holes (no-hair theory, or theorem?) , which is what real black holes are, can be described by just three characteristics: Mass, spin, and charge.
It is easy enough to contemplate size and rotation, but what made astrophysicists or cosmologists believe a black hole might build up a charge?
I know that no black hole with a charge, or much if one, has been found, and the concept gets little mention in the news, but how did the idea first come up?
It is an electric charge we are talking about, right?  Outside of the event horizon, correct?
I am confused....
