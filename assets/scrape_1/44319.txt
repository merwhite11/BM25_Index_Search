What colors do other stars have when seen from space close to them?

The Sun looks yellow from Earth because we see it through the atmosphere; in space the Sun looks rather white. Do A-, B- and O-type stars look blue from both their planet's atmospheres and outer space? Do red dwarfs look reddish even if you look at them from space (I mean close to them, in their own planetary system)?
