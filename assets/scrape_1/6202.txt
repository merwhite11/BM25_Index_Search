How many light years away is Earth from the closest outer edge of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way?

How many light years is Earth away from the closest outer edge of the supermassive black hole in Sagittarius A* at the center of the Milky Way?  I don't mean the distance to the center of the galaxy, but to the point in the black hole's circumference where it is closest to us.
