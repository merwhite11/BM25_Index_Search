Does the Honey moon have a precession problem?

In Steven Colbert's interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson after about 03:16 the following is explained:

But wait, all the moons - all the full moons of the year have names. Some are familliar like the Harvest moonâ€¦ and the Moon in June never gets too high in the sky, so it takes on sort-of an amber sunset color, the whole trip. And so that's called the Honey moon. So the June full moon is the Honey moon.

Is there a problem here though? For any given month won't the full Moon oscillate between low and high above the horizon at midnight on an 18.6 year cycle?
