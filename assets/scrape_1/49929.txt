What is roughly the Lorentz factor between interstellar and inter-galaxycluster space?

Could someone provide a rough estimate for the average Lorentz Factor caused by gravitational time dilation between some point in interstellar space in our vicinity within the Milky Way galaxy and some point in the void in-between galaxy clusters?
