Before the 1761 transit, what was our best estimate of the distance to the Sun?

In 1761, many expeditions were launched to determine the distance to the Sun using parallax during the transit of Venus. Prior to the 1761 transit, what was the best estimate for the Earth-Sun distance?
In antiquity, Aristarchus found that the Earth-Sun distance was 20 times the Earth-Moon distance, which is a very gross underestimate. Were there any better measurements than Aristarchus' measurement in the early 18th century?
