How do we know that the planets of our solar system began their formation at more or less the same time?

A long time ago, when I had to help my children with their homeworks, I often had the vexing question « how do we know ? ». It is true that reading a middle-school science textbook is like reading another Bible. Hardly do we have an explanation: « we think we know, and sometimes we do know, because ... ».
Inspired by the question Which planet came first, in which the OP stated « sources suggest that Jupiter might be the first », and by @ProfRob’s answer in which it can be read « The planets all began their formation at more-or-less the same time in the first few hundred thousand years after the protosolar cloud contracted »

My question is :

Which are the clues that allow the disqualification of any existing alternative scenario (for the timeline(s) of planets' formation)?
Note: I am not asking which theory is the most accepted. I am just asking about the scientific approach(es) used to support one particular theory.
