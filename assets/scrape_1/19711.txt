Did uncertainty principle triggered big bang?

So i want to know why world changed from the empty state ( no materials, energy and ...) from to the it's staring state in the big bang shape?
based of this answer's to this question:
big-bang-thoery-what-triggered-it-and-why
they said:

You may think of the pre-Planck and the Planck epoch as a state of the
  universe, which is dominated by quantum fluctuations. They don't need
  a reason or a cause to occur. They are a consequence of Heisenberg's
  uncertainty principle.

So,Did any law like uncertainty principle caused this to be happened or any somethings? 
Or 
This is one meaningless question?!!!
Thanks a lot.
