Visibility of Apollo 11 module

I wasn't around when man landed on the moon in 1969. When I see the moon, I always wonder, were people able to see the rocket?
Yesterday, I looked at the moon in daylight and wondered again.
My question is: how far were people able to see the rocket after it launched?
