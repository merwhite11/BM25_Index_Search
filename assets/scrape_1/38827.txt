Is most hydrogen in the universe in the form of plasma, atomic neutral hydrogen, ionized hydrogen, or molecular?

I have had trouble finding an answer somewhere....
Some places say most hydrogen is plasma, such as the stuff stars are made of (mostly) and the 'warm-hot intergalactic plasma'.
Other places say neutral atomic hydrogen (H(I) to astronomers), such as the stuff in the interstellar medium, is the most common...
