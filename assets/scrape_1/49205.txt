Two objects that looked like stars?

My husband and I were on the back porch looking at the stars, and two caught my eye when I noticed they were moving away from us in a zigzag pattern we watched until we couldnâ€™t see them anymore. The speed was much faster than a plane and there were no blinking lights on them. Every other plane in the sky was clearly a plane. What could this have been?
