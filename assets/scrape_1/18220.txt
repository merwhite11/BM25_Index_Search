What is at the edge of the galaxy?

The solar system is thought to have a heliopause which can be considered its edge for many purposes:
The heliopause is the theoretical boundary where the Sun's solar wind is stopped by the interstellar medium; where the solar wind's strength is no longer great enough to push back the stellar winds of the surrounding stars. This is the boundary where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance.

Heliopause: the boundary between solar wind and interstellar wind where they are in equilibrium.

Is there a similar phenomenon at the interface between space dominated by the Milky Way and intergalactic space?
