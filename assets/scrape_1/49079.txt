Comet Bernardinelli-Bernstein; could it be a "planet-killer" and what could prevent it from getting close to us?

The huge "mega" comet C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelliâ€“Bernstein) 80 miles wide is coming towards Earth from the edge of our Solar System.
It is supposed to only get to the middle of our Solar System . What is preventing it from coming farther? Would it be the gravity of Saturn? Why can other comets come farther than this one?
If it did approach Earth, would the size of this comet make it a potential "planet killer"?
