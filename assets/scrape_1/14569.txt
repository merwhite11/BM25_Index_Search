Do other stars have Oort clouds?

Stars have in the past passed within 1 light year from the Sun, and will do so in the future too. If they have Oort clouds, would there not be interactions between their Oort cloud objects and the planets of the Solar system? For example, the outer edge of the Sun's Oort cloud is approximately 100,000 AU away. So, if another star comes at a distance of 1 light year from the Sun, its Oort cloud should similarly go through the inner solar system. Does this actually happen?
