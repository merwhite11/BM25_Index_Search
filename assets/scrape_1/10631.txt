Why is the moon a fuzzy, white ball?

I currently own a telescope, I'm an amateur astronomer and currently just trying to view the moon. I own the Celestron PowerSeeker 70AZ. 
Link for information on the telescope: http://www.celestron.com/browse-shop/astronomy/telescopes/powerseeker-70az-telescope 
The problem: I can't view the moon! All I see is a big ball of white, and since I'm new I thought I could get some advice for eyepieces:  mine being a regular 20mm eyepiece. I don't use a barlow lens, mine broke.
Thanks! If you want any more specifications, just ask. I'm just looking for help! Thanks!
