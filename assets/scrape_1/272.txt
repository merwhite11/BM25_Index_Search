What is a hypernova and have we observed any?

Inspired by the question "What does it mean for a star to go nova or supernova? Can I safely observe these?", I am curious about what hypernovas are?
Have we observed any occurring, or the at least the after-effects?
Is there an upper limit of how large a stellar explosion can be?
