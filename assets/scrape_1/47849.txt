Could stars like S2 near the galaxy's center have planets in a stable orbit?

I read about one of the stars orbiting Sagittarius A* and according to Wikipedia, it reaches a maximum speed of 0.03c during its orbit. Would this (or any other factor) make it impossible for a planet to have a stable orbit around this star?
