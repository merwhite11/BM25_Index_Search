What is the temperature 55 km beneath the surface of Mars?

What is the temperature 55 km (34.18 miles) beneath the surface of Mars?  The reason I ask is that I want to know if it might be habitable for a possible future colony if they could dig that deep (which might be easier in the lower gravity environment).  If the answer to my previous question is correct, this is the depth that the atmospheric pressure would be equivalent to that on Earth. At what depth on Mars would the atmosphere have equal pressure of that on Earth?
