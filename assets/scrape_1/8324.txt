Limit of hotness!

We know that there is a limit to which an object can be cooled down that is absolute zero, and getting there is also not very easy we may have to wait infinite years to get to that point. But is there any limit to how hot can any object get, or, 

What is the hottest temperature it can reach in the universe, and how can this temperature be maintained? 

I did some research and found that hottest temperature we have ever recorded is by the collision of gold atoms in Large Hadron Collider (LHC), that was 40000000000255.375 K !!! (that is ridiculously hot), but it was for a really short time. How can this extreme temperature be maintained for a significant amount of time?
