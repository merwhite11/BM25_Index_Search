How do we know that objects that appear in duplicate or triplicate, etc. due to strong gravitational lensing aren't actually multiple objects?

If we are looking at faraway objects, there is no parallax view, correct?
So isn't there a chance that an object that appears multiple due to strong foreground gravitational lensing is actually several distinct objects?
