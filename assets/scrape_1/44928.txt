Is it possible for the Sun to lick the Earth with its flames?

The Sun ejects bursts of high-velocity matter, like fiery tongues reaching out. The Sun's magnetic field is able to deliver these bursts at different spots. Sometimes the flames are pulled back in by the field and sometimes they reach out into space without falling back (I'm not sure they fall back but I refer to the circular prominences of Sun stuff).
Can these "flames" reach the Earth?
