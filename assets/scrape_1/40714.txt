Is the age of the Universe really 13.8 billion years?

Ok, I know this has been asked by a lot of people, but my reason for asking this question is a bit different. Please read further.
I was watching a video by Fermilab (Start at 6:30, at 8:30 he mentions how we cannot ever see light emitted from objects > 14bn light years away). In it, the presenter Dr. Don Lincoln talks about the speed of light and how some things are faster than that. Expansion of the Universe can be faster than the speed of light, because galaxies 1 megaparsec away appear to be moving at the rate of 68km/s, galaxies 2 megaparsecs away at 136km/s, and so on. So the velocity of the galaxies doubles every megaparsec. If we do the math, the speed of the galaxies moving away surpasses the speed of light at 14 billion light years away.
14 billion is just 200 million give or take more than the current measurement of the age of the Universe.
My question is, at 14 bn light years away the galaxies are moving faster than the speed of light and we can never see anything beyond that ever. Does this mean that even after say 5 billion years (assuming we still exist), if somebody uses the same technique to measure the age of the Universe, they will end up with the same number that is lesser than 14 billion?
