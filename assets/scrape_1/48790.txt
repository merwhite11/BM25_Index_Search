Do large stars ignite then continue to increase in size, or do they ignite only once they grow larger?

My limited understanding of stellar formation is that a gas cloud condenses enough that various forces (just gravity?) eventually lead to enough pressure to ignite nuclear fusion. However, since stars vary vastly in size it got me thinking: Do young, large stars ignite as smaller stars and then continue to pull material in until they become large, young stars? Or, are they composed of less dense elements or something so that they will only ignite when they are already much larger than stars destined to start and stay small?
