Does the observed Perihelion precession of Mercury still deviate from prediction?

In Wikipedia section about the Perihelion precession of Mercury, we have the follwing table titled "Sources of the precession of perihelion for Mercury":




Amount (arcsec/Julian century)
Cause




532.3035
Gravitational tugs of other solar bodies


0.0286
Oblateness of the Sun (quadrupole moment)


42.9799
Gravitoelectric effects (Schwarzschild-like), a General Relativity effect


−0.0020
Lense–Thirring precession


575.31
Total predicted (*)


574.10±0.65
Observed




Two things caught my eyes which I failed (maybe I was misunderstanding/reading the text) to find explanation for in the text:

It seems that there is still gap between the prediction to the observed precession of at least 0.5 arcsec per century (575.31 - 574.75). Why is that? it it observation issue, if so:
What does the ± account for? is it different values between the centuries or rather observation resolution?

As far as I understand, resolution of 0.5arcs can be easily distinguishable today (say even 0.05 arcsec in 10 years) - so there appear to be a gap between the prediction and observation - a theory gap? Or does it stems from the the uncertainty of accuracy of the Mercury-Sun distance which is to such an extent to cause 0.5arcs sec movement in aphelion in 100 years? or something else?

(*) A more detailed reference to the prediction (from which the figure was taken from Wikipedia) with uncertainties can be found at Park, Ryan S.; et al. (2017). "Precession of Mercury's Perihelion from Ranging to the MESSENGER Spacecraft". The Astronomical Journal. 153 (3): 121.
