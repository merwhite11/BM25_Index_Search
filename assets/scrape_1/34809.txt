Is there any planet or satellite in the solar system in the process of getting tidally locked?

According to
Tidal locking

The effect arises between two bodies when their gravitational
  interaction slows a body's rotation until it becomes tidally locked.
  Over many millions of years, the interaction forces changes to their
  orbits and rotation rates as a result of energy exchange and heat
  dissipation. When one of the bodies reaches a state where there is no
  longer any net change in its rotation rate over the course of a
  complete orbit, it is said to be tidally locked.
