Satellite?? Star?? I am puzzled over what I just saw

I was just outside between 6:10 - 6:12 a.m. this morning (Sep.11/2021) and between this time saw the strangest anomaly in the sky.
It was still completely dark outside, the stars were extremely clear and I was staring into the sky watching them when I noticed what seemed to be a bright star move up & then down (back to its fixed point) and then, a few seconds later it repeated this motion, always going back to the same fixed point in the sky. A few seconds after that, it slowly started traveling in a smooth straight line (in correlation to the other stars that were in the sky). It was moving from south to north. It travelled for approximately a minute before it slowly faded away. I timed itÂ´s brightest point to its darkest (completely gone) from 8-9 seconds.
There were no lights, no sound, & to high of an altitude to be a plane. I thought, maybe a satellite??? but still puzzled over the fact that it was originally fixed in the sky, & then its motion of moving up and down twice before finally travelling in a linear motion - and also strange, the time it took to fade.
Any explanation of what this could be??
