Can an object from a natural process escape earth gravitation?

I'm no expert, but I once studied basic from advanced physics and understand

gravity
action/reaction
escape velocity of 11.2 km/s from the earth surface
escape velocity changing as the object go far away
Karman line for space (100 km)

What I want to know, can a natural object, from a natural process, reach the escape velocity 11.2 km/s and get free of earth gravitation?
I have in mind some volcano explosions. Tornados seem weak. Or also a Comet impact. Question is not limited in time, maybe it was possible millions of years before, when activities and gravity might have been different.
