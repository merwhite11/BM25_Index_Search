Does Tobler's First Law of Geography Apply to Star Composition?

There is a principle in Geography called Tobler's First Law of Geography which states that "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."
Does this principle apply to star composition?  Do stars that are closer together have similar compositions than those that are far apart?  I'm guessing that stars that are formed in the same stellar nursery would have similar compositions.  Have studies been done to compare the compositions and proximity of stars?
