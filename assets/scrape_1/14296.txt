Initially non-flat space-time makes dark matter obsolete$\dots$

After the Big Bang, dark matter clusters and build the seeds for visible matter, that then forms stars, planet, you, me, everybody...
But do we really need dark matter to build cluster first. What if spacetime isn't flat per se on cosmlogical sclaes but rather crumbled or heterogenous, like a 4-dimensional version of folded cloth. We don't need dark matter, if we accept that space time didn't came along at the big bang in a clean way, as mathematical text books on general relavity suggest.
Is it possible to support this idea with astronomical data of galaxy mergers?
