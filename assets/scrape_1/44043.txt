I made a graph trying to show the Sun's movement relative to the Galactic Plane. It doesn't seem to be correct

I made a Desmos Graph following the most voted answer of this question, but I'm not sure if it is correct, because it suggest that the formation of the Sun happened shortly after it would have crossed the galactic plane, but the Sun did not exist before that. Is that possible?
