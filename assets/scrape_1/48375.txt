Draco, Thuban and Northern Ecliptic Pole

I want to try confirm my thoughts on the position of Thuban (Alpha Draconis) in relation to the Northern Ecliptic Pole (NEP). I have been asked to specify how many degrees Thuban is from the NEP today and then 5000 years ago (when it was earths north star).
From everything I have read it seems to me that the ecliptic and NEP is fixed in relation to the stars, as it corresponds to the plane in which the earth travels around the sun. So would I be right in saying in my answers that the distance from the NEP to thuban hasn't changed in 5000 years?
I am aware that the position of the stars change in relation to the Northern celestial pole, but was specifically asked about the ecliptic pole.
Also as mentioned before, I am being asked how many degrees from the NEP thuban is, I am tempted to say zero as the NEP lies in Draco which thuban belongs to, so it can't be that far? Or is there a way of knowing how many degrees it is from the NEP that I am not quite understanding?
Would appreciate anyone leaving their thoughts. Thanks
