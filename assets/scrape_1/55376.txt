Celestial "orbits"

I heard that we're losing our moon, its slipping away from us in such tiny imperceptible steps that we don't notice any significant change even over kiloyears.
The same must apply to planets, inching away from the sun with time.
Now this means, from what I can infer, planetary orbits are actually spirals and not ellipses.
However, Newton's and Einstein's theories still work. My question is, I'm not quite sure as I would like to be, but circular orbits are incompatible with Einstein/Newton gravity theories. A circle is much closer to an ellipse than a spiral and yet the latter is explicable while the former is not.
Quomodo (how)?
