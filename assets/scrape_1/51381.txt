Galaxy plane and Earth's orbit. Connection to seasons?

From my understanding, the Earth (Solar System) crosses a center line of the galactic plane (ecliptic *edit wrong definition, sorry!), while orbiting around the Sun. The Sun also wobbles up and down along this same center plane, while orbiting the galactic center.
Are there any connections of this rhythm to our seasons or climate here on Earth? Are there any definitions or any sort of study, reference, or name, for this concept?
