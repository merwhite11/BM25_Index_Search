Can massive objects pull photons into existence?

When a photon tries to leave a black hole, it is redshifted until the wave length is infinite and the photon disappears(?).
Could this also happen the other way round, that a (non existent) photon with an infinite wave length is blueshifted into existence by a massive object?
If that's true could this explain the background radiation?
I mean that we see radiation within our galaxy that comes from the outside, but does not really exists outside, because on the outside the wave length of this radiation is infinite.
