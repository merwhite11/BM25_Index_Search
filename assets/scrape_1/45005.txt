Is there molecular hydrogen in the Sun's atmosphere? If so, how much, and how was that first determined and measured?

I don't have a license to practice chemistry, but I'll convert Wikipedia's bond dissociation energy of 435.7 kJ/mol to eV by dividing it by $C / N_A$ where $C$ is 1 Coulomb and $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, and I get about 4.5 eV which is pretty big.
Dividing that by the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ gives about 52,000 Kelvin, which is simultaneously hot compared to the Sun's photosphere's temperature of about ~5,800 Kelvin, and not hot compared to the Sun's corona temperature of roughly 5,000,000 Kelvin.
This suggest to me that since the Sun is mostly hydrogen, it makes sense to ask
