Measuring time and distance in space

When reading through articles about discovering gravitational waves, I got basic understanding of events that happened. But one thing wasn't clear for me. They say that two black holes collided 1.3 billion years ago. 
My question is, how can we know, that this collision happened 1.3 billion years ago?
