Outside of a Universe and its origin

Per the Big Bang Theory, the universe was formed from a dense singular point which existed 13 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. This suggests that the point should have existed somewhere in space implying an outer universe. If we call this point the "Universe", then what do we call the space that held that point? Also how did this single point come into existence in the first place?
