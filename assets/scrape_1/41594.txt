How is bond albedo calculated?

According to this website, Bond albedos are computed by calculating the ratio of the flux reflected by a planet (integrated over wavelength) to the total stellar flux incident on the planet.
Three questions:


How to arrive to "the ratio of the flux reflected by" the earth?
How to arrive to "the total stellar flux incident on" the earth?
How to compute the two together?
