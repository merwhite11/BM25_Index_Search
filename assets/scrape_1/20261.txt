So is there nothing like satellite anymore?

I just read this article. I don't know how credible it is, since I couldn't find any link to the original paper. But it says that pluto will be considered a planet again, along with more than 100 other celestial objects including our moon. So, if the definition given here is applied, then would there be anything as dwarf planet or satellite? I think even comets and asteriouds would come under this defintion. I am talking about this:

The paper, published in Lunar and Planetary Science, declares a planet as a round body that's never undergone fusion, and has less mass than a star. That's it. This means, Pluto would be planet again-- But it would also bring along Ceres, Eris, Makemake and Haumea... as well as 97 other objects.
