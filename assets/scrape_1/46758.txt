Is gravity affected by time dilation?

I just thought about what time realy is but I can't put my head around this so I was thinking that if time dilation happens at the edge of a black hole that just everything gets slower. But does gravity also get slower/weaker?
For example, if I drop something on earth it falls to the ground at speeds I know of. But what if we move earth now at a very close orbit of a super massive black hole. (lets just assume that a stable orbit close to the event horizon is possible and spagetthification is negated by the super massive aspect of the black hole or just doesn't exist in this example)
At this earth near the black hole, I am very slow from an outside observer because my time frame is so slow. When I drop now something, is the speed of falling still the same for me on this earth? Would an outside observer also see the falling object in slow motion?
If gravity is affected by time dilation, would not this mean that it would be impossible to see merging black holes as an outside observer because the time dilation is infinite at the moment when the black holes horizons are touching so you would forever see two nearly touching black holes? This would also affect gravitation waves because the time dilation is so big that the waves are frozen in time.
If gravity is not affected by time dilation, would that mean that gravity is something absolute. Meaning that I know I being affected by time dilation by dropping things at 1g and observe how fast it is falling (Because I am slower but the object is still falling at 'normal' speed)?
