Do/Can Ringed Stars Exist?

The other night, while playing Elite: Dangerous, I came across a rather strange celestial body - one I never imagined possible.
It was a Brown Dwarf star with a very large ring.

Is something like this even remotely possible? Have such objects actually been seen?
It was also quite interesting that this star wasn't even the primary star in the system. It was orbiting a larger star (blue-white, I think), along with several planets.
