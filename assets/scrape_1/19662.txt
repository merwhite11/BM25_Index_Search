extrasolar comets - basic question

How can an extrasolar comet be detected - this is based on an article regarding the influence on a extra solar gas giant on these comets causing changes in their orbit and leading to them being swallowed by the star ..
Still stuck on understanding how we detect them .. they certainly have no measurable effect on the movement of the planet or the star .. and the chemical make-up of the comet seems irrelevant given the size of the star and observations we can make ? Just missing something Simple I think ?
