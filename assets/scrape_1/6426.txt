Is the location that published calendars use to calculate the seasons one specific location on the earth?

All the calendars in my house say the fall equinox is Tuesday the 23rd. All the astronomical programs and astronomical sources say it is it is Monday the 22nd in Ohio. Since the time given is 10:29 p.m. EDT all of the US starts fall on Monday. Iâ€™m guessing the calendars use Greenwich Time. This same discussion also applies to when calendars show the full moon dates.
I know this isn't exactly an astonomy question, but I thought this site was the closest I could get.
