Where should I be looking to see Neowise in southern Sweden?

I'm in the south of Sweden and just spent over an hour trying to find Neowise, but didn't see it. I live in a rural area, there are no lights nearby and there is a small hill with clear visibility between north and northeast. I went out at 00:45 (GMT+2) and came back in at 02:00, not having seen anything resembling a comet, not even with binoculars.
News outlets around here are saying everything from "Look towards the Big Dipper and you'll see it" to "Between north and north-east", or "To the west in the evening and east in the morning". Many say that it would be somewhere "down to the left of Capella". Frankly it's quite frustrating to not be able to find neither Neowise nor a surefire description of how to locate it.
This photo is taken to the north-east around 01:45 (GMT+2). Where in relation to the stars on the photo would Neowise be? The brightest one is Capella according to Sky Maps.
