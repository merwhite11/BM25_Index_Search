How close is a typical New Moon to the Sun in the sky?

In a Solar Eclipse, the Sun, Earth and Moon are exactly colinear (well some area of the Earth where the eclipse is visible), and these are relatively rare.
But in addition, Sun, Earth and Moon are approximately colinear at every New Moon; indeed in a 2D projection it would look like there ought to be a Solar Eclipse every month.
This got me curious: if I could see the New Moon in the sky somehow, and at every New Moon I traced the minimum angular distance between the Sun and Moon, what would this typically be? Presumably this would be in fact 0 degrees at a full Solar Eclipse, but what about an "average" non-eclipsing New Moon?
In other words, how close is a typical New Moon to the Sun? Is it skirting around the edges somewhere, or a fair old distance etc. Would it be closer than Venus, say?
These questions touch on the subject but don't actually answer the angular distance part:

What is the difference between New Moon day and Lunar Eclipse?
Why can't we see a solar eclipse every month?
