would the Solar Gravitational Lens Mission be looking at a specific exoplanet?

Quoting https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2020_Phase_I_Phase_II/Direct_Multipixel_Imaging_and_Spectroscopy_of_an_Exoplanet/, the proposed Solar Gravitational Lens Mission would "directly image a habitable Earth-like exoplanet within our stellar neighborhood".
My question is...  what exoplanet would it be imaging? wikipedia has a whole list of exoplanets that have been found:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_exoplanets
Is it in that list?
