Modern equivalent of Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus?

I understand that the Meeus book is a classic in astronomical calculations. I've read through many chapters of it now and while the content is great, it'd be nice to have discussion based on more recent context.
Is there a "modern equivalent" to this classic book?
