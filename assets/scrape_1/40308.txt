Has the Earth-facing side of the Moon that we see today always faced us ever since the Moon got tidally locked? Or does it precess?

Title. Does the Earth-facing side of the Moon slowly precess due to perturbations and torques exerted by other bodies? Or is the side of the Moon we see today the same as when it first got tidally locked?
P.S. I know we don't see the exact same side of the Moon   everytime due to libration. That's not what I'm asking.
