Why did Chandrasekhar use 2.5 for molecular weight in 1931?

I understand that the history of the Chandrasekhar limit is complicated (see, for example, Edmund C. Stoner and the Discovery of the Maximum Mass of White Dwarfs, Michael Nauenberg, JHA 39:297, 2008 / PDF) but what puzzles me is the physics rather than the history. In his 1931 paper (The Maximum Mass Of Ideal White Dwarfs, ApJ 74:81), Chandrasekhar used a value of 2.5 for mean molecular mass. Why? I thought that it is 2.0 for metals and much less for hydrogen and helium.
