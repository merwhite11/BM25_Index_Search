Why doesn't the Moon, like the Sun, turn bright red when it's close to the horizon?

Why does the Moon, being close to the horizon, turn red only slightly, or not at all?
Aren't the causes that lead to the coloring of the Sun (atmospheric refraction) are also true for the Moon?
In addition, the spectrum of moonlight is more red-shifted than that of the sun, so shouldn't that contribute to an even more intense reddening of the lunar disk than the sun?
