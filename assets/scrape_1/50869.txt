What is the rotational speed of Sagittarius A*?

Sagittarius A* is the Milky Way's own supermassive black hole. Up till recently, I used to think that Sagittarius A* was a static black hole, i.e. It had no rotational speed at all.
But after doing a bit of research on black holes, I found out that Sagittarius A* is actually a Kerr-Newman black hole, i.e. it rotates. But apart from that, there was no available data on its rotational speed. What vague information I have found suggests that it rotates only slowly, but even then, there is no information about its rotational speed.
