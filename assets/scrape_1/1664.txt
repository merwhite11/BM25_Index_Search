To what extent are structure formations unexplained?

I hear conflicting claims about our understanding of the structure formation in our universe. I heard that Î›CDM explaines well the large scale structure of the universe i.e.

Comparison of the model with observations is very successful on large
  scales (larger than galaxies, up to the observable horizon)

and then I read the opposite on nasa.gov:

However, we still do not understand how these structures condensed
  out of the 'primordial soup'. The formation of structure appears much
  quicker than the current theories would have it!

So what is Lambda-CDM actually good at and what are its potential weaknesses, if there is any?
