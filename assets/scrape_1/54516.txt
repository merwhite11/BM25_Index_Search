given angular diameter distance turnaround, is it then that the background microwave radiation is now background because it was 'close' initially?

the idea of objects nearer the start of the visible universe appearing larger to us now because when their light started out they were nearer to us leads to the idea that the "largest" such "image" would be a distribution of radiation found everywhere you looked, like the cosmic microwave background; is that a correct interpretation?
in this case i would think the "object" and its "light" would be the primordial soup, so it's not like it would mean there were two identifiable lobes of the big bang, two "objects" at the outset, and one of them happened to have the place we now inhabit on its energy surface and the other was "down the block" originally, but is the idea applicable to all the radiation we can measure from 'somewhere out there'?
