Position of the Moon viewed from same spot couple of months apart

In the below image, the position of the moon as viewed from the same spot is displayed. 
The drawing to the left is from today at local time of 2am.
The drawing to the right is from a couple of months ago at a local time of 10pm. 
How is it possible for the moon to be at roughly the same spot with such a difference in time?
