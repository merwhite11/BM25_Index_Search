How to phase fold data when periodicity change is known as d$\omega$/d$t$?

How can I obtain a phase-folded phase - velocity diagramme from a time series of radial velocity data when it is known that the periodicity changes as $\frac{{d}\omega}{{d}t}$?
Without $\frac{{d}\omega}{{d}t}$ it is:
p = ((T-Tref)/P)%1.0

$T$ is a time
$T_{ref}$ is a reference time
$P$ is a period
$p$ is fold phase
Many thanks
