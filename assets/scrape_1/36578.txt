Is Jupiter as opaque as it looks?

Although it is impossible to tell what is and isn't false color (aside from the adage that it probably is false).  It's inarguable that no picture of a gas giant shows any depth or significant transparency.  Of course this could just be because a single camera lacks depth perception, and since the planets are gas almost completely gas, there are no underlying boundaries to detect any transparency.
In particular what is the visibility inside the various conditions on Jupiter?  Could you see 1,000 km in every direction, or is it more like a constant fog or dust storm (with frozen ammonia instead of dust)?  What if you brought your own light source?
