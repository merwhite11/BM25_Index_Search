Rest-frame magnitudes and fluxes

I have a question concerning rest-frame vs observed frame. In the observer frame, I can define an apparent magnitude and an absolute magnitude (as the apparent magnitude if the object were at d=10pc). From the apparent magnitude I can calculate the flux of the galaxy in the observed filter.
Now let's say I have a set of galaxies from which I know the rest-frame absolute magnitudes. Is there such a thing as a rest-frame apparent magnitude or a rest-frame flux?
