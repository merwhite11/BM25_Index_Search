Local neighbourhood and Superclusters

Recently, I watched a YouTube video on Limits of Humanity, by famous Youtube channel Kurzgesagt. It talked about the local neighbourhood, and it is the only group of galaxies which are gravitationally bound to us.
Other galaxies and groups of galaxies are speeding away due to the expansion of our universe and are not gravitationally bound to us.
But I got confused because our supercluster of galaxies will obviously contain millions of these "local neighbourhoods", and if these individual groups are not gravitationally bound to us then how is our supercluster even stable? It should not have been formed in the first place since no groups are gravitationally bound to each other, but indeed it is a structure that we have identified, and is obviously formed by gravity only.
Am I misunderstanding something? Any help is massively appreciated!
