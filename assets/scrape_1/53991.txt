How will the 2023 occultation of Betelgeuse be seen from Iran?

I was looking at the Wikipedia page for 319 Leona and I got excited to know that it will occult the bright star Betelgeuse on December 12, 2023 (It's predicted with the use of Solex application):

On 12 December 2023 at about 01:09â€“01:27 UT, Leona will occult Betelgeuse as seen from southern Europe, Turkey, Greece and Sicily. The 14th magnitude asteroid will occult Betelgeuse (block or reduce the light) for about 12 seconds. Betelgeuse is expected to dim by about 3 magnitudes. Light curve studies of the event may help understand the distribution of brightness over the disk of Betelgeuse.

Then I searched to find the map of this occultaion and I found this. Of course, the webpage is in Japanese. So I translated it.
Well, the world map was very hard to find if the occultation is visible in Iran or not. So I clicked on a link to a map of Turkey which Iran was in it as well.
From there I found that a little of Iran's soil near the border with Azerbaijan is in the outernmost part of the asteroid's shadow.
It is obvious that people in central Azerbaijan can see the occultation with no problem (unless there is a bad weather). But what about Iran? Can people from the Azerbaijan-Iran borderline see a good occultation as well?
Well, I am Iranian myself and I don't want to miss this rare opportunity :(
Also, if you can help me to determine the exact UTC time the shadow reaches Azerbaijan-Iran border it will be very appreciated.
