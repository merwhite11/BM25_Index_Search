How do we know the big bang expanded space and there wasn't a pre-existing volume for the universe to expand into?

Whenever we hear an explanation about the big bang, it is always phrased in such a way that it was an explosion which used some kind of pressure to expanded the universe out.
I wonder, however, would it be possible that our universe bubble started as a point that wrapped around the singularity and contained it.  Then, for some reason, this bubble started to expand, which caused the energy in the singularity to fill the newly created empty space.
Could it be that this bubble, which is now our universe, is still expanding, and the universe is still trying to fill the space, which is why we see dark energy?
Could we even know, or would either way look exactly the same to us?
