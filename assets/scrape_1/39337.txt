When does a solar eclipse become noticeable?

For a human viewer located on Earth, is there an approximate apparent magnitude at which a solar eclipse becomes apparent in the form of a noticeable change in ambient brightness?
Assume normal atmospheric conditions, etc.
Note, I am not interested in the noticeability of the Moon covering the Sun, but whether someone outside would think, "Hey, it looks darker than usual today!"
