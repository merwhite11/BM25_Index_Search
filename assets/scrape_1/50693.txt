Do these results mean that I have found this exoplanet?

Yesterday I was going through the TESS mission data on mast portal and after applying some filters I found some data. I started analyzing that data using the lightkurve library.
plot without using the periodogram script:

Running all the scripts I found this plot:

Then I searched after this star system on the exomast archive portal just to check that this system wasn't analyzed earlier by researchers and I am not wasting my time.
The portal didn't show any results which means that TESS researchers haven't studied this one yet and was not confirmed as an exoplanet.
Does this mean that I found it?
And what should I do now with this?
If this was already known I have no problem, this was fun to analyze.
