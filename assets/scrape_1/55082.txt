Moon's libration from Mathematica data

Wolfram Mathematica provides "TransitTime" option (for the Moon in particular).
Knowing this time moment, you can get the position of the moon at upper culmination
(for example, for each day of the year).
So I got the following plot:

and the question arose:

Is it real picture of Moon's librations?
Or it may be inaccuracy in Mathematica data?
Or it consequence of incorrect "experiment" (equation of time was not taken into account etc)
