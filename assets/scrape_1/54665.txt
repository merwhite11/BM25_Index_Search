Orekit converting to galactic coordinates

I started using OreKit in a 3D star charting app I am writing in JavaFX. I wanted to convert from equatorial to galactic coordinates.
I can do it simply by using the transformations, but I wanted to use Orekit, so I'm not writing code when a library will do.
The docs in Orekit aren't very good, so I did a search and found this:
   Frame icrf = FramesFactory.getICRF();
   Frame galactic = FramesFactory.getGalactic();
   ... more code

Frame galactic = FramesFactory.getGalactic(); doesn't seem to exist anymore in Orekit, and I can't seem to find what replaces it.
Anyone know?
