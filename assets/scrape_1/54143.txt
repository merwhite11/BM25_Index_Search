How can I differentiate between Jupiter and Venus in the sky?

Venus and Jupiter both appear to be of similar brightness in the sky, although, Venus appears to be slightly brighter than Jupiter. Sometimes when only one of them is in the sky, it is difficult to tell if it is Venus or Jupiter. Is there any way I could tell with certainty which planet is it? irrespective of the month of the year or location.
Obviously, I know about sky map related apps. However, spotting a planet with naked eye is more fun.
