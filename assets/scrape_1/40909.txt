Significance of astronomical twilight

What is the significance of astronomical twilight? Astronomical twilight is when "the geometric center of the Sun's disk is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon" , but what, if any, is the significance of that event?
Here's a description of what astronomical twilight is, but I fail to see any mention of the event's significance.
