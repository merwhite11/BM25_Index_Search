How common for all 7 planets to be above the horizon?

I was planning for the Solar Eclipse in April 8th 2024 and noticed that at the time of totality at my location in Western NY, all 7 planets will be above the horizon. Earlier in the day it's all of them plus Pluto.
My question is how common is it for all the solar system planets to be above the horizon at the same time?
I believe the answer will come easier if atmospheric effects are ignored.
