How to explain tidal tails and dark matter sub-halos in simple terms?

There is the exciting news by ESA  entitled Is the nearest star cluster to the Sun being destroyed?

Data from ESAâ€™s Gaia star mapping satellite have revealed tantalising evidence that the nearest star cluster to the Sun is being disrupted by the gravitational influence of a massive but unseen structure in our galaxy.

I heard about dark-matter sub-halos and tidal tails before, but I am by no means an expert and Wikipedia is not too helpful for my question: I would like to use ESA's animation on Hyades tidal tails to explain the terms "dark matter halo" and "tidal tails" in 2 minutes. Consider that my audience probably heard the term "dark matter" before, but they have to be reminded about it. The term "galaxy" may be used, maybe even "star cluster", but not much more. May you help me, please?
