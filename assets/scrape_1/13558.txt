Is this Universe scenario correct?

I will try to give you my reasoning behind my scenario.
Ok I've researched and found 

That 95 percent of the galaxy has been formed already, And the
other 5 percent is still to come.http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-11/almost-all-stars-are-old-and-universe-making-hardly-any-new-ones
I've also found that stars can
    live up to 10 billion years.
the Universe is around 13 billion
years old.
Much much more stars die than new stars are born and
around 9 billion years ago the new stars being born dropped to 30
percent.
If number 4 and 2 are correct almost all the stars in
the universe should of died already.
Black holes are formed either by two neutron star colliding or a supernova. 
If 5 is correct there should be a huge amount of black holes left from all
the stars that supernovaed.
Black holes can consume one another and form a larger mass.
If our galaxy is 4.5 billion years old
and 5 percent of the galaxy is still unformed we are almost consider
one of the last formed galaxy and should be on the outer edge of the
universe if we are 4.5 billion years old, So that could give us
about 5 billion years left.
the references I found lean towards saying new stars hardly form.And there is a estimated 100,000,000 Black holes in the galaxy as of now.
A massive Black hole has to be 80 percent of our Universe  by now and slowly making its way toward our galaxy.
Please tell me where my info was wrong.

Will our solar system die of old age in 5.4 billion years or will we be consumed by the massive black hole if this scenario is plausible?
