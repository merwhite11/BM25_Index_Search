How can I calculate 27 tropical/solar year since my birthdate?

Let's say I was born on 27th November 1993 at 03:15:15 AM. Is there any way I can calculate exact 27 tropical cycle since my birthdate/birthtime. 
What date and what time it will be after exact 27 tropical years since my birthdate/birthtime?
