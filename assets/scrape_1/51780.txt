Approximately what percent of the sky has nothing in it?

From my persepective here on Earth, the sky seems to look like a few large-ish things and a bunch of tiny things.  Hubble teaches us that even the apparent void between the tiny things has many very tiny things.  Stuff that is very near takes up a large portion of what I see.  For example, the Earth takes up about 50% of what I can see, because I'm right next to it.  The Moon takes up a circle that is about half a degree in diameter or so, depending on what day it is.  A small-angle approximation gives that this takes up about $\frac{\pi(0.25)^2}{41253} \approx 0.00048\%$ of the sky. (there are about 41253 square degrees in the sky)
The percent of the sky that "has stuff in it" changes dramatically hour by hour as the Earth spins round, since it occupies so much of our view.  This change in time also occurs due to the motions of all of the heavenly bodies, but minus the Earth I would imagine the value would change relatively little over large periods of time, except during eclipses.
Minus the Earth, and barring an eclipse, when we add up all of the Sun, the Moon, the planets and the stars, what percent of the night sky is still just empty or nearly-empty space?
