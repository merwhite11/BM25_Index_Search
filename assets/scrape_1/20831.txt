Why do neutrinos take time to scatter?

After a supernova neutrinos get released by electron capture,and they escape in a flood.
My guess is because they have tiny masses and get momentum from momentum conservation.

However, the huge number of neutrinos it emits carry away so much energy that the temperature of an isolated neutron star falls within a few years to around $10^6$ kelvin.

Wouldn't most of the neutrinos scatter after supernova almost instantaneously before a formation of a neutron star?
