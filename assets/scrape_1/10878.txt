What kind of things I could "see" with an amateur radio telescope?

There are apparently not many reasonably priced radio telescopes available for the amateur users. I only could find a SPIDER 230C 2.3 meter diameter compact radio telescope, which costs ~10 kâ‚¬. Reading the page, I don't get a good overview what kind of things I could "see" with a radio telescope that has a 2.3 meter antenna.
Is the instrument already a (semi-)professional one?
