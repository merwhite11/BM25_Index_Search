How does a planet lose mass to its host star?

How do bodies like WASP-12b lose mass to its central body? The process is never really explained in popular media, instead showing visualisations of a thin veil of gas being "sucked" in a rather straight line (and then into a ring around the star) rising straight from the surface of the planet. I highly doubt the mechanics which these illustration insinuate: Gravitation isn't working like a vacuum cleaner on a dusty rug. Either the rug goes with it, or the dust stays on the rug. The only mechanism that I can think of are particles from the upper atmosphere which happen to pick up enough thermodynamic energy so that they are faster than the escape velocity of the planet. But is this a process which effects a big enough mass transfer to be of significance? Do I overlook something? How is such a mass defect going on really?
