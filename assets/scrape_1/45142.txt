Cryogenic black holes

In a hypothetical case  take a hydrogen gas. If we start cooling it down to the point where its core temperature is 0 K, does  the electrons become still and fall into the nucleus due to the fact there is no energy to maintain it in the electron cloud? Does this become a black hole? If yes, would this mean that the temperature of the core (singularity) of a black hole is 0 K? If you are frozen in subatomic stage, then you would experience slow time movement as if  you were near a black hole (also due to gravitation pull). As we know, heat transfers from higher temperature to lower temperature, and the black hole is like a sink for all hot matter. That's why when matter falls into the black hole it becomes red hot, but since the black hole is more massive it is not quite enough to heat it up. It's like making a campfire on a iceberg. Can it be possible?
