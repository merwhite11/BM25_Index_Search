Have parameters been determined for the Fourier components of a Milky Way spiral density-potential model?

Spiral arms in galaxies can be modeled by potentials of the form
$$\Phi_{\text{spiral}}(R,\theta,z,t)=\sum_mA_m(R,z)\cos(m\theta-m\theta_0-\phi_m(R)-\Omega_pt)$$
where $A_m(R,z)$ is the $m$th-order coefficient based on some potential - such as a Miyamoto-Nagai potential - $\phi_m(R)$ is a function typically of the form
$$\phi_m(R)=\alpha_m\ln (R/R_{0,m})$$
for some characteristic radius $R$, and $\Omega_p$ is some pattern speed. I've read that typically the $m=0$ component dominates, followed by the $m=2$ term. There may also be an $m=4$ term, though it is typically weaker.
This model describes the disk component of a galaxy with two main spiral arms. The spiral arms of the Milky Way are more complicated; some consider it to have two major arms and two more subordinate arms, while others consider it to have four major arms.
Have any potential or density models of the Milky Way been created using these Fourier components, and if so, what are the parameters used (the $m$s, $A_m$s, $\phi_m$s, and $R_{0,m}$s)?
