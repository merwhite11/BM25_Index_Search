What are the one-dimensional observables that can reveal the matter clustering properties of the Universe?

As we all know, the distribution of galaxies, which depend on the spatial coordinates, can help us understand the large-scale structure of the Universe. We can measure the distribution of galaxies from the Sky Survey Project directly, or examine it from the Hydro/N-body simulations.
My question is that if there are any observables that just depend on the distance to us, i.e. the scale. If so, such observables are one-dimensional.
