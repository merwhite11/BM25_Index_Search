Why do most dwarf planets have mass comparable to moon?

It was quite interesting to spot that most dwarf planets have masses close to that of our moon (if we let an error to fluctuate within two orders of magnitude).
Why it is so? Is there any common denominator of this phenomena? Maybe it's because all dwarf planets share similar formation roots/causes with the moon? Or is this just a very big and strange coincidence?
