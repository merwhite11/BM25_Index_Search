Refinement to sun/wristwatch estimate of N/S direction

As discussed in a 2015 question here
and shown in a 2013 illustration in Primer Magazine,
it's possible to estimate the north/south direction on the ground using a correlation between the hour hand of an analog watch and the azimuth of the Sun.

As Wikipedia:Analog watch suggests, the relation between hour angle and azimuth depends on latitude:

The method functions less well as one gets closer to the equator.

Also the Sun's declination affects its azimuth around 6 AM or PM.
Assuming that the observer has already determined the local apparent solar time,
what further correction could they apply to estimate the north/south direction more accurately?
I expect that this would be a function of the observer's latitude φ, the Sun's declination δ, and the Sun's hour angle h.
