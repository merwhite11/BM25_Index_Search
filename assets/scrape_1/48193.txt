14,000 square degrees

The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys says it produces a model of “the 14,000 square degrees of extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere”. But I thought the whole celestial sphere (like any other sphere) had only $(180/\pi)^2 \approx 3282.8$ square degrees. How should I understand this? Is this counting each of the 7 bands it scans in (in which case it’s an average of 62% of the whole sky)?
