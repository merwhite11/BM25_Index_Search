How can the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) warn of incoming solar storms?

How can the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) warn of incoming solar storms when is is invested with radiation?
Discovery.com article Solar Storm Warning Satellite on Last Legs states that:

Until the sun's free-flying and highly energetic outbursts, known as
  coronal mass ejections, hit the ACE spacecraft, forecasters don't know
  the orientation of their embedded magnetic fields.

I read that it can give 15 minutes in advance warning to Earth of the presence of an incoming solar storm. However to do that, it sends a radio signal which goes at the same speed of the solar storm so it will presumably take 15 minutes as well?
