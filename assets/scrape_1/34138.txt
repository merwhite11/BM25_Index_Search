Why does the 70-solar-mass black hole in the LB-1 system challenge current astrophysics?

Recently scientists discovered a large stellar-mass black hole, which (previously) they believed that it shouldn't be possible in our galaxy!

An international team of scientists say they have discovered a
  stellar-mass black hole with a mass 70 times greater than the sun — so
  large it defies current theories on how black holes of its kind form.

Why shouldn't it be present in our galaxy system? Are there any physical or mathematical calculations that defy its existence?
