What aliphatic compounds were found on Ceres, and how where they identified?

Los Angeles Times's article NASA's Dawn mission finds life's building blocks on dwarf planet Ceres says;

While the scientists arenâ€™t sure exactly what the compounds are, the fingerprint is characteristic of material containing carbon-hydrogen bonds, and may include components like methyl and methylene.

I've located the mentioned Science article Localized aliphatic organic material on the surface of Ceres but it is paywalled.
What was found? Is it some spectroscopic feature? Aliphatic compounds are hydrocarbons that are not aromatic. Is there a spectral feature that says "I am not aromatic" specifically, or does this just mean that aromaticity was not detected?
