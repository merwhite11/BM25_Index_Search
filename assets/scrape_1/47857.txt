Can a star undergo helium fusion after depleting all its hydrogen?

For stars around the mass of the sun, helium fusion occurs concurrently with late hydrogen shell burning.
For stars smaller than the sun, is their a subset that first burn all their hydrogen store before initiating helium fusion in their cores?
Is this possible, or is the environment during hydrogen shell burning more preferential than during late gravitational collapse?
