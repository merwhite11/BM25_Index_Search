Image of the black hole

The first ever image of a black hole shows a circular black central portion surrounded by an illuminated accretion disk.

If a black hole wraps spacetime completely around it, then in any direction it should look like a fireball totally illuminated in all directions.
Why does the actual image show black in the centre, or again it is only imagination by slicing the sphere?
