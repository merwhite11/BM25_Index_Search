Spiral Galaxies

I only have a very, very, basic understanding of linear motion, much less so of circular motion. What I can recall is my book telling me if you spin a stone tied to the end of a string and the string breaks, the stone will fly off at a tangent to its orbit and not spiral away or anything else like radially, etc.
Gravity is that string and stars are the stone and whatever supermassive object (some say they're supermassive blackholes) is at the center of spiral galaxies exerting this pull of gravity, my knowledge (as disclosed vide supra) can't explain the spiralness of spiral galaxies.
Any simple explanation on how spiral galaxies form will be deeply appreciated.
