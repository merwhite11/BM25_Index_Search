sideways crescent moon but also no moon somewhere else?

I live in Sumter, South Carolina and the moon looked like a crescent moon but sideways like a bowl. But when I told my friend to look at the moon they couldn't find it and they live in Buffalo, New York. I am really confused on what is happening because I couldn't find any information about it.
