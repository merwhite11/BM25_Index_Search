Earendel and HD1; identifying population 3 stars and galaxies

Will JWST be able to tell if Earendel, a 12.9 billion year old star, is a population 3 star?  Or do we already know from the current Hubble observations that Earendel is a population 3 star?
I've read that population 3 stars are the previously never observed first stars in the universe which would have formed from only primordial hydrogen and helium and a little lithium, and would lack all other heavier elements, and which might have other unusual properties.
Also, will JWST be able to tell if galaxy HD1, a recently observed 13.5 billion year old galaxy consists of population 3 stars?  EarthSky Most distant galaxy yet discovered says:

Scientists estimate that HD1 is forming more than 100 stars every
single year. This rate is at least 10 times higher than a normal
starburst galaxy. This is one of the reasons they think the galaxy is
not forming “normal” stars.

If 100 stars are forming every year, might there also be 100 supernova every year as well, and would they be visible to JWST, or other observatories?  What might we learn about those earliest stars and galaxies?
Also, if this is a mostly population 3 star galaxy then most of the supernova could be incredibly bright pair instability supernova.  Might the brightness of HD1 be explained by these much brighter and longer lasting pair supernova?  HD1 could in effect always be shining by light mostly generated from dozens of Pair-instability-supernova.
