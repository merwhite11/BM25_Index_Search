Paper recommendations for career guidance

I'm an undergraduate student in astronomy and I'm one year from graduating, but I feel I still can't choose what career path I want to pursue. To date I've only had two courses of proper astrophysics and I liked them both. I have a notion of cosmology (CMB, B modes) and basic stellar astrophysics but I would like to explore more fields of research. Maybe this is too much to ask but it would really be of help a list of papers that describe, in general of course, different fields. It's something like this I want to read https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9512285. If you know more papers like this please share them, they could be about exoplanets, star populations, mergers, AGNs, astrochemistry, weird stars, anything. Thank you in advance.
