What new fundamental knowledge could a very, very large optical telescope bring?

Very large baseline radio telescopes bring many mysteries of the cosmos to us. We build them because they are feasible.
Say, in the future, we could build very large optical telescopes in deep space, either with physically large mirrors, or via breakthroughs in interferometry, to get diameters or at least effective apertures in the order of a few to tens of kilometers.
Would this bring us fundamentally new knowledge of the cosmos or merely pretty pictures, say of the flares on distant suns, that are incremental advances to our understanding?
