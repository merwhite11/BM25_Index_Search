Where would be the absolute most logical place in USA to observe the total solar eclipse on August 21, 2017?

Cloudy weather would defeat the purpose so I am guessing that the western states would be more ideal due to greater chance of clear sky.  Isolation would also be nice.  At a camp site on or near a mountain top.  Also, are there efforts to set up mobile solar observatories in the totality path?
