Are the Venusian "continents" likely to have existed before the global resurfacing event?

A topographic map of the surface of Venus shows the large highland areas Ishtar Terra, Aphrodite Terra and Lada Terra that have occasionally been described as "continents", plus various other smaller regions such as Beta Regio. Are these "continents" likely to have existed before the global resurfacing event, or is the topography of the planet likely to have been completely altered?
