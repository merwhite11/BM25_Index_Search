What is the probability of life having developed or going to develop in our solar system another time?

I'm sorry I am not quite sure this question satisfies this point:

Questions that are purely hypothetical, for example a question such as 'Could a black hole destroy the universe' or 'What if our solar system had two suns' (however, feel free to visit World Building)

But actually I am not asking hypothetically.
Given the timespan it took to develop life on earth, I wonder if we can project this to life having already developed once or going to develop again in the solar system.
I'm referring to the fact that during suns lifespan the habitable zone shifts towards other areas.
This won't last only for a few centuries, right? But for millions to billions of years.
Some of the planets and other celestial bodies contain the basic elements to host life (as we know it) already. And then there's stuff floating around in the belts that could bombard those bodies.
E.g. this article claims a study found:

Researchers studying the crater said investigations by the Mars Science Laboratory have confirmed the presence of an ancient lake that existed in the Gale crater for up to 10 million years, indicating that parts of Mars may once have been habitable for thousands of years.

I'm not sure how to go from 10 million years to thousands of years. Thousands of years might not have been enough for substantial life to develop, but millions of years sounds more possible.
Just for reference this video got me to the question:



(of course it's just a fun video)
