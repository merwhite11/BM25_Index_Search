Do any particles in AGN jets escape the galaxy?

I have read, at http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/Black-holes.html for example, that whole stars can be ejected from certain galaxies. "These are thought to have been part of a binary star system that broke apart as it approached a supermassive black hole. As one star was captured, and the other was pushed away at a velocity exceeding the escape velocity of the Galaxy."
My question is about the jets that can form at the poles of the rotating supermassive black hole: "At the rotation axis of the supermassive black hole, matter from the accretion disc can be pushed away at the speed of light, creating jets that can extend for thousands of light-years."
At thousands of light-years away, is this matter still gravitationally bound to the galaxy?  (If not, maybe some particles can go around in a big loop that takes a while.)
