How many stars can be seen naked eye from outside the atmosphere? How dense is the "sky" from there?

When I was 20, I went to Naxos (Greece) with friends. I was driving my car during the night on the mount Zeus (1003 meters - 3,291 ft) listening Pink Floyd.
Up there we stopped the car to take a walk, looked above and ... wooooooowwwwww!
The sky was dense! Full of stars. We didn't know it could have been like that.
My question is:

How dense is the deep sky from outside the atmosphere?

For example, on the ISS during the night (the Earth that cover the Sun) looking at the deep sky, how many stars can you see? I saw a lot of pictures of the stars taken by the Hubble telescope), but I don't think it can be compared, right?
