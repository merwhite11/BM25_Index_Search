What is the long term fate of the gas giants?

If I'm not mistaken, it is believed that the reason for such turbulent weather on the 4 outer gas giant planets is that the internal pressure is so great that it is generating heat, which is causing convection, which causes extreme weather.
Will these planets forever generate heat, or at some point will they freeze up?
