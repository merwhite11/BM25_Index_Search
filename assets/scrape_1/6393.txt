Why are (Type II) supernovae so bright?

The vast majority of energy from a supernova is emitted as neutrinos and high-energy radiation, both of which being invisible to the naked eye. Yet a supernova can outshine its galaxy in the visible spectrum for weeks.
How is a supernova generating so much visible light that nuclear fusion pales in comparison?
What is the ratio of visible and invisible energy emitted by a supernova, and how does it compare to stars' normal operation?
