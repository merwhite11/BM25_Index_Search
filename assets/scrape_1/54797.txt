Orion stars distance from Earth

For a textbook I'm creating a figure depicting the distances of Orion constellation's stars  from Earth.
However i wasn't able to found an Official Scientific catalog of most recent stars distance measurement and when looking on non-scientific websites (including Wikipedia) i found distances that varies most of the time from 50% to 300%............
Do someone know where i can found an official scientific catalog (database) with the latest measurements. Or confirm the following distances below:

Bellatrix 244.6 ly
Meissa 1,109 ly
Betelgeuse 500-600 ly
Mintaka 1,240 ly
Alnilam 2,000 ly
Alnitak 1,262 ly
Saiph 650 ly
Rigel 864.3 ly

Thanks for your help
