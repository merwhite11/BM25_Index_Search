two black holes orbiting each other within their event horizon

Is there any argument against this situation: two black holes, one within the event horizon of the other, and the system is stable.
It is interesting to me because that if this works, we could have the system's event horizon not in the shape of a perfect sphere. (The event horizon would probably be moving with the orbit)
