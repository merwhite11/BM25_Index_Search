Radius to which all hydrogen-burning stars are known?

For the purposes of this question, I wish to consider active, hydrogen-burning stars, not deuterium-burning brown dwarfs,  or stellar remnants like black holes or neutron stars. (Though including those would be interesting questions in and of themselves)
What is the upper limit of distance that we can say, "To a high degree of certainty, every star that exists within this sphere centered on the Solar System, has been discovered?"
