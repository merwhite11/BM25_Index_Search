Black hole at Galactic Center of the Milky way and Bar of stars?

The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, with a supermassive black hole at its center. Here
As it is a barred spiral galaxy, it has a centralÂ bar-shaped structure composed of stars.Here
So my questions are -:

Do the bar and supermassive black hole overlap or cross each other?
Do the stars from the bar get sucked inside the supermassive black hole?
