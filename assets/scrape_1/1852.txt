Can an amateur astronomer bounce a laser off the moon?

In the TV show "Big Bang Theory" episode "The Lunar Excitation", the gang fires a laser from their rooftop, bounces it off mirrors on the moon, and measures the laser coming back on a computer.
Is this really possible?
I know scientists have successfully done this, because it's why NASA put the mirrors on the moon.
Wouldn't this require very precise targeting by the laser to hit the mirrors?
My question is, is it possible for an amateur to successfully perform this experiment?
