Distance of a planet to the star?

QUESTION: 
Suppose we discover a planet orbiting a nearby star. 
The distance to the star is 3 pc. 
We observe the angular radius of the planetâ€™s orbit to be 0.1 arc sec. 
How many AU from the star is the planet? 
**CONCERN: I am not sure what "The distance to the star is 3 pc" means. The earth's distance to the star? or the sun's distance to the star? or even better, the planet's distance to the star??!!
Any explanation of the question would be greatly appreciated!
My initial approach was some fixed position (say sun/earth's distance) to the star is 3pc, 
so I will have    0.1 arc sec = 3pc/distance, and solve for distance as the answer.
(I reckon this is a very simple question for astrophysics, but I need to get basics right)
