Do anti-particle black hole exist and can they evaporate?

I know that virtual particles are constantly be created and annihilated even in a complete vacuum, I like to know if there exist such a mechanism to spawn an anti-particle black hole can be any size not necessary stellar? I think black hole lose mass by gradually throwing out one of the pair of virtual particles before they could cancel out each other, so would this also apply to an anti-particle black hole as well if it does exists?
