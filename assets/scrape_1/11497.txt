Calculate Atmospheric Extinction Using Source Altitude Angle

I am trying to code up the following article http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2349512 (alternative free access version) to calculate the light reflected from the moon to a given point on earth at a given time. However I occasionally get a gross error when calculating the distance of the light path through the atmosphere (Figure 2. of the article.)

The approximation given is to take the inverse sine of right ascension in radians, however whenever RA approaches pi, the number blows out to 8e15. Can you suggest a better method?
