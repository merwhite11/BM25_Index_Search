Where is the Moon for the last five or six days?

The date today is March 18th 2021 Thursday it's 6:00 p.m. I'm in the area of Sarasota-Bradenton Florida. I haven't seen the moon and it's been clear skies for roughly the last five or six nights... I see all the consolation of the Stars where they're supposed to be but I cannot find the Moon. It makes me nervous and I'd like to know why?
