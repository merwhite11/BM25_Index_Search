Given the vast scale of the universe, why the Fermi Paradox?

There's one thing that's always bothered me about the Fermi paradox, and that is the idea that since we can't see evidence of colonization of intelligent species, then there must be some great filter that stops species like ours from proliferating throughout the galaxy.
It just feels so presumptuous.  Like we can't see very well beyond our own solar system.  Sure, we can see very bright things like stars, but we can't really "see" exoplanets.  We can detect them by how they interfere with a star's gravity and light but we can't see enough detail to know if they have life or not.  Heck, we have trouble doing that with planets, dwarf planets and moons in our own backyard.
Why couldn't there be a massive galaxy spanning civilization in the Milky Way?  What makes us so sure we'd be able to detect it now with our satellites and telescopes?  Is it possible they've simply overlooked us as being just another planet among a hundred billion other planets?  Or they see earth and don't want to mess with it, the way some conservationists on Earth try to save patches of wilderness?  Maybe they don't communicate in radio waves, if they somehow travel FTL, then they'd have to communicate FTL and that would exclude radio wave communication.  They could view radio waves as we view homing pigeons.  Even if they don't travel FTL and colonize using generational starships, maybe they still have moved on from radio waves.
Is there any reason to support the Fermi Paradox?  To me it seems we simply don't know enough about our own galaxy to even start making such claims right now.
