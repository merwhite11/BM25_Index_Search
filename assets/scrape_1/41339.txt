make a celestial map from deep sky images

I take pictures of deep sky objects and I would like to make a celestial map that contains the pictures in the right position in the sky.
Ideally something like stellarium. (but in stellarium it's hard and you have generated stars on top of the pictures).
it would be nice to have automatic plate solving, but otherwise I can try to use an external plate solver and provide to software/library directly the fits file. The method should accept colored images, I see many software that handle only gray fits files.
In other words a 3D black sphere where the pictures are automatically positioned, and the possibility to render a part of the 3D map or the entire map, or navigate like in stellarium.
I prefer linux software or python3 scripts/libraries.
Thanks!
