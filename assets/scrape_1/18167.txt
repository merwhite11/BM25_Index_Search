Signal-to-noise in inverse angstrom for spectroscopy?

In a paper I came across the description of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for observations with a spectograph. This was reported as $10\:1/\mathring{A}$. I am rather new to spectroscopy, so could someone clarify these units for me? Why is it used and how should I read it?
