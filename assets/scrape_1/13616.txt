Is there any support for the Big Crunch Theory? Could there have been a partial Big Crunch in the past?


Is there proof in either the CMB or other observed astronomical phenomena for Big Crunch?
Could there have been a partial Big Crunch maybe like a cluster of Black Holes colluding to create a disappearing zone in the Universe?
