How is spectroscopy used to deduce what an object is made of?

Spectroscopy is an analysis of light (or other EM wavelengths) that is often used by scientists to examine what an object is made from or contains.
Apologies if this is a stupid question, but this sounds effectively like saying “this thing is absorbing this wavelength or colour, therefore it is this substance”.
I’m confused as to how this works in practice. As a familliar example: light bouncing off leaves in summer can be a completely different colour to leaves in winter. Water when frozen looks to be a different colour to when it is liquid. Copper is shiny brownish unless it gets a bit rusty, then it’s bright green, etc etc.
Is it possible to explain how we can say with any amount of certainty that a given set of dips in EM wavelengths translates into identification of substances?
