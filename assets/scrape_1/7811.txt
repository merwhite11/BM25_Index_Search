Why does this graph for sunlight intensity on land has a steeper slope during sunrise as compared to sunset?

I got this image while checking weather data for a city in North India using  Mathematica's Wolfram Alpha query 

I noticed one feature in the graph which i could not explain .
Why does the encircled part 'A' which denotes  sunrise has slightly higher slope as compared to encircled part 'B' which denotes sunset ! 
I also checked the graph for summer month and the pattern was exactly opposite 
Summer Month 

Am i interpreting the data wrong or is it so that sun achieves its highest intensity during the day faster in winter months than in summers ? What could be the reason behind this ?
