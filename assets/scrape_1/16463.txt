What may be the period and speed of revolution of the star that is closes to galactic centre?

The Sun moves at the speed of 220km/s around the galactic center in a circular orbit. The sun is located at about 30,000 light years from the galactic center. The Sun orbits around the center of the Milky Way once every 225 million years. The period of time is called a cosmic year.
I am curious about the speed at which the star closest to galactic center revolves around galactic center. Has this been calculated or approximated. Also what is the time it takes to complete one revolution for the star around galactic center or what is the cosmic year length for the star that is closest to galactic Center .
