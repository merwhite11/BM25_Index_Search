What is the most oblate astronomical object known?

There are some very vast spinning objects out there.   How high can the eccentricity get, or, which I think is easier to understand, how small can the ratio between the polar and equatorial diameter be?
For clarification, I'm asking about objects composed composed of particles (not some boundary or field etc) and that are devoid of non-microscopic empty spaces. I.e. a planet or star etc; not a galaxy or rings or a heliosphere etc. 
For the purpose of this question, I just don't find galaxies or nebulae interesting because they can have almost any shape.
I'm talking about structures that are oblate spheroids essentially.
