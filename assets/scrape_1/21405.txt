An hypothetical timepiece on board of a spaceship. Please Help

On board of a hypothetical spaceship, I have a hypothetical clock consisting of 2 mirrors and a light beam is being reflected between the mirrors to measure the time. Now if we hypothetically exceed the speed of light; what will I see is happening to my clock on board of my ship? (a) Light can't exceed the speed of light so according to me the clock has freezed, (b) Light always passes the observer at the speed of light, so my clock is keeping perfectly time but the speed of light inside my clock has surpassed the speed of light? (c) The clock will run backwards?  I just can't wrap my mind around this problem.
