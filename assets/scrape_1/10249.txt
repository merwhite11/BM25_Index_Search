Average number of exoplanets in a system

I was just wondering what is the normal amount of planets is in a star system, because in my mind 8 planets seems like a relatively large amount. So are we above average? Can we even see all the exoplanets in a star system? Also, do we know if belts of asteroids are common? Is it even likely for a star to have planets?
