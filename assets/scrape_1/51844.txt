Search good image for observable sky as seen from earth

I am searching for a good image that explains the field of view as seen from a certain latitude. Example: an observer standing on earth has limited view due to the horizon. Furthermore, he sees all stars in 23,56 hrs. (not all visible due to sun..)
I am searching and searching but can not find an easy image with our earth, a field of view (cone) the whole sky, and the observable sky.
Maybe someone of you has such an image. Would really appreciate this !!
