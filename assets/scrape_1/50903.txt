What is the mass of exoplanet HD 100546b?

What is HD 100546b's real mass?
In Wikipedia I found that its mass is 3.1 Jupiter's masses but at Nasa official site I found that it was 752 Jupiter masses, which sounds unbelievable.
And on the Internet, there are many different masses. If someone can also give a resource, it would be most welcome.
