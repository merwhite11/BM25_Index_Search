Do galaxies have a preferred orientation?

This article: http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/jul/25/was-the-universe-born-spinning asserts that the universe was "born spinning" and that there is a preferred rotation direction for galaxies in the universe.  My question is whether there is a preferred galaxy orientation in the universe, that is, whether there is a preferred plane for the galaxy disk?
