Where is the center point for the Supergalactic coordinate system?

I'm trying to build a 3D visualization of the Supergalactic coordinate system and couldn't find any reference to where the center point should be (the Sun, galactic center, the Earth, etc). 
Also I already tried to look into some articles and books, but they only refer to the zero point related to the galactic coordinates.
Where should it be?
Could I use this model as the reference for the Supergalactic Coordinate system, starting to count the SGL (L) and SGB (B) from the yellow line?
It is still unclear to me if (l=137.37 b=0) indicates just the direction of the center of the Supergalactic Coordinates System.
Note: The Sun is being used as the center point.

Plano Galactico translates into Galactic Plane.
Centro Galactico translates into Galactic Center.
