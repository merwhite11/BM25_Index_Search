What causes fast moving pulsars to move so fast?

This article investigates the traces left in the ISM by fast moving pulsars. Is there a mechanism specific to pulsars that causes them to move so fast, or are there just as many fast moving stars?
The article also mentions that 

Many fast moving pulsars quickly escape  the  host  supernova  remnant 

This seems to indicate that something during the supernova makes the pulsar speed-up (or the remnant slow down). How does this happen?
