Is it possible that the Sun and all the nearby stars formed from the same nebula?

I was looking at a map of our local stellar neighborhood, and it occured to me, the stars are really close, if one compares them to the size of some nebulae. So can it be, that the Sun, Alpha Centauri system, and all the other stars in the neighborhood actually formed from the same nebula? Have we discovered any information about this?
