How can astrophysicists discriminate between pp-chain solar neutrinos and CNO-cycle ones?

Astrophysicists at the Borexino experiment in Italy have recently claimed that they have detected CNO-cycle neutrinos coming from the Sun.
It was the Cover story for the November 26 issue of Nature.
I read the whole Paper, and accompanying editorial, yet unless I missed something, they do not say what makes a CNO-neutrino different from an ordinary pp-neutrino.
They go to great lengths to describe how they excluded all types of background noise, but did not say whether CNO-neutrinos are higher or lower in energy than 'proton-proton chain' neutrinos....
Presumably, CNO neutrinos are higher in energy than pp ones?  How many eV or keV?
