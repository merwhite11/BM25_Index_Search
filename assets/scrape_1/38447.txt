For what parameter does the abbreviation MA stand for?

In the sentence:
"We added a Keplerian model with P = 120.713 days, m = 14.629M⊕, e = 0.0448, ω = 251.36°, and MA=216.88° plus Gaussian noise with rms=5.9696 ms-1."

P is the orbital period, e the eccentricity,... But what is MA? I'm guessing its the mean anomaly, but the mean anomaly is a time-dependent variable which (for my understanding) does not make sense in this context...
