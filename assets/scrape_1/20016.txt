Average effect of a planet on a comet

I'm considering a problem involving star S, planet A, and a comet B. The orbits of the planet and comet are eccentric, with eccentricities $e_A$ and $e_B$. I'm trying to calculate the average change in position that A should cause in B. I'm assuming $M_A \gg M_B$, so B should have negligible effect on A.
If I start using a coordinate system and assume S is at the origin, and A and B have semimajor axes $a_A$ and $a_B$ then A's orbit has polar equation $$r_A(\alpha) = \frac{a_A(1-e_A^2)}{1 - e_A\cos(\alpha)}$$
And if the angle between the major axes of A and B (the axes connecting their foci) at S is $\theta$ then B's orbit has polar equation $$r_B(\beta) = \frac{a_B(1-e_B^2)}{1 - e_B\cos(\beta-\theta)}$$
Thanks to Newton I know that the acceleration on B toward A is given by $$\text{acc}(\alpha, \beta) := \frac{GM_A (\vec{x}_A(\alpha) - \vec{x}_B(\beta))}{\mid\mid\vec{x}_A(\alpha) - \vec{x}_B(\beta)\mid\mid^3}$$ where $\vec{x}_P(\phi)$ is my shorthand for the position of object P, $(r_P(\phi), \phi)$.
My initial thought was the position change is given by $$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\text{acc}(\alpha, \beta) \; \mathrm{d}\alpha  \; \mathrm{d}\beta$$ and so the average position change would be $$\frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\text{acc}(\alpha, \beta) \; \mathrm{d}\alpha  \; \mathrm{d}\beta$$ however a colleague suggested that this assumes that the distribution of A and B in their orbits is uniform, which it isn't. So I did some calculations and worked out that object P has probability distribution $$\mu_{P}(\theta) = \frac{(1 - e_{P}^{2})^{3/2}}{2\pi (1-e\cos(\theta))^2}.$$
Armed with this knowledge I now think that the average effect of A on B is the change in position given by $$\frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\text{acc}(\alpha, \beta)\mu_A(\alpha)\mu_B(\beta) \; \mathrm{d}\alpha  \; \mathrm{d}\beta.$$
That said I'm not sure if I'm missing anything or if my whole approach is off, and so I thought I'd ask here if my reasoning and ultimately my concluding integral seem correct. I'm a pure mathematician so I'm not very comfortable sorting out whether an application of theory has been properly applied to a real world situation. Any input is most welcome.
