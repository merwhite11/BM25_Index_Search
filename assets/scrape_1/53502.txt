If Sagittarius A* were used as a compass, where would its points be?

I know a galactic co-ordinate system exists already, but it's dependent on the position of Earth. What if Sagittarius A* itself were used as the centre of a compass? What objects would best define its North (opposite direction of Earth), East, and West points, as well as up and down? I know "Elnath" is normally used to define the anticentre, AKA South (I think?).
