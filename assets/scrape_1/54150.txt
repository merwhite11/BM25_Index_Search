Could macroscopic primordial black holes have created metals shortly after the big bang?

After seeing articles about the jwst like these two: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2023/02/astronomers-discover-metal-rich-galaxies-early-universe
https://www.livescience.com/james-webb-space-telescope-discovers-oldest-black-hole-in-the-universe-a-cosmic-monster-ten-million-times-heavier-than-the-sun
And some older articles like this one:
https://www.salon.com/2021/11/18/gold-black-holes/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20new%20paper,occur%2C%20which%20creates%20heavy%20metals.
I thought: "Wouldn't the birth of primordial supermassive black holes during the big bang create a bunch of heavier elements as it ate and fling them all over the place?"
(Even if I'm completely wrong, I'd like to see an astrophysics guru tear my hypothesis to shreds! :)
-edit-
ProfRob, thank you for your comment.
Also, thank you Arjun.
Both of your input helped me better form my question.
If the density was sufficient enough early enough in the process of the big bang to form a macroscopic black hole, then it may also have had sufficient mass and enough surrounding dense gasses to form a metal producing accretion disk.
I guess the question then becomes: "How early in the big bang process could a black hole accretion disk have formed? Also, could such an accretion disk in that environment be capable of forming heavier elements from the hydrogen and helium surrounding it?"
