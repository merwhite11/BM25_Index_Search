How is a Planet's Moment of Inertia Measured Remotely?

In the July 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope there is an article titled Sights Set on Uranus.  In that article the following statement is made:

Since the 1930's we've suspected that Uranus and Neptune are made
mostly of ice. (Ice refers to materials that are typically liquids or
gases on Earth but are frozen in the outer solar system, including
water and other lightweight molecular compounds like methane and
ammonia.) But that time, astronomers had measured each planet's mass,
volume, and moment of inertia, a measure of how concentrated the
mass is towards the planet's center.

I can easily imagine how one would estimate the mass and volume of a planet remotely in the 1930s, but how was the moment of inertia estimated?  I would have thought this would have required an orbiter or a fly-by to measure the shape of the gravitational potential.

Information below is more background information that I was able to dig up:
Wildt, R., 1939. The Constitution of the Planets. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 81(2), pp.135-152.

The greatest moment of inertia, $C$, of a planet can be computed
from its oblateness on the Radau-Darwin theory of the
ellipticity of the> Earth.*  For a homogeneous body
the dimensionless quantity, $C/Ma^2$, has the maximum value,
2/5. The values of $C/Ma^2$ given in Table I for the
terrestrial planets have been taken from H. Jeffreys $\dagger$;
they correspond to his models of these bodies which will be
discussed in Section II. The other values have been calculated
from the dynamical ellipticities of the giant planets
determined by N. Lvoff.$\ddagger$ Since the deviations of the
individual values from Lvoffâ€™s mean, 0.24, are not well
established at present, only this mean will be used in the
further discussions; but there is evidence that the quantity
$C/Ma^2$ is decidedly less for Saturn than for Jupiter.

Note: $C$ - greatest moment of inertia; $M$ - mass, unit 5.966x1027 g; $a$ - equatorial radius, unit 6278.388 km
