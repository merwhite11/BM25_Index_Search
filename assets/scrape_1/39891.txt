If suddenly "knocked" or perturbed from its orbit, would gravity eventually return the Earth to its original orbit?

If suddenly "knocked" or perturbed from its orbit, would gravity eventually return the Earth to its original orbit?
I am curious as to whether this is even possible.
It seems to me that since the orbit is based on gravity, the same gravity will pull it back to correct orbit eventually. Is this reasoning right?
