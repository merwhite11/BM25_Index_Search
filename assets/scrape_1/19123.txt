Relative black hole?

When some object is moving, it appears smaller and more massive. What if it's moving so fast it should become a black hole? Some calculations:
Let observed radius $R_0\gamma$ ($R_0$ - radius at rest) be equal Schwarzschild radius for object with observed mass $M_0\gamma$ ($M_0$ - mass at rest):
$$R_0 / \gamma = \frac{2GM_0\gamma}{c^2}$$
$$\gamma^2=\frac{R_0c^2}{2GM_0}$$
$$\frac{v}{c}=\sqrt{1-\frac{2GM_0}{R_0c^2}}$$
For Earth it gives $v=0.999999999304c$ and for Sun $v=0.999997877903c$. Is my reasoning correct? How would we see such objects?
