Can insolation affect stars?

Stars glow with (almost) a black body spectrum. The fourth-power dependency on temperature means that there are large differences in surface brightness between hotter and cooler stars.
The coolest stars are about 2000K while the hottest exceed 10000K, which represents a 625-fold difference in surface brightness.
Consider a 2000K red dwarf star in orbit around a 10000K blue giant at a distance of 10 blue-giant radii away. This is far enough that tidal effects are mild for both stars (tidal heating can be avoided if they are tidally locked).
The substellar point of the red dwarf will absorb about 6 times more energy than it radiates. Would this radiation heat the dwarf star and cause it to expand? If so could the core decompress and adiabatically cool, stopping fusion?
