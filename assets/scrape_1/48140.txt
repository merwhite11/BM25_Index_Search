Brown Dwarf Sun: How dim can a star be in the visible spectrum and still provide enough heat for a planet to be habitable?

After reading this question on wordbuilding. I saw that a brown dwarf emits most of its energy in the infrared which made me wonder: How bright would such a star appear from it's exoplanet in the visible light range? Could an exoplanet orbit a brown dwarf and be warm enough for life with liquid water and a similar temperature to Earth, yet be cast into eternal night?
