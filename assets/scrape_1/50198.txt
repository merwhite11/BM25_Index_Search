Simbad, NED databases surface magnitude data?

I can't seem to find data about surface magnitude of galaxies in Simbad.
I can easily find the apparent and absolute magnitude ...
Should I just try to compute the surface magnitude, given the apparent magnitude, and galaxy diameter (arc sec)?
Do you know how to find surface mag in Simbad, or NED , Vizier?
Will this give a reasonable estimate?:
SurfaceB = m + 2.5 * log10(AngularArea)

Aproximate Angular Area:
AngularArea = pi * (galaxyDiameter/2)^2
