If a supernova explodes all it's comets into space, can they reach a big number of star systems?

If there's DNA life that arises on a warm planet 2 billion years after the big bang, and meteorite collisions on the planet propagate DNA unicellular organisms into millions of icy rocks orbiting the star until it goes into supernova mode...
When a supernova happens does it accelerate millions of rocks into a collision course with nearly all the cloud formations and star systems of the galaxy? Would the rocks vaporize and have a limited dispersion?
