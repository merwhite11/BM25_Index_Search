Is it possible to make (or buy kit) DIY portable radio telescope that I can place on the balcony like optical telescope?

I want to have a small radio telescope to use on balcony instead of optical when sky is cloudy (it is very often).
Is it possible? What objects can be observed by that telescope? Is it possible to use 2D matrix as receiver like an astrocamera in optical telescope (to observe a sky field like optical telescopes, not a single point)?
