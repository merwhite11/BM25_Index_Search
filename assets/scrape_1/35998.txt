Which telescope would be better with a DSLR?

I'm interested in astrophotography and since I haven't left my home in six weeks, my interest in photographing the skies has been growing. I'm on a tight budget and I've found these two options:

A Meade Infinity 70mm (f/10), a cheap refractor.
The Omegon Maksutov MightyMak 80mm, only for 20â‚¬ more. 

The Meade has a T2 mount, the Omegon uses 1.25" but comes with a T2 adapter; meaning in both cases I'd need the T2 to Canon adapter. 
I would also like to be able to use it for terrestrial photography once the lockdown is over, and that's a big factor in my case, even if the results are not excellent. I know that for astro the mount is extremely important, but I'm not thinking about deep sky, mostly planets and the Moon and, of course, terrestrial.
In most forums they always talk about expensive options, but these cheap ones are not often discussed for obvious reason.
