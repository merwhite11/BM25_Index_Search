Why do years become shorter with time?

I've read (in Gates to the Hebrew calendar p.128   and other sources) that the Earth orbits the Sun in 365.256 days, but each 1000 years the year becomes shorter by 5.5 seconds. 

"The accurate length of the year is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45.216 seconds. However this time is going and becoming shorter by 5.5 seconds each 1000 years.

Does this mean that in 10000 years it'll become shorter by 55 seconds, and in 100 years it'll become shorter by 9.16 minutes? What's the explanation for the year shortening with time?  
[N.b. I've not read the first book mentioned above and the cite is a translation was presented by a lecturer from which I took notes. Therefore, it could be that the original book contains the explanation. I have no way to check it and that's why I'm seeking here the explanation].
