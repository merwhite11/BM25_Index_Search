Why do the Pleiades look clearer when viewed indirectly?

I've noticed that the Pleiades look bright in the sky, but when I look directly at the constellation, it suddenly goes dim and it's more difficult to make out the individual stars. 
Why does this happen, and is there a way to "beat the system" by both being able to look directly at a star and see it clearly.
