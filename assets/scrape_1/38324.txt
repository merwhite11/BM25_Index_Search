Events I cannot explain

In the last few days I experienced two events I cannot explain. I watch the sky since I was a child so I'm aware of most events like satellites, ISS, Iridium flares, etc...
First event
It was about 22:30 local time and I was located in the central Italy. I was looking in the nearby of Hercules and Corona Borealis when some degrees at left of Arturo (say near M5) a white light flashed shortly. The flash was very short, I think below 150 ms without any fade. Because it was so short I cannot say if it was moving or not, but the other strange thing is it's apparent diameter. It was larger than any other star or planet and without any difference of luminosity between the center and the border. I mean, it was like a small disk with a matte surface and a uniform white light. I can estimate it's magnitude about -2 (slightly less Jupiter in these days). It was not like an Iridium flare at all.
Second event
Yesteday, norther Italy, 1:30 AM local time. I saw what looked like a very bright satellite in SW/NE orbit. But there were few strange things:

as far as I know, it was too late for any satellite to be illuminated by the sun for such a bright magnitude. It was as bright as Venus at its maximum brightness (I would say at least -3.5).

it was composed of two distinct lights, very close together. At first I thought it was a plane from the nearby airport with landing lights still on after takeoff, but I know them and this was different. Furthermore there were no red/green lights nor strobo. And the lights were too close for a a plane below 10000 feet. Then they didn't change their brightness across the sky, like landing lights do.

it moved across the sky like the ISS does, and just few degrees from my zenith it disappeared instantly without any fading.


Any idea of what they might be?
