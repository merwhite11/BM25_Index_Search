Shouldn't very very distant objects appear magnified?

My understanding of the expansion of space itself is very shaky,
but if space itself is expanding,
then shouldn't very very distant objects appear magnified?
For example these James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) galaxies from like the year 400M.
Perhaps the distance at which that effect would become noticeable is past the observable horizon.
I guess a related question would be What was the scale of space back then compared to now?
