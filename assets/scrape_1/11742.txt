Travelling at light speed(inside water)

It is a said fact that 299792458 m/s is the speed limit,nothing can go faster than this speed, or it will take an infinite amount of energy for propulsion.What we perforce in vacuum is one thing.Can someone explain what will be observed(from the particle's frame and an observer frame at rest) if a particle of a non zero test mass moves at light speed inside a non vacuum medium(say water) as this velocity is definitely lesser than the limit.
THANKS IN ADVANCE
