Was Theia a planet or an asteroid?

According to an article Theia (from the Giant impact hypothesis) was an asteroid and according to The Wikipedia article about Theia Theia was an Earth trojan (which is an asteroid). Which is dubious, so why it is  dubious?. It feels very clear to me that Theia was a planet since it was 0.40 the Earth's mass, according to this ScienceDirect article.
In the Wikipedia article clicking the dubious - discuss hyperlink, someone said that Theia should be an asteroid since it has not cleared it's neighborhood  according to IAU's 3rd rule. But why couldn't it have cleared it's neighborhood, being 0.40 M⊕ / Earth's Mass while Mercury is only 0.055 M⊕ ?
