Will there be a five planet conjunction in March, 2022?

"Five stars rise in the East" arm protector is a Chinese relic. This article says that "researchers from the Japanese observatory said the next alignment of the five planets to the east will not be until March 21, 2022," but looking at many site I can't find any such 5 planet conjunctions on that date, let alone in the East.
UPDATE
Following the great answer given, could I please expand the question: Are 5 planet conjunctions like this rare? What constellation(s) are the 5 planets in during their conjunction? How long will the conjunction last? How far up in the sky does a person in Hong Kong have to look to see the conjunction, in laymen's terms? How far above the horizon?
