How to Interpret Lomb Scargle periodogram

lomb scargle periodogram:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from scipy import signal
from astropy.time import Time
from astropy.timeseries import LombScargle

m5_data = pd.read_csv('tmp')
m5_data.head()

     date    sales
0  2011-01-29  32631.0
1  2011-01-30  31749.0
2  2011-01-31  23783.0
3  2011-02-01  25412.0
4  2011-02-02  19146.0

"""Converting dates to MJD """
tmp_str = m5_data.iloc[:,0].astype(pd.StringDtype())
t_date = np.array(tmp_str.values,dtype = 'str')
t_date = Time(t_date, format='isot', scale='utc')
t_date.format = 'mjd'

y = m5_data.iloc[:,1]
m5_ls = LombScargle(t_date, y)
m5_frequency, m5_power = m5_ls.autopower()
plt.plot(m5_frequency,m5_power)
plt.show()


What does the x axis represent? Is it frequencies in days or is it frequencies in 1/day?
So the spike at 2 does that mean there is a period of every two days or does it mean there is a period 1/2 days, which is a fractional day and I do not understand how I could get fractional days when I only have 1 observation per day.

The overall goal is to find if the data is periodic. Given this data is sales of a product from a store I would expect that if the data is periodic that the periods would be 7days(weekly), 30days(monthly), 182days(semi annually)
So the spike at 2 does not make sense to me.
