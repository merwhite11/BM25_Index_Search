Sun's apparent magnitude at 2.5 AU?

Imagine an astronaut standing on an asteroid 2.5 A.U. distant from the Sun. He is gazing, naked-eye, towards the Sun.

What is the apparent magnitude of the Sun at that distance, and is that bright enough to blot out any of the inner planets? No light blockers and solely viewing with the Eyeball Mark I?
