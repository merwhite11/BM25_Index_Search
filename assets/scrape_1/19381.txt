Which stars, identifiable with the naked eye, have exoplanets?

If I look at the night sky, which easily identifiable stars have known exoplanets, and what are the names of those planets?
With the recent discovery of so many exoplanets, it is a nice idea to look at the stars with this new knowledge. They will no longer seem like a bunch of anonymous white dots.
