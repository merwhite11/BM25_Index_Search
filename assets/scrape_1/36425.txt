Historical lunar occultation of Venus seen from Sicily in the winter?

I am looking for dates in history, from 400 years ago or older, when there was an occultation of Venus by the Moon during Winter as seen from Sicily.  Venus was rising, and according to the text that I am trying to fact check, it is not clear what phase the moon is in. The text from Shakespeare reads there were "nine changes to the watery star"  This is interpreted to mean the moon, as it effects the tides.  So the moon should be 9 days away from a full moon.
Or if an occultation is too rare would there be an appulse that matches the criteria?  
1) Venus is rising.
2) The moon is waning nine days.
3) As seen from Sicily.  
I am led to understand that this is a rare event, happening once every 200 years or more, and I would be curious to know about any other unusual astronomical events that occurred within +/- 23 or 24 years of this rare event. 
Where could I find this information?  Is there a star chart I could check?
