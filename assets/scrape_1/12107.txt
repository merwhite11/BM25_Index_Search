Questions about terminology used for Mars and its moons

I am having difficulty with some terminology:

sub-Martian hemisphere of Deimos ... what place on Deimos does it refer to?
leading/trailing apex of Phobos ... what place are those?
Apex ... in general it means a top of something, or an end of something pointed; but what does it mean on a relatively spherical body?
Anti-Mars meridian ... is this a meridian on the side of the moon facing away from Mars?

Thank you.
