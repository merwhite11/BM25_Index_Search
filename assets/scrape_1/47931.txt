Why was the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) released at a blackbody temperature of 3000K rather than 30,000K?

If the ionization (or reionization, or Recombination) energy of atomic hydrogen is 13.6 EV, which corresponds to a black body temperature of 30,000K, why did the CMB not begin to appear then?
Why did the universe wait until it had cooled down to 3,000K to release the Relic Radiation (the CMB)?
I may have found a clue on Quora:  How is Hubble Constant calculated from Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation measurements?
The redshift is known quite precisely from the theory, since a hot big bang model (the standard model of cosmology) predicts the point at which the plasma de-ionized to form neutral hydrogen. Roughly, this is when the universe cooled to a temperature below the binding energy of hydrogen,  13.6eV/kb .

The redshift is known quite precisely from the theory, since a hot big
bang model (the standard model of cosmology) predicts the point at
which the plasma de-ionized to form neutral hydrogen. Roughly, this is
when the universe cooled to a temperature below the binding energy of
hydrogen, $13.6\frac{eV}{k_b}$.
To answer the titular question, the hubble constant is determined
through obtaining the angular diameter distance to the last scattering
surface. That's not a direct observable; instead you infer it through
trigonometry. We can directly measure the angular scale of the Baryon
Acoustic oscillations in the CMB--it's the distance between troughs in
the power spectrum shown in Leo C. Stein's answer. In the standard
$\lambda$CDM
cosmological model, we also know* the physical scale of the BAO
feature, known as the sound horizon length. The angular diameter
distance is then defined as
$D_A=\frac{r_s}{\theta_s}$
where the numerator is the known physical scale and the bottom is the
measured angular scale (this is just basic trig). The angular diameter
distance is a well-known function of the hubble rate, and you can
infer the hubble rate from getting the angular diameter distance
(assuming the only pertinent species of particles in the universe are
dark matter, baryons, photons, neutrinos, and the cosmological
constant).

Doesn't dividing 13.6 eV by a number much smaller than 1 give an enormously large number, not a lower one?
I am confused...
