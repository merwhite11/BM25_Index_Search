How much solid matter is in the observable Universe?

I want to know the volumetric ratio of empty space to planets, stars, and all other solid matter combined. Not considering any dark matter, dark energy, or black holes.
For example, you can say X percent of the observable space is just empty space. The remainings are comets, stars, planets, and so on.
Edit:

I meant solid as in all the things that are not gas.
I know that space is not exactly empty, let's consider that empty means all other things except solid.
I'm not looking for exact numbers but just an estimation.
