Does a measuring stick with a size of a billion lightyears in intergalactic space keep the same length in expanding space?

Imagine a measuring stick (a rod or ruler) made of ordinary matter which has a length of a billion lightyears. The space surrounding the ruler expands. Will the ruler keep the same length by the accumulating electromagnetic forces opposing expansion? Or will expansion tear the ruler apart?
I have read somewhere here, in an accepted answer (I have no intention exposing the answer so you have to trust me on this) that the ruler expands along but I have my doubts. Will it not oppose expansion like the gravity of galaxies in a cluster opposes expansion?
