What would happen if a person was out in space? would they get picked up by the pull of gravity from inbetween our planets, or sun?

I'm curious, if someone were to be floating out in space. Would they eventually be captured by the gravitational pull from another planet or sun. To be more specific the person isn't anywhere near said planet or sun they are just passing between them. My question, is there some sort of current in between planets or sun that can have the slightest effect on an object passing through?
