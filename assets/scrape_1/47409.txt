Could there be planets that are not rotating around their axis yet are in orbit around a star?

The title really says it all.
I know that there are planets like Earth that rotate around their axis and also around their star. I know that there are tidally locked planets which always have the same side turned towards their star. And, of course, there are rogue planets that don't orbit a star at all.
But what about a scenario where a planet is in a stable orbit around a star, yet does not revolve around its own axis? From the point of view of someone on the planet, all the stars stay almost unmoving in the sky, but the sun seems to slowly orbit the planet. Half a year there is light, and half a year there is darkness.
Is this realistic? Or would such a planet start rotating around its axis anyway due to whatever forces?
