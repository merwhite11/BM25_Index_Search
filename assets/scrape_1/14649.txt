Why are certain elements so common?

I understand why hydrogen and helium are the most common elements in the universe. I also understand iron, because that's where stellar fusion stops. But why are (specifically) oxygen, carbon and neon more common than iron? I would expect iron to either outrank them, or some steady flow of atomic nnumbers to lead up to iron. These three, and the scattershot of seemingly random elements trailing behind iron, seem a very odd mix!
