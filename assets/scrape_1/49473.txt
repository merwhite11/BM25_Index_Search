Why would a meteor shower have 2 areas of origination and 2 directions of travel?

I watched for the herculid shower last night and saw several. There were 2 general areas of activity in the sky. I would place them at 11 o'clock and 2 o'clock with 12 directly over head. 1/2 the streaks traveled south to north and 1/2 west to east. Both areas of origination had streaks in both directions. This is not what I expected. How does this happen?
