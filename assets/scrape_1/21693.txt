How accurate are NASA's eclipse predictions?

NASA's predictions for the August 2017 solar eclipse show that about half of Kansas City will see a total eclipse and the other half won't (they'll just see a "near" total eclipse, perhaps even Bailey's Beads?).
I thought this would be a great way of testing how accurate NASA's eclipse path prediction is: have people in Kansas City report, with location, whether they saw a total eclipse or not (of course, many people in Kansas City will probably head into the total eclipse zone just to see it, but hopefully few will remain outside it).
It then occurred to me that someone must've already done this for previous eclipses (I know it's done for lunar occultations of other stars).
However, googling only tells me that NASA's 2017 path predictions are more accurate than ever before, but not actually HOW accurate they are.
Where can I find data about accuracy of eclipse predictions?
