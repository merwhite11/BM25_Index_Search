How old is the idea of the far side of the Moon?

The far side of the Moon is the side which always faces away from the Earth, due to tidal locking. Due to libration, about 18% of this far side can be seen at one point or another through telescopes.
Culturally, there are many stories, some very old, about the near side of the Moon and its features, including the rabbit and the man in the moon and mythological moon beings.
Considering that the far side of the moon was only properly observed in the 1960s, how long ago did a human culture start forming an idea of the far side of the moon as a place? Was it when the first observations suggested that planetary bodies and the Earth were round? Was it earlier than that?
