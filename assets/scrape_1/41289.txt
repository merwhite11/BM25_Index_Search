Maritime telescopes: Stabilisation requirements for optical vs. radio telescopes?

SOFIA stands for Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy. She says:

My telescope stays stable with a spherical bearing, shock absorbers, and gyroscopes.

I suppose a similar system would work for an optical telescope on a maritime vessel as well. But what about a radio-telescope on a ship with a dish of around 10m? What are arguments (ideally mathematical ones) against a similar construction like for SOFIA?
