Is there a comprehensive catalog of all known black holes?

Is there a comprehensive catalog of all known black holes?
If "yes" - does it include the method of the black hole discovery and it's location in the Universe?
Are black holes, detected only by the capture of gravitational waves, generated due to their merge with another black hole or with neutron star, listed there?
See the example of naming in the quote below:
"Dr. Stefan Dreizler, an astronomer at the University of Göttingen and his colleagues analyzed data collected over two years with the MUSE instrument. The new data from the University of Warsaw’s Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope enabled the team to measure the mass of the black hole and confirm their findings. Named NGC 1850 BH1, the black hole is roughly 11 times as massive as our Sun."
