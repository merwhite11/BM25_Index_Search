How can I tell if my solar glasses are up to ISO standards?

Like many, we bought solar glasses to view the eclipse, and are now in a strange place where we can't tell if they're safe or not.  The big fuss seems to be about ISO 12312-2 compliance.  Apparently there are some glasses which are claiming to be certified and putting the logo in the glasses when they are, in fact, not up to spec.
Now the only "solution" that has been given is to buy from one of the "reputable" vendors documented by the AAS.  Many smaller vendors are crying foul, saying the big guys are just trying to push out competition.
So my question is this: if I had a pair of glasses, what would be the proper way of determining if they met ISO 12312-2 standards?  Is there supposed to be a way for a customer to trace their purchase back and verify that the company that made them at least has their paperwork in order? (A company that has their paperwork and is still counterfeiting anyway is a different challenge).
Obviously the astronomy community is interested in ensuring their products are safe.  How were they supposed to do that in the ideal circumstances?  If I can't confirm their certification as a small-time buyer, how would a large-scale buyer of, say, 100,000 glasses or viewers determine that the product they are buying is genuine before someone burns their eyeballs?  Surely when there are hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, there would be a process to demonstrate compliance.
EDIT: I am specifically looking for how one is supposed to verify these glasses without relying on a whitelist provided by a single group such as the AAS (other than perhaps the ISO community itself).  Surely there is a way to verify claims of ISO compliance without relying on the good intentions of a professional society.  Otherwise, what is the point of having certifications in the first place?
