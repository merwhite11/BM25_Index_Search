How do rogue planets orbit around stars in other planetary systems?

I got some interesting answers for What would happen if a rogue planet hit one of the planets in our Solar System? 
But I have seen some documentaries that state that rogue planets from other planetary systems (which are ejected from the planetary systems in which they formed) have become part of the other planetary systems and orbit around those new stars as planets.
For example, please check this link:

The latest research suggests that sometimes, these rogue, nomadic worlds can find a new home by being captured into orbit around other stars.

How is this possible? Stars' gravity can pull the rogue planet into them. How do rogue planets escape this and orbit around the new stars. This seems to be a bit mysterious.
