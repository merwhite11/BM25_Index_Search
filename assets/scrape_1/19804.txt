Is the total energy of the CMBR diminishing with time?

Is the total energy of the CMBR diminishing with time? Since it's existence the volume of the Universe (at least the visible part) has grown by a factor three, which is to say, the number of photons per unit volume is diminished by a factor 27. But the wavelength of these photons has grown by a much bigger factor. So you should think the total energy of all the CMBR photons has become less over time.
