What can the average Astronomy Enthusiast do to learn more

Maybe this sounds like a silly question (and hopefully is legitimate), but I will elaborate a little more.
I seem to love astronomy, every single thing about it, I find it brilliant, interesting, mysterious, insanely amazing and mind boggling.
There is only so many documentaries you can watch, read articles on the web etc before you start to see repetition.
I just wondered if there was some advice of what I could do to keep that interesting fire burning...because I absolutely love it!!
