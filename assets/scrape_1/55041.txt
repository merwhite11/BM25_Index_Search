For what period of time can planets be viewed from the North Pole as just being there?

I would like details on observations (since North Pole is not possible, approximately around the North Pole) which tell us for how long are planets visible from the North Pole?
I understand that during the 6 months of daylight, the sunlight would obscure the sight of other planets. Despite that for what time period (years, months or days) are planets visible from the North Pole?
And how is this time period justified?

 Hypothetical example: observations show that Jupiter is visible from the North Pole for 1 month in a year. I donâ€™t want the answer to be based on common logic calculating the period and saying that the observation should be this. Rather, the period as per actual observations, and then if necessary, justified by calculations.
