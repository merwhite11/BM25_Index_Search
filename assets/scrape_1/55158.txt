What was the life cycle of population III stars?

Is the life cycle of population III, II, and I roughly the same, save in timescale? Did III go through the same phases, or equivalents of them, for instance, was their an equivalent "main sequence" phase for population III stars, and a "giant" or "supergiant" phase?
