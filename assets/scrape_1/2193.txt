A good telescope for the viewing of Nebulae, Stars and Planets

So, I am a 15 year old interested in astronomy. My father used to have a reflector telescope, but was never so serious about it that he could recommend me a good telescope. I am looking to buy a telescope up to £400 (possibly £500) and would like one that is mainly great for looking at nebulae. Stars and Planets would be great also, but are not necessary. Light Pollution isn't too bad. I have been recommended a Newtonian Reflector, but am not too sure if this would be suitable for my conditions. Also, does anyone recommend a good, British website where I could buy such a scope from? Finally, is there much point in me buying a computerized scope, will this allow me to align the scope better, or is it just going to be a waste of money.
