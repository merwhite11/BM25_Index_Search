Temporary family member 2020-CD3

So, recently I came to know that this asteroid is orbiting Earth from past 3 years and still it is orbiting. It is kind of a mini Moon to the Earth know to have come from asteroid-belt. 

Is there any threat of collision by 2020-CD3 on Earth and how long it will take to escape the Earth's gravity?
