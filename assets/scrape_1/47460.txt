Can stars really be seen after sunrise from Mount Everest?

I came across this image taken on the "Balcony" at over 27,000 ft (8,200 m) elevation, beneath the summit of Mount Everest. So many stars can be seen on it even though the Sun has risen. Do Everest climbers really see stars after sunrise or is the image a long-exposure one or something?
