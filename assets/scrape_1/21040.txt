Umbra, penumbra and antumbra

I'm trying to understand following schema of the wikipedia page here.

Image subtitle is "Umbra, penumbra, and antumbra, for a lunar eclipse".
Distances and sizes are not to scale. 
If distance Earth-Sun is about 150 Gm (gigameters) and Sun diameter is 1.4 Gm, $\arctan 1.4/150 = 0.57ยบ$ (degrees). Thus, the Sun is seen from Earth with an angle of approx. 0.57ยบ (0.01 radians). The Blue and red lines in schema should be near to parallel.
That means the point where umbra and antumbra touch is (being 12 Mm the approx diameter of Earth) at a distance of about $\frac{150}{1.4\times0.012}=1.3 \mathrm{Gm}$ from Earth. 
As distance Earth-Moon is only 0.400 Gm, it seems impossible that Moon was never in the antumbra zone of the Earth.
I'm doing a basic error somewhere, but I do not know where.
