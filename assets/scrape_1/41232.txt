Are there actual asteroids in the Oort cloud?

This answer to At what annual rate are new exoplanets being recognized? How does it compare to new asteroids? shows that the rate of new asteroid discovery is roughly two orders of magnitude higher than the rate of new exoplanet discovery, and once Vera C. Rubin comes online the disparity is likely to widen even further.
I quipped:

Thinking about the cross-over rate; at some point won't all the asteroids have been found?

there and then wondered if there is any distance limit to what is or isn't an asteroid, or are there new asteroids out there to discover all the way to the point where matter can no longer be gravitationally bound to the Sun because the pull of adjacent stars is just as strong.
Question: Are there asteroids per se in the Oort cloud, or for that matter, the Kuiper belt? Or are those basically considered comets? (trick question alert! see Do astronomers generally agree that the distinction between comets and asteroids is not so clear?)
Wikipedia sez the proposed Oort Cloud is full of icy planetesimals, and not being an astronomer I don't know how exactly to parse that.
