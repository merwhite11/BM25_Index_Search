How can we be 13.2 billion light years from another galaxy?

How did we get 13.2 billion light years from the faraway galaxies being discovered with Hubble?
If we all started near each other at the Big Bang, and we all travelled slower than the speed of light, and the universe is about 13.9 billion years old, how could we possibly be 13.2 billion light years away from recently discovered galaxies?
I know "inflation" was supposedly superluminal, but I bet no one thinks that matter dispersed several billion light years apart during that operation.
