Telescope's eyepieces got blurry over time

Right at the beginning: This is not a duplicate of questions involving blurry images through their eyepieces. I only get blurry images for 2 of my 3 eyepieces so it's not the telescope's fault and in the past, these eyepieces got me some pretty sharp images.
I possess a Celestron NexStar Evolution 8 SC-telescope and got the 2 included eyepieces (40mm and 13mm) and an Omegon Oberon 7mm 1.25" eyepiece. All the magnifications should be below the maximum useful magnification of the telescope. However, I noticed kinda blurry images for the 7mm and 13mm eyepieces; it seems as if I can't really get the images focused through them. The 40mm one works perfectly fine.
I know that when I got them (around a year ago), they weren't as blurry; I even found an image of a nearby spire I took last year with the 7mm eyepiece and I could clearly read the text written there. Today I tried looking at it again and I couldn't even make out any text; I can hardly focus enough to get somewhat sharp edges.
Temperature can only have a minor effect since I took the images last year at about the same time (and therefore similar ambient temperature).
I have no idea what could cause this, I really hope someone can help me because those blurry images are SO annoying!
