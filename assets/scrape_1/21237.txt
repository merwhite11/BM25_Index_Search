Which worlds have unique words for a "day"?

On Mars, we refer to a "day" as a "sol". NASA has developed a whole vocabulary around this term, like "yestersol" and "tosol", etc.
Do any other worlds have unique terms like this? How would one refer to a day on Venus, for example, or Mercury? Is "sol" used to avoid confusion with "day", like on Mars, or is "sol" an exclusively Martian term and "day" should be used for any other world until a unique term is agreed upon?
