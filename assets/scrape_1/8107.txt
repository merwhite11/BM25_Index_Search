Where can I find historic rates of meteor impact events?

I have a friend that watches a lot of TV news and they have the impression that impact events are becoming more common than in recent memory. Does the evidence support or refute this?
Thinking it would answer the question, I've tried to find data on the annual rate of impact events. But maybe there is another way to look at it.
