Looking for a Specific Planet

I know my title isn't the most specific, but the planet I am looking for is. I have been looking through many exoplanets and I can't seem to find what I am looking for, the closest I have found is TRAPPIST-1h. The issue is I do not believe that an anti-greenhouse effect could lower the temperature enough to make it suitable.
What I am looking for is a terrestrial planet, under six earth masses, at an equilibrium temperature of around ninety degrees Kelvin, and is within the Aquarius constellation. The star of the planet doesn't have to be visible to an earthbound audience, and the equilibrium temperature can be above or below ninety, as long as greenhouse or anti-greenhouse effects could theoretically make the surface temperature average ninety. A preference for the star it orbits to be a population II star, but that is not a requirement. Based on these parameters are there any planetary candidates?
