Do gamma rays escape from stars when turning into white dwarfs

I'm very curious about this : if the Sun were to become a white dwarf, would Earth get blasted with high-energy electromagnetic radiation? I know that current predictions say that Earth will be destroyed during the Sun's red giant phase, but if we assume it survived, would gamma rays rain down on Earth's surface?
My guess is that we would receive high-energy rays from the nuclear reactions still occuring inside the core, right before the star's explosion, but I'm not sure...
