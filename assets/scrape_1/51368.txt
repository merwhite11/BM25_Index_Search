Right ascension and declination visible at that local time and location

If I know the local time of an observer and her/his latitude and longitude, how can I know which stars are visible?
I'm developing a planetarium software using the Hipparcos Catalogue. I have also implemented all the formulas of the book: "Practical astronomy with your Calculator and Spreadsheet", but I don't know which to use.
I want to know which values of right ascension and declination are visible at that local time and location.
In other words, knowing the RA and DEC from the Hipparcos Catalogue, and knowing the latitude and longitude and the local time of the observer, there must be a formula (or formulas) to know which stars are visible at that moment.
