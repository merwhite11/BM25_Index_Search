Can a single location on earth witness solar eclipse totality 2 times during a single eclipse event?

The question came to my mind when I saw a visualisation of the path of the moon (relative to the sun - the sun is kept centered in the graphic, and only the moon moves) as its seen from a particular location during a solar eclipse.
This reddit post has the visualisation - https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/h0u878/in_10_days_there_will_be_a_partial_solar_eclipse/
In the visualisation, the moon appears to move towards the sun, and then retraces its path (almost).
If the moon crosses the sun, and then makes its way back, it is possible for the moon to cause 2 totality events at the same location on the earth.
Is this actually possible? Why or why not?
Has it even happened in the past? When and in which location?
When and where will it happen again?
