Help me identify an object

Can someone please help me identify the object moving from 'left' to 'right' in the 'upper' part of this video? (please forgive me for the artifact in the center of the video, dealing with FITS files is a new thing for me). It was recorded at 46.231694N, 27.6695E, between 20:18-22:30 UTC on 2023.06.26 (field of view ~2Â°). It's clearly not a LEO object, because of its speed (I suppose the longer, more instantaneous streaks are LEO satellites and the object I'm referring to is much slower). Likewise, it's probably not an asteroid because it was reported to MPC months ago and there was no feedback and if it is a NEO, other people would have seen it as well and reported it since then, I suppose. My theory is that maybe it's a Molniya or a GSO satellite, or possibly a satellite drifting towards its GEO slot? But these are pure guesses, any educated guess would be helpful. Thank you!
