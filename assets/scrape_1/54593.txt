When should we expect atmospheric info from the most promising planets for life, Trappist-1e?

It seems like other exoplanets in the Trappist-1 system have been studied by JWST but perhaps most promising planet for life, Trappist-1e, has yet to get studied or at least have any published news.
Is there any particular reason(s) 1e hasn't gotten studied, and is there any exact time we could expect a transit to be observed so we can get some information on the planet's atmosphere?
I understand position of JWST, orbital mechanics of Trappist-1, and competing projects all contribute to the answer but 1e seemed like something that would be prioritized over the other exoplanets in the system.
