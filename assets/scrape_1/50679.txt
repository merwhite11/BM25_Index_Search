Why would galaxies (and galaxy clusters) be unaffected by the expansion of space?

"Gravity holds galaxies and cluster of galaxies together, and they get farther away from each other--without themselves changing in size--as the universe expands."  Quoted from the OpenStax astronomy textbook. This assertion is commonly made, but without a convincing explanation.  After all, doesn't a large cluster occupy a significant chunk of (expanding) space?  Would it be because gravity is continually shrinking the size of both galaxies and clusters, and the expansion of space just slows this shrinking a bit?
