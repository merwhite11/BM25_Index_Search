Where is the habitable zone of a Hypergiant?


Where would an Earthlike planet need to be so it's still in the 'Habitable Zone' of a hypergiant Star, compared to the distance of the Earth from the sun?
Could complex life develop or survive on such a planet?

It's not necessary to answer the second question, as it is not really related to Astronomy much. But if someone could really answer that, I would be grateful.
Some background
I was watching this video of Kurzgesagt ( that's a YouTube channel.) which was released only some days ago, and the video spoke about the comparison of the Sun to some of the largest types of stars out there. The video also mentions Giants and of course, Hypergiants.
This made me think about what would happen if our very own Sun, turned into a Hypergiant.
