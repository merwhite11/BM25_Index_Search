What's different of power spectrum and correlation function of BAO?


(source)
There is the sentence "the harmonic sequence in the power spectrum correspond to a single peak in the correlation function and that the damping envelope corresponds to the broadening of this peak" in "Eisenstein et al. (2007) APJ_664_675".
Before, I misunderstood that the BAO peak in the correlation function has many peaks but other peaks are so small that we cannot see these except for  the 150Mpc peak.
But this paper states "a single peak in the correlation function", so I want to ask: Why are there many peaks in the power spectrum, but only a single peak in the correlation function?
