Moment of inertia factor of Venus and Pluto

Wikipedia's Moment of inertia factor begins:

In planetary sciences, the moment of inertia factor or normalized polar moment of inertia is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the radial distribution of mass inside a planet or satellite. Since a moment of inertia must have dimensions of mass times length squared, the moment of inertia factor is the coefficient that multiplies these.

The article lists values for 18 solar-system bodies including the Ceres and many moons.
But Venus and Pluto are conspicuously absent from this table.
What are the RI factor values for Venus and Pluto? Is there any source of reasonable calculation done for these two?

According to this note on the page Venus has a range of 0.327â€“0.342. Pluto is not mentioned anywhere.
