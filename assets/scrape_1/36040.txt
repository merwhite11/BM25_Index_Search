During solar eclipses on Jupiter, can the moon(s)' shadow(s) on the surface be seen from Earth with a telescope?

All of the Galilean moons are large and close enough to Jupiter that they can completely eclipse the sun and allow a solar eclipse to happen.
My question is can an observer from Earth, see the moon(s)' shadow(s) on the surface of Jupiter with a telescope or are the shadows too small?
