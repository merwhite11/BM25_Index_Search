Are there any binary red supergiants?

I wonder if we ever have identified or observed a pair of binary stars (red supergiants). And I also wonder what would happen if they exploded, (theoretically) as we havenâ€™t observed it. Also, would currently existing binary stars have enough mass to later on burn out into a red giant, and then explode as a supernova, and would it affect us?
