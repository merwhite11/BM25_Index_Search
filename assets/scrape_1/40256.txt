Why are these telescope mirror makers not upside down? (Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope)

The new open access Solar Physics article The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope – Observatory Overview is the first of several papers about the new state-of-the-art solar observatory. For more info see Phys.org's Solar telescope releases first image of a sunspot
Figure 4 of the paper is shown below. It is the 4 meter primary mirror viewed at an oblique angle with several people in clean room garb standing behind it.
We can see their reflections in the mirror as well. The geometry is similar to people standing on the opposite side of a reflecting pool.
What struck me is that this differs in an important way; the people are not upside down!

Why not exactly?
Would the people see the camera upside down then?

It looks like the photo was taken from fairly close to the mirror based on the strong perspective scaling from foreground to background objects.
