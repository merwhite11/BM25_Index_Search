Radial velocities - wings and core

Why are radial velocities measured at the core and at wings of a line profile? I mean interactive measurement -- comparing the direct and flipped images of the line profiles.
What is the difference of these radial velocities (I do not mean values)? For instance, why is it better to measure radial velocities of wings for H alpha emission line for Be stars? Does it make sense to measure RVs on a blue wing and a red wing? Or are radial velocities of a core measured for absorption lines and radial velocities of wings for emission lines?
