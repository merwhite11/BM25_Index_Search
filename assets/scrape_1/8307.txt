Can Jupiter's bands be made out using a 15x70 pair of binoculars?

I have been getting mixed opinions on this. I have a 15x70 Pair of Binoculars. I have tried staring at Jupiter for several minutes with it, I was able to see the Galilean moons, in fact the last time was so long that I noticed the Moon's position changing a little bit. 
But the glare of Jupiter is so high that I could not see the bands. Is it really possible to see any of Jupiter's bands using a 15x70 pair when the angular size is about 45 arcseconds ?
