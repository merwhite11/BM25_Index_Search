How to roughly calculate sunrise and sunset with a spreadsheet application

I am looking for a way to roughly calculate sunrise and sunset for a given lon/lat in mid Europe for each day of a year using a spreadsheet application. The thing doesn’t need to be very precise, but it should give a rough idea like when to switch on street lights—earlier in winter than in summer.
I have read various pages on that topic now, but they deal with the question in a more complicated (and surely, more precise) way than what I need. I have had such a spreadsheet in the past (which I did build myself), but I don’t have it anymore and the sources I used seem to have vanished from the internet.
What I want is to make a spread sheet with one row per day, where column
A = the date (here, input as spreadsheet date)
B = lon (W is negative, E is positive)
C = lat (S is negative, N is positive)
D = time zone (here, input as spreadsheet time)
What I needed is two formulas,
E = true noon
F = day length
so that I can get sunrise and sunset as
G = E - (F/2)
H = E + (F/2)
I think in the spreadsheet I once had, it took two sine calculations and some constants to get this done.

Please help me get this working again or to find the sources where it is explained.
