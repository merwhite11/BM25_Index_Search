If we watched extremely red-shifted galaxies near the edge of the observable universe for a very long time, how would they change? Would more appear?

I have understanding sphere eversion as #1 on my bucket list (if I ever get a round tuit) but understanding metric expansion seems to be a rapidly receding possibility :-)
Question: Suppose it takes me 100 million years to evert a sphere and I manage to live that long. If I watched extremely red-shifted galaxies near the edge of the observable universe for a very long time, how would their appearance change (aside from their own natural evolution)? Would their red shift z remain constant or increase/decrease? Would more of them appear?
If the radius observable universe is growing and by the rate and mechanisms described in the answer linked below, I'm thinking that at a given observing red-shifted wavelength new galaxies would appear farther away, and so the ones that were at the limit before must have somehow become less red-shifted.
This question was inspired by this answer to Does the mass of the observable universe ever change? but here I'd like to ask for supporting sources as that will allow me to read further. Thanks!

Would order 1AU metric expansion of space begin if the solar system were not inside a galaxy?
Is the metric expansion of space relatively uniform on different length scales?
How is a result of no time variation in the gravitational constant  related to a measurement of no local expansion?
