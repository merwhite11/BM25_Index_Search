accretion discs in h/lmxbs

High mass x-ray binaries necessarily accrete via wind, no disc accretion?
What makes the difference between a hmxb and a lmxb?
In what kind of circumstances does an accretion disc form?
How does it form?
When do we think there is a disc?
There is a clear cut between disc and wind accretion?
