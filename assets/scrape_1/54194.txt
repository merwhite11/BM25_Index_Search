Where to find data about as many stars as possible?

I need computer-readable data about as many stars as possible, with their:

distance to the Earth (or Sun),
their masses,

and if possible:

coordinates,
age,
brightness
distance to the center (Sagittarius-A) of the galaxy.

What is available? Which source of such data would be most recommended?
