Type Ia supernova by fallback?

Is it possible for a massive star of more than 1.4 solar masses (probably around 3 or more but below the threshold for type II) to collapse into a white dwarf and a planetary nebula, then go supernova as the ejected material falls back onto the white dwarf?
Edit: Have there been any candidates for such an event?
