Goldilocks Zone Temperature Range for Habitation

Is there a generally accepted Kelvin temperature range for exoplanets habitable zone.  So for example, I can look at for example, http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/toi-2134_b/ and say the planet is in the Goldilocks Temperature zone?  I don't want to know if the planet is in the zone, I want to know how to determine if the planet is in the zone.
305k TO 311.75K (converted from Celsius) seems a little narrow but is that right?

Or should I be looking at other values as well such as Semi-Major Axis ?
