How can astronomers determine the difference between "hydrostatic equilibrium" and "just happens to be spherical"?

This is relevant for the definition of a dwarf planet.
I presume the answer will be, well, if we can tell the mass of the body and guess the material.   I don't find this very satisfactory because (1) may be impossible and (2) will have large error.
