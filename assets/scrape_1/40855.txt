Mercury's spin-orbit resonance

When was it confirmed that Mercury has a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance and by whom (research group/radio observations...)? The first suggestion was made by Giuseppe Colombo in 1965.
Its proximity to the sun posed some problems in nailing the orbit and rotation of Mercury, but what made it eventually possible to measure it? Was there a breakthrough or development of a technology or was it just "steady scientific progress"?
