Could the earth become a star if more mass was added?

I've heard that the only difference between a star and a planet is mass, meaning that if planets accredited enough mass they would too become stars.

Does this mean that the star started off as a planet?
Stars require hydrogen fusion and earth has little H. Could the earth become a star if more mass was added, but its relatively low abundance of hydrogen remained the same?
