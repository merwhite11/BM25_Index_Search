Telescope magnification compared to distance from an object

I'm looking at Saturn through a modest telescope at 50x. What point in space, expressed as the distance from Saturn, let's say it's 750 million miles from Earth, would I need to view Saturn with the naked eye and see it at the same apparent size as viewed from Earth at 50x. How do I estimate this in general for other objects as well. Thanks!
