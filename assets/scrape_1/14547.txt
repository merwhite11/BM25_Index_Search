What is the fifth moon-like object I saw around jupiter through my telescope?

Tonight while observing Jupiter I was able to see a five (what looked like) moons. I have observed Jupiter often before and only been able to make out the four galilean moons. It's my understanding that through my 8-inch scope it would be impossible for me to see any others. Switching to a widefield lens I was able to see Jupiter along with some nearby stars however the 5 moon-like points around it all still appeared... well, moon-like in comparison to the bright stars. 
I observed Jupiter from about 2016-04-15 05:20 to 05:40 UTC and all five of the moon-like objects were present the whole time. What was I probably looking at?
