Why Saturn has more Moons than Jupiter?

Why does Saturn have more moons than Jupiter, I know the grand tack hypothesis suggests Jupiter migrated from 3.5 au to present orbit but given that Jupitern is more massive meaning a larger hillsphere and closer to the asteroid belt and inner solar system, with multiple minor bodies to be captured. I know many moons remain undetected but can anybody please give explanation for this. Thanks in advance
