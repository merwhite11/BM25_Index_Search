A thought experiment for gravitational waves

My question is:
I want to in a thought experiment, calculate the gravitational waves that are generated while I Shake my hands?
-A hand mass:~400 gr
& Frequency: 3 times per second.
Here is what I want to solve in this experiment:
1-Find h (strain)
2-Find flux (over 1 meter away from my hands as a source in impact of A = 1 cm square)
3-Find damping (for example after pass through a wall 10 meter away from my hands with 1 meter thickness)
Note: we have some equation that they can help us:
1-For calculating the strain and flux here is the formula: https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/53547/50779
2-For calculating damping:
