Is it possible for a star to return in the main sequence?

Is it possible for a star to return to the main sequence after entered in the post-main sequence phase? I have no clue if there's a mechanism such as acquiring hydrogen from from the environment or from a substellar body might bring again the star into the main sequence. Was it ever explored as a possibility?
