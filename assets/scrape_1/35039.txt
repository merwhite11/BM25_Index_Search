What's the first written record of the moon being tidally locked to the earth?

I couldn't find references as to who first noticed (wrote down) that the moon was tidally locked to the Earth. This, to me, doesn't seem obvious from first glance, and looks like something only found with cautious observations.
More specifically, I'd want to know when this first realized, from this question I gather that even acknowledging the moon as a moon took a long time, but the observation (or explanation of it) that it is tidally locked is missing from that. 
Would be surprised if Aristarchus of Samos already noticed this!
