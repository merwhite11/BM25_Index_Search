Why does my 10mm eyepiece produce blurry images?

I own a tabletop Sky-Watcher Heritage 130mm tabletop Dobsonian with a f/5 130mm aperture and 630mm focal length. 25mm wide-field eyepiece and a 10mm narrow-angle eyepiece. Last night I took it out to see the crescent moon. Initially, I used the 25mm wide-field on focused on the Moon and the image came out properly with minimal blur. However, when I replaced the 25mm with the 10mm narrow-angle eyepiece, the image was really blurred, making the moon a blob. Am I doing something wrong?
