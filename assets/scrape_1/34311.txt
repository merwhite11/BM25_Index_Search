Could the barycenter orbit of our sun be greatly underestimated?

The radius of the suns orbit around the barycenter of the solar system is often measured to be roughly the radius of the sun. Based on the same type of bias that has made humans miss things about their solar system because they are looking at it from the vantage point of Earth orbiting inside the system, is it possible that the suns orbit around the barycenter is actually much larger?
