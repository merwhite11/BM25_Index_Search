Time evolution data of the Great Red Spot on Jupiter?

Jupiter's Great Red Spot fascinates scientists for ages, so it does me. Where can I find a table (e.g. as CSV-file) with the time evolution of longitude, latitude, horizontal and vertical extension of the Great Red Spot? I am sure somebody did already invest the time to extract such a time series from all available (historical) records and images, but it
looks like I am searching a needle in a haystack.
