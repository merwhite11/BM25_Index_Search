Are there collected data about the direction of rotation of black holes and the direction of the magnetic field?

Is there a relation between the direction of rotation of black holes or neutron stars and the magnetic dipole moment of BH or neutron stars? BTW, are there different directions of this two parameters for suns?
Edit
I want to be sure there are or there are not the direction of rotation (which one can expressed by an arrow on the rotation axis) and the direction of the magnetic field (expressed by an arrow from the south to the north pole (both arrows are simple conventions)) parallel only. I'm not sure that the direction of the magnetic field is observable at all. And the comment from Zibadawa Timmy about pulsars perhaps a good extension to my question about BH, neutron stars and Suns.
