Wouldn't the 1054 supernova have temporarily enlightened the Earth like the Sun?


The peak luminosity of all type Ia supernovae is 1.60Ã—1036 Watts. If we see a star go supernova from earth, and we observe its intensity to be 1.0 W/m2. The intensity of the Sun is about 6.33x107 W/m2.

Now, I have read that a supernova explosion intensity can exceed that of the whole Milky Way (or even 50 times!. The 1054 supernova, of which  the Crab Nebula is a remnant (see pictures below), was seen to be about four times the intensity of Venus. But shouldn't it at 6700 lightyears distance, have looked  brighter than the Sun for a moment?

The neutron star in the nebula, spinning about 30 times per second!
