GEO and HEO images of Earth

I would like to see some GEO and HEO images of Earth. But I can't find a good source. There are a lot of LEO images of Earth but I can'f find any raw images from higher (preferably 30,000km+) altitudes. There should be at least 400 satellites at that height, according to Wikipedia.
Is there any website with those kind of images?
