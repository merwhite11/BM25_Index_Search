How often does a full moon happen on the weekend?

Wikipedia says that a synodic month has a length 29 d 12 h 44 min and 2.9 s.
I'm interested to find out how often a full moon (but actually, it's the same for any phase) happens during a weekend.
I thought:

a weekend lasts 48 h
a week has 168 h
a synodic month has 708.75 h

But I'm not able to calculate when the full moon happens inside the window of the 48 h we call "weekend".
