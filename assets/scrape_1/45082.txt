What is the exact reason for the Sun's differential rotation to occur?

The following is an excerpt from the Wikipedia article for "Differential Rotation":

Differential rotation is seen when different parts of a rotating
object move with different angular velocities (rates of rotation) at
different latitudes and/or depths of the body and/or in time. This
indicates that the object is not solid. In fluid objects, such as
accretion disks, this leads to shearing. Galaxies and protostars
usually show differential rotation; examples in the Solar System
include the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn.
The cause of differential rotation
Stars and planets rotate in the first place because conservation of  angular momentum turns random drifting of parts of the molecular cloud that they form from into rotating motion as they coalesce. Given this average
rotation of the whole body, internal differential rotation is caused
by convection in stars which is a movement of mass, due to steep
temperature gradients from the core outwards. This mass carries a
portion of the star's angular momentum, thus redistributing the
angular velocity, possibly even far enough out for the star to lose
angular velocity in stellar winds. Differential rotation thus depends
on temperature differences in adjacent regions.

Can you please explain the cause of differential rotation described above in a very simple way?
