Do radio telescopes see other stars better at night?

As you know, we don’t see stars with the naked eye during the day because of the visible glare of our Sun.
As I understand our Sun emits radio frequency waves, too. Is there a radio ‘glare’ from the Sun such that radio telescopes can better focus on other stars during the night?
