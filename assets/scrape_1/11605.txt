What if our galaxy didn't have a SMBH?

From my understanding, it is believed that almost every big galaxy and especially spiral galaxies have supermassive black holes (SMBH's) at the center. Also, from what I've read, a SMBH isn't required for a galaxy to exist since and in layman's terms, the matter inside a galaxy such it gas clouds and formation of stars will keep it gravitational-ly in check. 
If I am right or even wrong, then would there be significant difference if our galaxy did not have a SMBH at the center? Significant enough for noticeable differences even here on Earth?
