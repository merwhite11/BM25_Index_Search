Would a satellite in geosynchronous orbit between the earth and moon track across the sky together?

On Nov. 25 at 2:30a.m. from southern California while viewing the moon with a 70mm D x 400mm F telescope a point of light was seen at about the 7 o'clock position below the moon. As viewed the point of light was clear and seemed to be tracking with the moon. As I tracked the moon the point of light stayed within the same distance and in view. If it was a planet or star wouldn't they track slightly different than the moon ?
