What exactly is a fortney grid transmission spectra modeling

I am trying to model some exoplanets and I don't understand how this model works. Below is a link of the model. What I donâ€™t understand is how does graphing the transit depth  vs wavelength provide information. I am trying to determine the atmospheric chemistry/atmosphere/properties of planets.
