What visual artifacts are expected from the JWST?

What visual artifacts should we expect from the images that will be released from the James Webb Space Telescope? Specifically, do we expect 3-pronged diffraction spikes (any preview how they would look?)? Do we expect any artifacts due to the honeycomb-like structure of the main mirror?
