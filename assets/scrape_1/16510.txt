Data reduction and photometry without IRAF?

The IRAF package is old.
I've been looking around for a more modern software to replace it in the processes of CCD data reduction and photometry, but haven't been able to find any.
The closest I've found is the PyRAF tool, but this seems more like a Python wrapper around IRAF rather than a replacement for it.
Is there some new software I might've miss or is IRAF really the only option even today?

Add:
I forgot to mention this, but I'm looking for tools that work under Linux and are free (open source + no charge), if possible. I will not pay (neither for a Windows license nor for a software package) to get rid of IRAF.
