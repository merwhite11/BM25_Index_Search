Retrofitting a Dobsonian Reflecting Telescope for smart phones?

Just received an old Orion Deep Space Explorer 6" Dobsonian Reflecting Telescope.  I'm hoping to gift it to my kids, but I want to add a twist...
We have a microscope with an adapter for an iPhone that has been great fun with allowing time lapse photography and very nice images on large monitors, so I wanted to accomplish something similar with this device.  Telescopes, in the past, have always been a dud due to the lack of multiple kids and family members wanting to be able to see the display simultaneously.
Has anyone had any experience at retrofitting a unit such as this with an adapter that has given good results?  Any gotchas to be aware of?
I'm eying the "HookUpz 2.0 Universal Smartphone Optics Digiscoping Adapter", but a little worried as I've never retrofitted such a device before and would like to hit this spot on since the timeframe is tight for me.
