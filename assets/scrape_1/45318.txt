how much time do Alpha Centauri A and B have?

According to Wikipedia:
Alpha Centauri A: $M=1.100 M_\odot$ and $L = 1.519 L_\odot$
Alpha Centauri B: $M=0.907M_\odot$ and $L=0.5002L_\odot$
They are 5-6 billion years old (you can assume they are 5.5 billion years old). How long will they live?
It would be good if you could also give some dates about the red giant phase, thanks.
