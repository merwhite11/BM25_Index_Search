why couldn't atoms form in the early big bang?

I'm asking about the time when temperature was super high, but at that time we already had proton, neutron, electrons.
It seems they were moving super fast due to temperature being so high.
What I'm curious about is why they couldn't get together to form atom. I read some stuff, where collision would happen and the high-energy particles collided with each other at a rapid pace, transferring energy and preventing the formation of stable atomic nuclei. but I don't really get it.
Would you be willing to explain it in simple terms by step by step the reason ?
