What Would it Look Like Inside Jupiter's Great Red Spot?

From what I've read, Jupiter's 'Great Red Spot' is an unbelievably powerful storm. Do astronomers and scientists have any idea of what that might look like if it were possible to be inside/below it? Would it look like a storm on Earth (thunder, lightning, winds, etc.), or would it look completely different?
