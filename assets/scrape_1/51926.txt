Can the curvature of a closed universe be measured?

Suppose we were in a closed universe likened with a spherical surface such as that of the Earth's surface.
Assume also that the limits, represented by the limits of the observable universe, corresponds to a continent which would not have information from other continents.
Obviously the inhabitants of any continent could not send a light beam out to be observed coming back.
Is this a correct description of the real situation and are there other less dramatic experiments we might make to determine the universeâ€™s possible curvature?
