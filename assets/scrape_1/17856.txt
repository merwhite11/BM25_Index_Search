Do astronomers measure radio waves absorption to know the shape of a celestial body?

I do not have much knowledge about radio astronomy. I know that astronomers know an objects' shape by measuring the reflected photons that reach radiotelescopes, but can they measure also the absorbed ones for the same purpose?
