Why did the edge of Olympus Mons collapse?

On Earth, the maximum height for a mountain is ~10 km. Beyond that, the mountain will start to spread or collapse. On the surface of Mars, the gravity is not as strong, so the maximum height for a mountain is higher.
The edges of Olympus Mons are very steep cliffs, rather than being a shallow slope all the way down. Surrounding the mountain, there is a large aureole that looks like it might be left over from landslides.
Did the edges of Olympus Mons collapse and cause a landslide because the mountain reached the maximum height for Mars? Or was some other process involved?
