Should you include aberration effects during low Earth orbit observations?

I am working on calibration of some observations of low Earth orbit satellites and I am wondering should I include aberration effects? My logic is that diurnal aberration would have neglegible magnitude for such low orbit (I have at best 2-3 arcsecs of precision) and annual aberration does not have any effect, because satellites are rotating around a Sun together with Earth. Is my logic correct or magnitudes of aberration effects are bigger than I think?
