Can a material other than glass be used for making telescope mirrors?

Although I do know of a few instances where professional or observatory mirrors have been made by alternate materials, it was primarily for targeting specific nuances, like weight reduction and low thermal expansion etc. 
I was more keen on finding a material whose primary unique selling point is low cost ;P , keeping in mind a budding amateur astronomer.
