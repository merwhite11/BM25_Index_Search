Could a planet have a massive crater without collapsing due to gravity / other factors?

A severely destroyed planet is a popular trope in media. Here are a few examples from fiction with pictures (spoiler warning).

A crater with a diameter 1/3rd the size of the planet itself:

A crater so large that nearly half of the planet is missing:

A planet so destroyed that only a sliver remains, still maintaining the crescent shape of the partial sphere:

A planet cracked in half with both halves offset from each other:

I know that the physical behavior of objects changes dramatically with scale, one example being the anatomical differences between insects and elephants. I would imagine, at a planetary scale, that the last three examples may just collapse back into a spherical shape because of gravity.
Could these planetary bodies actualy maintain the shape we see in fictional media?
