What would happen if a wormhole gets swallowed by a black hole?

Assume wormholes exist. One hole allows matter to pop out of another hole somewhere else in the universe.
If one end of the wormhole is swallowed by a black hole, then no information can get from that end to the other hole.
If the wormhole acts as some kind of gateway to another part of the universe, wouldn't that mean that the entire universe would be swallowed by the black hole? ie. the wormhole end is an entry portal to the entire universe, so if that is inside the black hole, wouldn't that mean the entire universe is then in the black hole?
