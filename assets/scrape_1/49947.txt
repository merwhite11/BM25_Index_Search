Life forms on planets not requiring water and oxygen as basic building blocks

When scientists explore other planets such as Mars, they look for life derived from water and oxygen (correct me if I am wrong) with a purpose to see whether that planet is habitable for humans or not.
Now, my question is it possible for life to originate in the universe from sources that do not require water, oxygen and carbon as the basic building blocks? If so, does that also mean that with today's science and technology we won't be able to detect such life forms?
This question might be asked earlier, but I guess current knowledge may have an updated answer to this question.
