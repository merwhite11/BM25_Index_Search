What is the speed of time?

From the theory of relativity, if any object is moving with the speed of light or more than the speed of light, then the time stops or seemed to be stopped for that object. That means, that the speed of time for an object moving with the speed of light is zero.
So what will be the speed of time for an object in the space, travelling at a negligible speed(i.e.,zero) or approximately stationary.
