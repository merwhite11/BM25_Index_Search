Does the critical density of the Universe also include Dark Energy?

It is often said that it seems that the Universe is quite close to critical density (for example https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Critical+Density).
Does this include Dark Energy as well (apart from Dark matter and Baryonic matter)?
