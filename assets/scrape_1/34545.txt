Did the late 2019 "fainting" of Betelgeuse show any spectral trends that differ from it's normal variability?

update: (August 2020) With all the newest news about  including what the Dr. Becky video discusses as linked in How do magnetic fields mess with astronomers' observations? I'll bet this question can now be answered!
update: (June 2023) (much!) more at Dr. Becky's New study claims Betelgeuse supernova IMMINENT (decades not centuries!) | Night Sky News June 2023 (links to papers & preprints in the notes below the video)

The Astronomers Telegrams #13341 The Fainting of the Nearby Red Supergiant Betelgeuse and #13365 Updates on the “Fainting” of Betelgeuse (both in December 2019) discuss the importance of measuring color temperature and spectral features of the needed observations.
Did this fainting episode show the same kinds of spectral changes behavior as the irregular but more limited variation in brightness, or did it contain a dimming component that affects it differently, for example as intervening material (e.g. dust, debris, broken planets) might do?

Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, there, I said it, now let's wait 700 years to see what happens.
