Why does the Chandrasekhar limit affect white dwarfs differently?

The Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star. Beyond this, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf will typically explode in a type 1a supernova, due to the nuclear reactions at those temperatures.
I've heard that oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, on the other hand, will not ignite. Rather, electron capture becomes energetically favorable and they become neutron stars. If I understand correctly, this also happens for carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in binaries, if the white dwarf has most of the mass in the system.
Why is this? Can anyone walk me through, step by step, what happens if a white dwarf (of both compositions) exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, and how each differs?
