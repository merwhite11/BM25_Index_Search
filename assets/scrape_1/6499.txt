How could we observe Dyson spheres?

Hypothetically, if Dyson spheres were already present, how could we observe them? My layman understanding of the reason we believe dark matter exists is that our current estimates of the total mass of the universe is very different from the observed stars. But what if a significant proportion of those stars were covered? My obvious hypothesis is that this would explain the missing mass of the universe, and solve both the question of dark matter and the existence of aliens.
