Would lightning on planets with noble gas rich atmospheres cause a glow similar to an electric discharge lamp?

I've read about how noble gases in gas tubes emit varying colors of light when electricity is passed through them
For a planet with noble gas rich atmospheres (say >20%), would a lightning strike cause the local area around the strike to glow brightly in the color corresponding to that of the specific noble gas?
