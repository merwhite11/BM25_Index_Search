What is the lower limit of a coronal mass ejection?

Reading an 2005 article by Fraser Cain called Smallest Ever Coronal Mass Ejection
 I became interested in the exact definition of CME.
It seems like a simple question - but I did not manage to find the answer to the question myself. Is there a smallest possible coronal mass ejection (CME)? Is there a theoretical limit or is it a matter of observing capabilities?
Note: I left intentionally open whether "small" refers to mass, size, duration, or any other parameter.
The above mentioned article claims that the CME in the square in the following picture is actually the smallest CME:
