Notifier about visible ISS passes and/or Iridium flares for Ubuntu PC

I am trying to find application that would be capable of notifying me about 
visible ISS pases for specified location and/or visible Iridium flares for specified location.
This software must be capable of running on Ubuntu.
I strongly prefer active open-source projects.
I know that there are multiple mobile apps but I want something that may run on Linux PC.
To avoid "this is subjective" - I will be happy about any software fulfilling this requirements and criteria are not subjective.
