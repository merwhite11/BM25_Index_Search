What is the exact time Earth takes to revolve around its axis?

I read that our day is not exactly 24 hours long. If it is not then why weather seasons come at the same time (Summer, Winter, Autumn Spring) ? how it is equalized ?

Update: Sorry I could not make it clear. My meaning was if 3.8 seconds are shorter of everyday the how is the calculation made that summer starts in May and winter start december everytime why it does not move further since. How time is neutralized ? I hope you guys understood this time.
