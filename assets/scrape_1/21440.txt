Which would be safer: removing hydrogen or adding hydrogen to our sun?

If we want to extend the lifespan of our habitable zone safely, would it be safer to institute a yearly 'tax' on our suns outer layer of hydrogen, or a yearly 'subsidy' to our suns outer layer of hydrogen?
(the feasibility of said tax/subsidy is beyond the scope of this question)
Another way to ask this question:
Assuming the core of the sun remains untouched,
but its outer layer of hydrogen were reduced by half,
would the suns main sequence remain intact for a longer time?
To avoid ending up with a white dwarf and its associated bad weather, what would be the ideal point to reverse the tax and re-subsidize?
