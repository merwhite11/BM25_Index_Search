During a total solar eclipse is it possible to see solar flares with the naked eye?

I read that it might be possible but I am wondering can I actually see small flames jetting from the surface around the circumference of the eclipse assuming they are active at the time?  There is a total solar eclipse in 2024 that I will be able to see.
I have binoculars and since I will have about a minute of total coverage would the binoculars add any value and would they be safe?
