Active Galactic Nuclei - categorisation on the basis of observer?

As we know AGNs are considered to be one of the most luminous objects to be found in the cosmos.Based on the observer, for instance on Earth,  we categorize them on the basis of the angle between the observer and the object. Suppose for instance there are two observers, one on Earth and one on some distant planet (far away from our solar system,  let it be on the opposite side of the Milky Way relative to us). Would both the observers relate an AGN belonging to the same class? In other words, can these categories be relative to their viewing? Like an object can be a QSO to us but to the other observer can the same object be a Seyfert or a Blazar or an RG?
