What would be a good telescope to buy for amateur practice? [ Specifications in description ]

I'm a beginner in Astronomy in general and would like to have something like this with which I could do amateur photography and generally practice.
What would be a good telescope to buy with the following specifications:

Magnification: 250x - 500x
Mount with controller and camera ( Software would be preferable )

Regarding budget I know that these specifications can be costly and expensive but I would be comfortable with anything under 900, 1000 USD.
I did some research regarding this, I have some choices but I think that asking here I would get more interesting choices that I could put in my research from someone that's more experienced.
