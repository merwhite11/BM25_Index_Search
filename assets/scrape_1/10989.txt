Why won't the Milky Way colliding with Andromeda affect the Solar System?

According to Wikipedia

Such an event would have no adverse effect on the system and the chances of any sort of disturbance to the Sun or planets themselves may be remote.

I'm imagining that this is because the distance between stars is so big, it'd be highly unlikely for any star to actually collide.
But the Oort Cloud is 2 light years in diameter. Given that the average distance between stars in the Milky Way is about 5 light years, that's almost half way. If Alpha Centauri had an Oort Cloud of the same size, we'd already almost be overlapping each other.
Assuming that we're not the only star with an Oort Cloud, isn't there a high probability that the Sun will actually be inside the Oort Cloud of a passing star?
I would imagine this would because the Sun and our planet would be bombarded with lots of comets which have been thrown off their orbits by either the gravity of the Sun or the passing star.
