Can Pluto be seen with the naked eye from Neptune when Pluto and Neptune are closest?

When Neptune and Pluto are closest, about 100 million mi (160 million km) from each other, would an observer on Neptune (or rather on one of its moons, since Neptune is gaseous) be able to see Pluto, and maybe even Charon, with the naked eye? If not, could Pluto be seen in average binoculars? I think Pluto would appear a bit smaller than Mercury from Earth (but at much lower apparent brightness because of the distance from the Sun).
