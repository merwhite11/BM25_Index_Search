Powerful-enough telescopes to observe the Lunar Roving Vehicle from Earth?

Apparently, not even the Hubble telescope (which is actually in orbit, not even on Earth) is powerful enough to observe the LVR... will we ever have the technology to observe the LVR from Earth?
(it would be my dream to be able to observe the Apollo relics with a "retail" telescope. I am no expert in optics, so have no idea if for example "computer-enhanced" zooming could work, instead of a giant mirror?)
