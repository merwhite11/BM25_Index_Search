At what size do objects burn up in the atmosphere when falling from orbit?

As the title suggests, I am wondering the maximum size an object can be so that it will completely burn up when entering and falling through Earth's atmosphere. I'm focusing on man made objects, not asteroids or meteors. Also, how much does the make-up of the object affect its burn rate? I.e. metal vs plastic vs glass, and so on.
Thanks!
