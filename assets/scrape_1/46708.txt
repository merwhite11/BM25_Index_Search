Is Jupiter warming the Earth? (Earth, Sun Jupiter system)

If Sun-Jupiter baricentre is outside the Sun, does that mean the Sun is orbiting around that point too right?
Then the Sun shouldn't be nearer to the Earth at some point during the Sun-Jupiter orbit (and also farther at the opposite point)?
Sun-Jupiter orbit completes every 11.86 Earth years, so why we don't (or yes we do?) have cycles with hot/cold weather every 6 years?
