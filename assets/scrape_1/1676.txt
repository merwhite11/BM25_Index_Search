What would happen if a body were to fall into a neutron star?

We know neutron stars as a very massive object with extremely strong gravitational forces that composes mostly of neutrons.
I couldn't help but wonder, what would happen if an object fell into a neutron star, what would become of it? Will it turn it into neutrons as well? And will be any sort of accompanying radiation emission?
