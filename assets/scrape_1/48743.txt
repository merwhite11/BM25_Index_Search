How do I create a comoving quantity using YT?

I can assign a unit to a scalar using:
x = YTQuantity(scalar, 'kpc')
but how would I specify that the unit should be kpccm? Perhaps it doesn't even make sense to do so? Something as simple as this is not the answer:
x = YTQuantity(scalar, 'kpccm')
Thank you,
Paul
