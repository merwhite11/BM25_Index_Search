Can you see something active in the sky apart from satellites? Can there be amateur time-domain astronomy?

What I mean is an event unfolding that is viewable by naked eye or telescopes, and doesn't take comparing days of footage to see moving pixels. Apart from satellites, is there something that moves or happens so quickly that humans could sense it within a reasonable time? The whole sky is like a still painting, I'd love to see parts of it being "animated". Things on my mind are:

Crescent moon occulting a star (revealing or hiding it)
Solar and Lunar eclipses

Or more exotic things like:

Stars exploding (catching that as it happens, is it even possible?)
Other planets' moons moving a reasonabl/detectable amount in 30 minutes perhaps
Slow pulsar blinking (they are still super fast afaik)
Star changing its brightness and not blinking due to haze/turbulence
