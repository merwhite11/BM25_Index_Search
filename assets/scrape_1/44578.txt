Learning astrophysics from zero

I'm a liberal arts student, an undergraduate English student who out of the blue, started getting interested in astronomy and physics, searching for facts all the time, googling about some theories, etc...
Yet, as I didn't follow the path of Science and anything related to it, I have no idea about either physics or astronomy and their concepts, but I decided to discover this field in my way.
So the question is; is it possible for me to learn astrophysics and embrace its world just by myself, knowing that I'm 20 yo. Would this journey be such a difficult thing to do that will later on turn to be a waste of time?
If this may be possible, what would be a good introductory resource where one can "test the water" to get a feel for the the concepts and start to see how difficult a thing this may turn out to be?
