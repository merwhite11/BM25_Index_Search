What happens if supernova undergoes in tightly close multi stars system

I do wonder in a tight or close orbital binary stars or multi stars system, if one stars undergoes supernova and that blast can lead another stars in the system to become supernova, too?
Is there anything like chain-supernova happened in observable universe?
