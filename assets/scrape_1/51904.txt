Does the slowing of the spin of the Earth's core result in more coronal mass ejections?

Some recent studies indicate that the slowing of the spin of the Earth's core happens on a periodic basis, such as when it slowed 50 years ago in the 1970s and 80s. Would this slowing of the inner core open the magnetic shield to more CMEs?
