How to describe the Sun's location to an alien from our Galaxy?

Let's say you got to the planet orbiting other star in our Galaxy through the wormhole. You think that the travel was instant but you're not 100% sure and it is not exactly known. The planet is inhabited by aliens who agree to send you back but they would need to know coordinates of the star where you are from. Assume that finding a planet would not be a problem then.
Over time you manage to understand their equivalent of SI, i.e. their equivalent of kg/m/s and you can at least roughly map their units to ours.
How would you uniquely describe where the Sun is to those aliens with as much precision as possible?
Trying to answer this question myself (and I'm not a scientist and hardly remember anything advanced from my college days) - I was thinking that one distinct factor could be the size of the Sun (d=1.4 million km), temperature of the Sun's surface (~5700K), the Sun's rotation period (27 days), perhaps also describe similar parameters of the closest stars e.g. Alpha Centauri and the distance from the Sun to those stars. Then knowing these numbers a star could probably be uniquely identified, assuming that alien astronomers managed to collect searchable star parameters in their database. The only flaw I can see is that those numbers are probably not very reliable given that distances from the Sun to the neighbor stars may not be the same if travel actually did took some time. And the only "fix" for this I can think of is also memorizing rough age of the Sun as of this moment - perhaps as well as neighbor stars to narrow down the search.
Is there a simpler / perhaps more comprehensive way to uniquely describe where the Sun is without memorizing too many numbers?
