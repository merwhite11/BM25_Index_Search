(Thought experiment) if we put a huge mirror into space, could we see back in time to the big bang?

This is an addition to this question which is closed:
By putting a mirror in space, would we be able to see into the past?
Imagine there is a supernova a hundred years ago. Lots of people see it but nobody has a decent telescope. A hundred years later we point a powerful telescope in the opposite direction, and find a huge alien mirror a hundred light years away, that allows us to watch the supernova.
My question is, what is the limit of such a technique?
Could we see right back to the big bang if the mirror was large enough and far enough away?
Please note this is not a question about whether the telescope or mirror are realistically possible.
Assume we are using some superior alien technology.
