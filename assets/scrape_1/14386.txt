What happens if two or three stars collide with each other?

After finding out that there is a solar system with three stars, I did extensive research. I couldn't get a definitive answer. What would happen if they collided with each other?
I know there would be total destruction everywhere, but I would like to know what, including more scientific short- and long- term effects, would happen?
If you can't explain three stars, two stars colliding would be okay. I'm still an amateur at astronomy, so please don't make the answer too complicated.
