Does the expansion of space stretch the space-time fabric?

This question appeared to me when I was thinking about General Relativity. During the expansion of space, the space in which particles reside is expanded. Now, general relativity states gravity is the curvature of space-time. So does this expanded fabric of space-time behave the same way as regular space-time (as in space-time before some magnitude of expansion), or does it behave in a different way than how our normal Earth tensile materials which have are stretched?
