Gravitational influence of other planets?

I have a friend who believes in astrology and she insists that the gravitational influence of the planets has an effect on the child when it's born. The last time she was going on about this a thought occurred to me. I wonder which is stronger, the gravitational effect of heavenly objects or the the gravitational effects of the delivery room staff?
Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Thanks.
