How much of the surface of other planets is lit by the sun?

Since the sun is much larger than the earth, it should ideally light up a considerable portion of the earth rather than only half of it.
However the sun lighting only half of the earth can be explained using the fact that the sun is at a considerable distance away from the earth. As the distance of a light source from the object increases the portion of the object lit up reduces.
Applying the same logic to other planets (especially the ones beyond the earth), I would like to know how much of the surface of these other planets is lit up by the sun?
Going by the distance thing, a portion less than half should be lit up, which would mean a fraction of the surface (mainly around the centre from north to south) would always be in darkness.
Would be nice if diagrams could be used to explain
