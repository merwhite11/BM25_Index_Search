What is it like to see a brown dwarf turn into a star?

Brown dwarfs/failed stars can actually become stars, if they exceed a mass limit of about 80 Jupiter masses. This is when the internal pressure and temperature at the core become high enough to literally ram protium atoms into each other to release energy.
But does this transition occur all of a sudden, i.e. it turns instantly into a star after exceeding the mass limit?
Or does this transition take gradually, i.e. after exceeding this limit, the brown dwarf slowly and gradually turns into a star?
The question here is:
