Has the new type II supernova SN 2023ixf's subtype been determined yet, and is a tentative light curve possible? Is it still getting brighter?

Wikipedia's article on SN 2023ixf begins:

SN 2023ixf is a type II (core collapse) supernova located in the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101). It was first observed on May 19, 2023 by Koichi Itagaki and immediately classified as a type II supernova. Initial magnitude at discovery was 14.9. After discovery, the Zwicky Transient Facility project found a precovery image of the supernova at magnitude 15.87 two days before discovery. The supernova is about 21 million light-years from Earth and is expected to have left behind either a neutron star or black hole based on current stellar evolution models.

Wikipedia's Type II supernova discusses several classes (e.g. -L, -P, n, b) and these don't all share a single "universal" light curve
I've never (knowingly) seen a supernova and still don't have a telescope of my own. However there are several I know about. I'm curious how bright this SN will get and how quickly it will dim. To that end, I'd like to ask:
Question: Has the new type II supernova SN 2023ixf's subtype been determined yet, and is a tentative light curve possible? Is it still getting brighter?

From Sky & Telescope's A supergiant star exploded as a supernova in the prominent galaxy M101 in Ursa Major. It’s now bright enough to see in a 4.5-inch telescope!


The new supernova SN 2023ixf, pictured here on May 21st, shines close to a prominent HII region, NGC 5461, in an outer spiral arm of the bright galaxy M101. Discovered on May 19th at magnitude 14.9, it has already brightened to magnitude 11. The object is located 227.7″ east and 134.1″ south of the galaxy's center at R.A. 14h 03m 38.6″ and Dec. +54° 18′ 42″. M101 lies approximately 21 million light-years away, making this one of the closest supernovae visible in recent years. (Eliot Herman)
