Are accretion disks the only way stellar planetary systems form?

The accepted theory for the formation of our Solar System is from an accretion disk.  A molecular cloud is thought to have collapsed under its own gravity and formed a disk.  Most of the matter in the cloud formed the Sun, and the remaining matter was either ejected or formed the planets and other bodies (e.g. moons, asteroids, comets).
Question:  Now that we've discovered many extra-solar planets, are there theories differing from the accretion disk theory for the formation of planetary stellar systems?
