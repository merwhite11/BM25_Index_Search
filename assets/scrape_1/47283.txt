Looking for an interactive star chart

First, apologies; I understand this is like a software request over at Stack Overflow.
I'm looking for a star chart for a friend that likes to stargaze while in his outdoors hot tub. He is at latitude 61 degrees and longitude about 17 degrees.
Is there a map/chart where he can look up in the sky and say
-Oh look here that's the Andromeda galaxy!
while still in the tub?
I'd like the map to follow or at least indicate the seasonal variation.
My budget sits around $300.
Any $5 solutions are of course welcome too.
