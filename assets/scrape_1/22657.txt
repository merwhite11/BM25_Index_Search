The photos of the outer space

How did the humans take photos for the galaxies, black holes, stars, nebulas etc in the outer space?!
I guess they went out of the Earth planet and nearly out of the Milky Way galaxy by space-ships or probes and that is how they took photos for the stars, nebulas, blackholes, and galaxies in the outer space
If my guess is wrong then how did they do it?!
