Which planet, viewed from which other planet would appear the largest?

Inspired by this question, I'm curious:  Which planet in our solar system, when viewed from which other planet, would appear the largest/brightest?  You probably can't really see much of Uranus from Neptune as that question asked, but could you clearly see any other planet from another planet?  (Assuming ideal conditions of both planets being at their closest possible distance from each other, and maybe just from an orbiting satellite around the viewing planet so as to avoid any atmospheric effects.)
And would it appear larger or brighter than just the stars around it?  From Earth, all of the planets we can see are near indistinguishable from stars to the untrained eye without a telescope.  But if you were closer to them, are there any planets close enough to each other and/or large enough that one could be seen as obviously a planet from the other?  I'd bet on Venus from Mercury based on minimal distance, but Jupiter from Mars would be a good contender given how large it is.
