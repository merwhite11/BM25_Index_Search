Distance between Earth and where The Big Bang's happened?


The universe is around 13.8 billion years old.
We know how fast the light is.
We also know how fast our galaxy moving around inside observable universe.

Is it possible to calculating distance between Earth and the place where The Big Bang happened ? If so how far away our planet ? and is there a something special about this place ? (A black hole or something else really crazy?)
