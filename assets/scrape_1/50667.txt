How bright will Alpha Centauri A be from Earth when it becomes a red giant?

As of right now, both stars from Alpha Centauri are in their main sequence stages, but eventually Alpha Centauri A is going to quickly expand in a matter of time, and Iâ€™m pretty sure its luminosity is going to increase substantially. So, how bright would it be from Earth?
