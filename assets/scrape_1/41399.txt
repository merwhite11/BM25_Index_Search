Can you escape a black hole by going into another (4th) dimension?

I imagine if there was a 2D black hole on a piece of paper, and something was inside the black hole had access to the 3rd dimension, they could just go "upwards" out of the black hole. Could it be possible, that if there were something, perhaps a particle that was inside a blackhole, escape it by going into the 4th dimension and back into the 3rd dimension elsewhere in space?
