How did Parker Solar Probe take what looks like 2D cross-sections of the solar wind in photographs; high contrast streaks in focus from volume effect?

The new NASA Goddard video NASA's Parker Solar Probe Touches The Sun For The First Time shows what looks like they might be photographs of the solar wind.
I'm having a hard time understanding how such clear 2D images can be taken of a 3D volume effect. I see high contrast bright and dark streaks and other structures as if a 2D slide was taken, but the camera doesn't have a narrow depth of focus on large scales and I assume these are kilometer or larger structures.
So I'm confused by these images.
Question: How did Parker Solar Probe take what looks like 2D cross-sections of the solar wind in photographs? How can we see high contrast streaks "in focus" from a presumably volume effect?
