Why is solar corona in visible light filamentary?

There is a video on YouTube (unfortunately in Czech) where Miloslav Druckm√ºller talks about structure of the solar corona in visible light. He explains that the filaments, clearly visible on his photographs, delineate magnetic field lines - the light coming from photosphere is scattered by free electrons which move along magnetic field lines.

What I don't understand (and he doesn't explain) how this explains the filamentary structure.
Why is the scattered light visible only along some field lines and not in between them?
