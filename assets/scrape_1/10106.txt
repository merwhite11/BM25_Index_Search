Brown dwarfs and planets

As far as I know, a brown dwarf is a 'star' whose core never underwent a fusion reaction, so it never became a star. 
So I was wondering if, apart from orbiting a star, is there any difference between a massive planet and a brown dwarf? 
I heard that they found an exoplanet 5 times the mass of Jupiter, and say a brown dwarf was in a binary pair where the other is a star: What stops it from being classified as a planet? 
I guess what I am really asking for is a clearer definition of a brown dwarf.
