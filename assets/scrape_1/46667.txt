Milky Way vs Milky Way Galaxy

I saw this question on Quizlet which said:

What is the difference between the Milky Way and the Milky Way Galaxy?

And the answer was:

The Milky Way is a fairly narrow band of faint diffuse light around the celestial sphere. The Milky Way Galaxy is a spiral galaxy of about 100 billion stars.

But isn't the term "Milky Way" means the Milky Way Galaxy? Why is there a difference? If there is a difference, could one include graphs that show the difference between the two?
