What type of star does theory predict should be the most massive?

The most massive known stars are Wolf-Rayet stars. However, as Wolf-Rayet stars do not appear to be the first stage of any star's lifecycle, I infer that whatever these Wolf-Rayet stars used to be must have been even more massive. My guess is that the most massive stars are Wolf-Rayet because of some combination of 1) their luminosity and/or 2) the potential short life of prior stages of the star's evolution. Assuming this is correct, to what group would we expect the most massive stars to belong (even if we don't know of specific examples)?
