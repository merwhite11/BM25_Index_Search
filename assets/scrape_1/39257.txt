Eyepiece::Astromania or Meoptex

I am looking into getting a zoom eyepiece for myself, and not sure on what basis to evaluate and compare various options.
For some background on the type of observing I plan to do see my earlier question: Good eyepieces for Saturn and Jupiter
Here are some examples of zoom eyepieces that I've looked at so far

Astromania 1.25" 7-21mm Zoom Eyepiece Apparent field of view is 30- degree at 21mm and 43- degree at 7mm
Meoptex 1.25"-7-21mm Zoom Eyepiece No further information

On these pages there are links to several more options.
It would be a very great help if anyone could help me figure out on what basis I might choose one of these or quickly rule some out, or recommend how I could search for more options.
