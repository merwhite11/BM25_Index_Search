If we "turned universe upside-down" and changed all matter to anti-matter instantly

...what would be the immediate consequences?
Or putting it better, if (from big-bang or whathever), the universe were always made of what we call Anti-matter what would it be?
The scientists of this universe would call 'Matter' 'Anti-Matter'.
Will the universe looks like exactly the same? By "looks", I mean the laws of Physics, the constitution of the universe with its superclusters of galaxies containing clusters containing galaxies and so on...
