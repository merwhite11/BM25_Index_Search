How do I intelligently revise the Yale Bright Star Catalog?

The Yale Bright Star Catalog was last revised in 1991. I'm thinking about making my own revision.
How would you do that? What kind of pitfalls should I avoid?
I'm especially interested in having robust data that allows one to calculate 3D proper motion:

proper motion in right ascension and declination
parallax
radial velocity

GAIA Data Release 3 is interesting, but it has a bright limit of mag ~3, so it can't be the sole source of data. I'm guessing I could fill most gaps with Hipparcos data, but Hipparcos seems to lack radial velocity data, so that would have to be supplemented by another data source.
One pitfall that I've noticed is that catalogs sometimes vary for multiple star systems. That is, catalog A might treat an object as being a single star, whereas catalog B might treat it as being  a multiple star system.
