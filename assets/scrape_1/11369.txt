If you're near a black hole and your time is slowed down, would a supernova be observable to both you and someone outside of the blackhole's pull?

Let's say that Person A is on a planet orbiting a black hole (like the one from Interstellar) and time is slowed for Person A. Person B is back home on Earth. Now let's say a supernova happens and it's possible for both parties to see it happen at the same time (ignoring the time it would take for the light to get there). Would Person A see the supernova at the same time as Person B? And if so, if Person A is in 1,000 B.C. and Person B is in 2,000 A.D, would the supernova then happen at two different times at the same time?
