If Earth's rotational speed is zero at the North Pole, why do stars still have apparent motion?

The apparent motion of stars (and other objects) results from Earth's spin on its axis, hence the rising and setting of some stars, and the circumpolar nature of others.
If the ground is not moving beneath your feet, then there shouldn't be any apparent motion from the North Pole. But my Stellarium app, when set to 90°N or 90°S, still shows all stars moving in circles around the North Celestial Pole.
What am I missing?
