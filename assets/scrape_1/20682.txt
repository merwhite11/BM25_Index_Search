A smudge near Jupiter

I was looking at the Jupiter for the first time today and I have noticed a smudge near it. Could someone explain what it is, please? I was looking online but did not find anything. So I thought that some kind of defect in my setup but I couldn't get rid of it. I mean the thing below its moons. 
Edit1:
My telescope is a Celestron AstroMaster 76 ESQ. The smudge was there no matter what eyepiece I have used. I was able to see it even without a camera. 
Edit2:
I was watching it for about 10 minutes, and the smudge was moving along with the rest of the objects. 
I took just this one image for the StackExchange purposes. I have put the camera in front of an eyepiece to take the picture.
Thank you
