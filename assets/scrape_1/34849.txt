Are Saturn's rings stable?

Saturn's rings contain many moonlets that shape the rings of Saturn. The structures in the rings of Saturn around moonlets are similar to those in protoplanetary disks around newly formed planets, which makes me wonder if the material in the rings will follow a similar fate and form into larger bodies. 
Will the material within the rings of Saturn eventually coalesce into moons, or are the rings of Saturn stable enough to last billions of years?
