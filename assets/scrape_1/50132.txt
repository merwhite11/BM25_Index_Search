Need help in writing a query using ADQL (Astronomical Data Query Language)

I am trying to query Gaia archive to get the medium quality sample as mentioned in Reico-Blanco et al. (2022) Gaia Data Release 3: Chemical cartography of the Milky Way. The idea is to query the flags_gspspec string where every letter represents one flag. The criteria for selecting the medium quality flag is as follows,

The first 13 characters are taken into consideration.
The last 4 characters must always be 0.
The seventh character could be one of one of (0,1,2,3).
The remaining eight flags must be either 0 or 1.

The problem gets even more complicated when we look at the allowed values for the flags,

The seventh character could take one of the values from (0,1,2,3,4,5,9).
All the other characters could take one of the values from (0,1,2,9).

I tried writing a Regular expression to match the type and it failed because ADQL does not support Regex. The only option that I could think of is to write a list of all possible combinations and include them in the LIKE clause. The problem is I am getting 1024 such combination from elementary combinatorics and its not practical to write down all the possible combinations.
If there is anybody out there who has worked on a similar problem before, please let me know. I would like to discuss this further.
PS: I do not know whether this is the right forum to post this since the query is more related to a database query and less of an astronomical question. Incase, this is not the right place, please redirect me to the right forum.
Thank you in advance.
