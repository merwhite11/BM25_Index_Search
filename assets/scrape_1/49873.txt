Gravitational mirroring: Can we theoretically see the Milky Way using a telescope?

As I am watching the beautiful deep field picture of the James Webb Space Telescope. I noticed the gravitational lensing. So I asked myself whether it is possible somehow a successive cluster of galaxies or black holes forming a mirror instead of a lens. Which means making light coming from our galaxy doing a U-turn. This way we can maybe observe our galaxy in the past.

Is it possible somehow that one of the galaxies in such pictures is actually the image of the Milky Way:
