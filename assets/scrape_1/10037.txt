Mass distribution in the early universe

The latest big quasar find at ~12.8 bn LJ with an estimated mass of 12 bn Mâ˜‰ (see e.g. http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530104.000-ancient-black-hole-had-an-inexplicable-growth-spurt.html) puts current black-hole-forming hypotheses into question. As the linked article explains, scientist doubt that most of the matter could pass into the hole in such a short time due to the outward pushing force of the radiation created by the material falling into it. 
My question is rather, was there enough matter in such a close vicinity of a BH that it could grow to this size? At 900 million years from the big bang I have the feeling that there is hardly enough time for the required matter to even pass through the volume around the BH where accretion can happen.
