Why celestial objects appear brighter in the night sky than in photographs from closer proximity?

The moon, for example, appears very bright in the night sky, but quite dark from photographs on/near its surface.
Similarly, Mars and Venus appear as bright dots in the sky but in closer photographs they're quite dark.
