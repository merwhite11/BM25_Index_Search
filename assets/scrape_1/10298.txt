Where is Mars in the night sky

I live around Houston, Texas and I'm taking advantage of Earth hour to look at the stars. I've found two objects that I think might be Mars. Both of them are in roughly the same plane as Venus and Jupiter. Both are closer to Venus than Jupiter. One of them has a reddish tint and is higher in the sky than Venus, and the other is closer to the horizon than venus. It is 8:50 as I type this. Is one of these Mars?
