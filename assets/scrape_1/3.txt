Amateur observing targets for binary star systems?

Are there any easily resolvable, binary star, observing targets visible from ~N40Â°?
I'd like to be able to show, in one observing session, Mizar and Alcor (naked eye resolvable), another with binoculars, and finally one in a small (say, 4 to 6" reflector) amateur scope.
