What's the farthest object as determined only by parallax?

I'm wondering what the farthest object we know of, as measured only by parallax methods, from either earth or satellite based telescopes, and at either visible light or radio wavelengths.
Basically, if we had no other way of measuring distances,
 what would be the farthest object we knew about? I'm guessing this measurement would probably be one from Gaia, it being the latest telescope to measure such things TTBOMK.
