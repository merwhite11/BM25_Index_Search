Are there any electrons inside the sun / a star?

Like the question says, are there electrons inside an active star, or has all the matter been so thoroughly ionized / plasmarized that the electrons are long gone? I ask because it would make sense when thinking about the magnetic field of a star; naked protons (neutrons are of no magnetic concern) would create a very one-way magnetic effect when circling inside the star, while protons + electrons would seem to counteract one another, magnetically.
Come to think of it, I guess the same question could be asked for the Earth's liquid core, considering its temperatures...?
