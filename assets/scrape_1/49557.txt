Why is the summer solstice night shorter than the winter solstice day?

I was looking at the sunrise and sunset times where I live (Aberdeen, Scotland) and I noticed something odd: the time between sunrise and sunset in winter is longer than the time between sunset and sunrise in summer. I chose the solstice in both cases and noticed that the summer solstice night is 6 hours and 4 minutes whereas the winter solstice day is 6 hours and 41 minutes.
The discrepancy is 37 minutes and looking for a similar ask on google I found nothing and here I could only find this question that asked why later sunsets occur than on the 21st of June and someone pointed out that the aphelion of the Earth's elliptical orbit occurs near the summer solstice, but if this was the reason for the difference, then surely it's be incredibly noticeable, and not just because we'd be missing almost an hour (and perhaps more since this barely accounts for 1/4th of the day so since I'm guessing it'd be proportional we'd have almost 3 hours of difference in day length between the two and clocks would need to be adjusted).
Thank you for the answers! (also I've added screenshots of my app showing the times because idk)
