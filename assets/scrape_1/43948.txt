Can two neighboring galaxies move apart at steady speed?

While I was trying to understand the three models that obey Friedmann's two assumptions of a non-static universe, I came across a line that says and I quote "It (referring to Big Bang) starts at time zero and eventually the galaxies are moving apart at steady speed." The question is - is it possible for two massive space bodies to move apart at a 'constant' speed? What do you say on account of the gravitational forces acting between the galaxies? And does it mean the universe will only expand and never come to rest? P.S. I am assuming 'steady' to mean 'constant'.
