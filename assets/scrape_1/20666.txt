How was Sugar Grove Station supposed to work?

Sugar Grove Station was an outpost designed to listen in on Soviet radio signals reflected off the moon.  How would this work?  Wouldn't the radio signals be distorted by the imperfect surface of the moon?  And wouldn't they also be extremely weak since they wouldn't be beamed directly at the moon?
