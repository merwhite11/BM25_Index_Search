How are planets detected from the pull their gravity exerts on their parent stars?


"The planets we have so far discovered orbiting other stars were found from the pull their gravity exerts on their
parent stars, or from the light they block from their stars when they pass in front of them"

I did not comprehend how they detected those planets by gravity
I found it in openstax textbook and I searched a lot and I did not comprehend exactly what it means.
