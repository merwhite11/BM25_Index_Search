Could a "burping" supermassive black hole be responsible for a spiral galaxy's look?

I read an article which suggests black holes could influence the production of stars in the galaxy as the black hole can burst out powerful X-rays to "snowplow" the surrounding dust and gas.
Although the article didn't suggest that spiral galaxies are made this way, I like to think that a supermassive black hole that "burps" lies in the core of every spiral galaxies. Am I mistaken?
Complementary question: does the supermassive black holes inside the Milky Way still "burp" or it is already cured?
