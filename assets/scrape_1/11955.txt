What are the most valuable meteorites and asteroids in terms of precious metals?

There were some suggestions that asteroids could one day be mined for precious metals. I have found an outdated study that says that some siderites contain as much as 0.001% of gold:

Are there recent studies on precious metals in space rocks, i.e. platinum, rhodium, iridium, rhenium, osmium, ruthenium, palladium, germanium and gold, and is it genuinely a viable mining research subject?
