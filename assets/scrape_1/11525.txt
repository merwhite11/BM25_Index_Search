Is it possible to have a part of space devoid of matter?

I have recently read this article and I am finding it a little hard to believe that there would be a place that is without matter. So, if there is a galaxy at the other side of the void, we would be unable to detect it. I am still very much a rookie at this, so please correct me if I'm wrong.

So could this article be telling the truth? 
If so, what is the science/reasoning behind this?
What if say, a black hole were to appear in such a void, what would happen?
