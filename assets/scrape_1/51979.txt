How does the Chandrasekhar limit relate to the ignition of carbon in white dwarf stars?

Why carbon in white dwarfs ignites (deflagrate, detonate) at the Chandrasekhar limit? The limit relates stability of the star made of degenerate electron Fermi gas to the white dwarf mass without a word about chemical identity of the atomic nuclei. How is that carbon ignites at (or around) the limit?
