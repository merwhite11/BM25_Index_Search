Explosion event of IRAS 05506+2414?

From NASA's September 23, 2022 Hubble Unveils an Astronomical Explosion:

A shroud of thick gas and dust surrounds a bright young star in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 inspected a young stellar object, over 9,000 light-years away in the constellation Taurus, to help astronomers understand the earliest stages in the lives of massive stars. This object – which is known to astronomers as IRAS 05506+2414 – may be an example of an explosive event caused by the disruption of a massive young star system.

What "disruption" really happened? Assuming it exploded, why and how? The article unfortunately provides no other details of what happened.
