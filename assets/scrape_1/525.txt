What Causes the Large Radiation Fields Around Jupiter?

I had heard that the large radiation belts around Jupiter may be formed by liquid metallic hydrogen in (or around) Jupiter's core (which Wikipedia says haven't been observed in labs yet due to the immense pressure required), but I don't understand how the liquid metallic hydrogen can form a planetary magnetic field. The article also says that the hydrogen can act as a conductor, is this somehow related to moving electric fields forming magnetic fields?
