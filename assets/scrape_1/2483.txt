How big would a disc have to be to blot out the sun covering 5% of the land mass of earth?

Like this, but floating in space.

I imagine that this would also be influenced by the distance of the object from the sun, and that there is some ideal distance for this object to be? (and obviously the distance of the Earth from the Sun as well)
