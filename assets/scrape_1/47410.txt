What is a photoelectric scanner?

I am reading this article by  Wing, Peimbert and Spinrad, where they mention the use of a photoelectric scanner. By searching online, I find that photoelectric scanners are used to scan punchcards, but I doubt this is the kind of device that they are referring to.
What is a photoelectric scanner? How is it used and what does it do? What does it look like?
