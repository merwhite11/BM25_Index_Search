Has the Lyman-alpha forest ever been used to test Arp's theory?

Has the Lyman-alpha forest ever been used to test Halton Arp's theory that quasars are not cosmological but instead are ejected from relatively near-by galaxies?  If Arp was right, then the spectra of the quasar and the 'parent galaxy' should both show the same Lyman-alpha forest; if it only appears in the quasar spectra, then the quasar must be much further away.
