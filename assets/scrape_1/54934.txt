Error in "Efficient Method for Calculating the time of Sunrise and Sunset" by Robin G Stuart

I've been implementing this paper in python.
"Efficient Method for Calculating the time of Sunrise and Sunset" by Robin G Stuart.
The sun's equation of centre is incorrect no matter what I try.
it's
$\nu - M = 0.3342 \sin (l + 1.3450)$
where l is the sun's mean longitude.
Where does this equation come from, and is it correct?
