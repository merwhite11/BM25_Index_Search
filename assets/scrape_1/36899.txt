What's the critical mass of a rocky planet before its gravity traps enough gas in its atmosphere to start becoming a gassy planet

Looking at the latest theories, I've noticed that most rocky planets are below a certain mass range. I speculate that maybe the way gas giants and gas dwarfs form is a rocky planet during the planetary formation phase of its history accumulates enough mass to begin gaining a hydrogen atmosphere that keeps building until it's no longer a rocky planet.
What would be the critical mass of a rocky planet before it would start down the path of becoming a gassy planet?
