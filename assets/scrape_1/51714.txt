The shape of the moon limb/crescent (terminator line)

Given that that n% of the moon is illuminated. I want to (approximately, but more or less correctly) draw the the terminator line on the circle (that represents the moon). Orientation is not the case here, just the crescent shape.
What is the best/correct way to determine/calculate/approximate the shape of the terminator line? Is this line actually a chord of a circle, or it is something different?
