Convert image from Jy/sr to Jy/pix

I want to convert the units of an image from Jy/sr (Janskys per steradian) to Jy/pix and I know the pixel scale in arcsec. The way I do this, in python, is the following:
from astropy import units

pixel_scale = 0.05 # NOTE: in arcsec

conversion_factor = 1.0 / (units.steradian.to(units.arcsec**2.0) / pixel_scale**2.0)

image_in_Jy_per_pix = image_in_Jy_per_sr * conversion_factor

Is this correct?
