why does earth have speed?

I understand that Earth has a quite big speed such as it ends up around the orbit. The sun can't really attract it till the end due to Earth's speed and earth really can't escape due to gravity, hence, it ends up in an orbit.
I'm wondering about 2 questions.

Why does the earth have the speed at all ? I understand everything as long as I presume that earth has big speed, but where does this speed come from and why ?

Why doesn't the speed decrease ? Since gravity of sun tries to pull it, each time, it should be causing the earth to slow down, eventually stop it and pull it, but maybe earth always has this speed. If I had a car with an engine, I'd understand as engine gives car a speed and it can always give the same speed without decreasing, but why does earth keep having the same speed(well, not maybe the same speed, but it really doesn't decrease that much).
