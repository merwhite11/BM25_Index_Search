What do gravitational waves allow us to understand?

Before reading this question, you should read this paper.
From what I understood, we managed to detect gravitational waves for the first time.
Is this discovery going to help us understand something we haven't understood yet? Dark matter? Galaxy movements? FTL travel? Gravity manipulation, Interstellar style?
Though I understand the discovery, I'm a little confused about what it will actually improve for science.
So, what are the doors this discovery will open ?
