How did LIGO verify that the gravitational waves originated 1.3 billion years ago from two specific black hole collision?

So they finally found gravitational waves.  That's cool and I trust is the case, but how did they confirm it originated 1.3 billion years ago and that two blackholes merging caused it and what distance it came from? 
I am not sure if the extent of variation in the laser wavelength can tell us all this above information.. 
Any clues ?
