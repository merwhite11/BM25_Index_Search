Pulsars: How do astronomers measure minute changes in period (~picoseconds per year)?

I've been to some talks that mention how stable the period of a millisecond pulsar is over long periods of time. Recently, it was mentioned that astronomers have calculated the change in period over time to be less than 10^-12 seconds per year for several pulsars. No one I've talked to seems to know any details of this calculation.
How do we calculate such small differences in period? How much data must be collected and what are the exposure times for imaging such rapid phenomena?
A source/paper would be excellent. I apologize that I don't have a citation for the 10^-12s figure, but the lack of citation is mostly my reason for posting this question.
