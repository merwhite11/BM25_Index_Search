Meade 4000 'LP' designation


I have a Meade 4000 super Plossl 26mm eyepiece in front of me with an 'LP' mark on it. I am a fan of the Meade 4000 series, but this is the first time I see this variant.
It looks like it stands for 'low profile', how is this achieved, are the optics any different, or is this just a barrel difference?
More importantly, if one has the choice, is there any advantage to using the LP or plain variants?
