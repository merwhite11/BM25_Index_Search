How to derive Kepler's 1st Law?

I was going through the derivation of Kepler's 1st Law in the textbook "An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics" by Carroll and Ostlie. From there, I got stuck in a few places in their derivation as I found it confusing. In total, I have 2 questions.

Q1: In the second sentence that I highlighted, it is mentioned that when equation 29 is translated into a physical standpoint, it implies that "both objects in a binary orbit move about the centre of mass in ellipses, with the centre of mass occupying one focus of each ellipse" however I don't see how the physical implications of equation 29 will translate into this that they claim. This equation clearly only describes the position vector of the reduced mass, so how can it be extrapolated to talk about the motion of a binary system when there are 2 masses rather than 1 reduced mass. (Clarification: I am aware that reduced mass is a way to model binary systems, but in this case I don't see the link between the motion of the reduced mass and the motion of 2 bodies)
Q2: On the very last line, it is mentioned that "L is at minimum as eccentricity approaches unity, as expected". However I don't see the qualitative reasoning as to why this would be "expected". Is there a physical or physics explanation as to why we expect an orbit with a large eccentricity to have a lower angular momentum than one with a low eccentricity?
