Explaining Dark Matter and Dark Energy to layman

With my little knowledge, I know this:
Dark Matter
The center of a galaxy controls/attracts its objects (stars, planets, comets etc.) towards itself because of gravity. But the mass of the center of this galaxy appears to be less than what it should take to attract all objects of the galaxy. Hence Dark Matter is there, which makes this attraction or controlling possible.
Dark Energy
This is the force which is pulling galaxies away from each other, and hence making the universe expand. If we don't have this hypothetical force, we cannot explain why distances between galaxies are increasing.
Question
Please let me know how far I am from the actual meaning/definition of these terms? And how can I explain these to a layman, who has no or very little knowledge about astronomy?
Thanks.
P.S.: I have read this question here, which is excellent but I could not get an idea of how to explain to a layman.
