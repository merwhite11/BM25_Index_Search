Given that gravity bends the path of light, how confident can we be that galaxies are where they seem to be?

The widely known phenomenon termed gravitational lensing is believed to curve space, thereby affecting the path followed by light and other electromagnetic waves.
This effect is associated principally with galaxies and galaxy clusters, as it requires considerable mass. But in theory any star or star cluster, or black hole, can have this effect to some degree.
What can we tell for sure about the position of external galaxies, if we are uncertain that their light is actually coming to us along a straight path: i.e. if light follows the curvature of space, and that curvature is not uniform, how can we be sure we are not observing, for example, the light from a single source appearing to us as more than one object.
Can a galaxy appear to be in more than one place in the sky?
