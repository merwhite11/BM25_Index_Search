Determine the moons of Jupiter through a telescope

I was doing my own "space exploration" last night with a telescope. Being a space noob I can't visually determine stars or planets (I know the moon, though), but I focused on one particularly bright one when I saw 4 smaller "stars" on each side. After a quick Google I learned I had discovered the moons of Jupiter!

I now know the moons I could see were Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. But which is which?
Is there an easy way to determine which Galilean moon is which?
