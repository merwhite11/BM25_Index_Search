We are sure that there are no brown dwarfs closer than ______

I don't quite know how to word this question.
How close could a brown dwarf be to us and have gone undetected until now?
Or maybe, with what probability are we sure that there is no brown dwarf within X light years of the sun? (For different values of X)
(Don't worry about addressing Nemesis or a hypothetical binary partner for the sun. I'm just asking about undetected brown dwarfs..., even outside of the Oort cloud but within Alpha C. I don't know how sensitive the WISE survey was.)
