Would it have been possible to send a radio signal towards ʻOumuamua?

As we could not get any radio signals from asteroid ʻOumuamua, couldn't we have sent a powerful radio signal to it and then check if we can get any radio signal in response?
This way we can at least check if it is just a rock or any alien spaceship. If it were an alien spacecraft, then they should definitely give a radio signal in response I believe.
