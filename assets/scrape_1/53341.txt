Formation of a non-Sol Oort cloud with high mass planets

Based on recent developments in astronomy, pertaining to a greater degree of measurement, the mass of the Oort cloud around Sol is apparently only about 1.5 times the mass of earth,in contrast to over a thousand times, roughly, as previous thought, which got me wondering, if there might be a scenario where an Oort cloud would have substantial mass, and moreover, would consist of planets full on planets rather than our's which consits of a handful of planetoids and a whole lot of comets.
I know the field(of astronomy) is currently evolving, and there's a great deal of unknown aspects regarding the formation of solar systems but one idea I do have is, planetoids drifting through an outer system and being captured upon the stars initial formation, with an outer system with a rather high density of interstellar gas, and so encouraging the formation of said planets.
