Martian Brother

According to some documentaries History and Discovery, fossils have been found in a meteorite that fell to earth. This meteorite came from Mars.
It is possible that the Martians always try to be bacteria or unicellular. It is possible that single-celled organisms that evolved into multicellular beings and then to beings we know.
So possibly we are Martians (acestral have a Martian, a bacterium).
My question is, does on Mars, before the earth existed humans?
If that were to be existed underground, or another planet were extinct?
If there were other humans on Mars, then we live in parallel ignorance of each other. So we may be extinct before meeting our Martian (or other planets now) brother?
Have we discovered but scare our discoverers by our violent attitudes and our boundless ambition?
