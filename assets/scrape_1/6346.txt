Selecting a Telescope for Viewing Planets

I hope to observe planets like Jupiter and Saturn, and moons. I am a novice when it comes to telescopes and I know images in magazines are not taken with at least 12-inch telescope in a middle of nowhere. Is it possible to view Saturn in little yellowish and Mars in little reddish using following telescopes?  I am going to buy one of them. Which one is worth more for the money with the price difference?
I am living in Sri Lanka (a country close to the equator) in a suburban city.
