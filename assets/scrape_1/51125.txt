Limits of the universe

I am considering the limit in the expanding universe where the expansion matches the speed of light.
If we consider that the expansion is accelerating, how will the situation be after the next 14 billion years. i.e. after doubling the age of the universe?
Will the distance to this limit not shrink and perhaps come nearer the Hubble limit which I assume have doubled at that time?
I am thinking in newtonian terms so I may have it all wrong.
