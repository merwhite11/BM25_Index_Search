Are these facts about moon true?

I don't have much knowledge of Astronomy but today I was googling randomly and found an article, according to which:


The moon is of the wrong size for its current orbit.
The moon rings like a bell when hit by an object, which could signal that it's hollow.
Metal shavings were found in samples taken by the Apollo crew. 
UFO sightings were common on NASA moon missions.
All these phenomena and more point toward the suggestion that the moon is actually an artificially created spaceship. It's a bit far fetched, but it's odd that astronomers have been discouraged from testing this theory.


Can this theory be true?
