Where do the heavier elements come from?

Partly inspired by this question, the end result of stellar fusion is Iron-56 (eventually, after some decay). Then it explodes. How/where then to the heavier elements come from. The answer here mentioned two colliding stars form gold. What process is taking place to form this gold (and I'd assume the rest of the heavier elements)?
