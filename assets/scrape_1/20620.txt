Changing Appearance of the Moon During a Single Night

I have noticed that the inclination of the moon at a given location varies throughout the night. From the UK, the terminator in a half-moon is clearly sloping from top left to bottom right early in the evening, but later on, as the moon is setting, it is clearly sloping from top right to bottom left. I know that the shape of the moon changes from night to night, but I just can't see why the inclination would change during a single night. I know that the appearance of the moon is due to a combination of the tilt of the earth's axis and the latitude of my position (the moon slopes oppositely in the southern hemisphere), but I just can't visualise in three dimensions exactly what is going on. Please can you help me to do this.
