Need help finding a star

I've tried utilizing "Google Sky", however, once I've found the location of said star and am in the process of zooming in, the site craps out. 
Anyway... if there's someone out there with a little more experience in this field, here are the coordinates of the star i'm searching for: 
10h 10m 11.1s, +4 3' 12.3"  
I'd appreciate the effort, and thank's in advance.
