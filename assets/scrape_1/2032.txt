How would an exoplanet be found from earth if our view of its star system is "from the top"?

When we find an exoplanet by observing the dimming of its parent star, this means that the planet passes in front of the star from our view.
What if our view of a star system is from its "top" or "bottom"? Then from our view, none of its planets would pass in front of the star so we could observe a dimming. How would we know, then, whether such a star has or doesn't have planets?
