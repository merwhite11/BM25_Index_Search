Will the 2016 Perseid meteor shower be visible in Sydney, Australia?

As the title states, will viewers in Sydney, Australia be able to see the Perseid meteor shower in August, 2016? Assume the viewer is well outside of the city and light pollution is a minimal problem.
According to Australian Geographic, the event will be visible in the northern parts of the country – specifically, "head north for the best chance to witness the event" – but it is not clear whether it will be possible to see anything in the southern parts.
If any viewing is possible, what would be the recommended dates and time of night to see the most?
