Is it correct to say vertical conjunction?

This question is related to this one: Are we seeing a conjunction these mornings?
Last Feb 27, the a reporter said that, the day before, at sunset, Venus and the Moon were in vertical conjunction. Is that correct?
Sorry, but I cannot understand the meaning of near conjunction.
