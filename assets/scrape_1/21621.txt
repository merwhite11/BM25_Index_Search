Moving light in night sky

Today at about 2 am I have spotted a light very similar (perceived speed and apparent brightness, motion due East) to ISS. At very first I thought to have spotted the station but immediately I doubted about as I feel that the observation time is too far from sunrise. ISS is indeed ruled out as there is not email from the spot the station service in my inbox. Can satellites orbiting at higher orbits be see even in deep night?  I feel that answers is yes based on simple geometry. However what could reflect so much light? I think there are not objects with reflecting surface so big to be compared to those of ISS...
