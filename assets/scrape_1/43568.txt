Given that a color index ($B-V$) of star A is lower than that of Star B, What can we say about the stars?

The color index $B-V$ of the star is defined as
$$B-V\equiv M_B-M_V$$
Let us suppose it's given
$$(B-V)^{(A)}<(B-V)^{(B)}\Rightarrow M_B^A-M_V^A>M^B_B-M^B_V$$
The notations are a bit confusing, but I think you would pardon me.
Now we know that Stellar magnitudes decrease with increasing brightness which means a star with absolute magnitude $-5$ will be brighter than a star with absolute magnitude $-2$.
I'm reading Introduction to Modern Astrophysics By Carroll and Ostlie. The  author says,

A star with a smaller $B-V$ color index is bluer than a star with a larger value of $B-V$.

I don't understand, How??
Star A is bluer than Star B means
$$M_B^A<M_B^B$$
Given four numbers with relation
$$x-y<a-b\not\Rightarrow x<a$$
Then how we can say so??
