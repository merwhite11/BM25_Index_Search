In the end what is the ultimate matter/element in the universe, due to fusion process in stars?

We know that, in stars, hydrogen is used by the stars and due to the fusion in two hydrogen elements we get helium -> Carbon -> Oxygen ->Other elements -> Iron -> then Super/Hypernova.
If everywhere hydrogen is getting converted to other element then will we(universe) have hydrogen to create/retain stars ? 
Or in the end what is the ultimate matter in the universe ?
