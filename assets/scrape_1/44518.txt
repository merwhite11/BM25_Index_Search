Details about the next big comet 2014 UN271?

The announcent of the massive trans-Neptunian object 2014 UN271 to be a comet is rather new (June 22nd, 2021) and really exciting. That comet is rather huge (~100km diameter) and "falling toward the sun for a 'approach' outside the orbit of Saturn in early 2031." (citing the spaceweather.com-newsletter from today).
The name of the object suggests that it has been first observed in 2014, but do I understand it correctly that only now we learned that the object is outgasing therefore deserves the classification "comet"?
Its perihelion of 10.95 AU will occur in late January 2031. Will it be more impressive to observe than Halley in February 1986? Halley's perihelion was 0.586 AU, but it has only 11km diameter, so I am wondering how much bigger (or smaller) 2014UN271 will appear for the observer on Earth.
