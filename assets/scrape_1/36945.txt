How do I calculate the surface temperature of a star from luminosity?

How do I calculate the surface temperature of a star from luminosity? I've been trying to delve into speculative solar systems for a bit, and I've heard the surface temperature of a star can be calculated from its brightness, but I can't find any ways to do that! Is it even possible to do so?
