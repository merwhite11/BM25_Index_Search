Why are tides biggest during the equinoxes?

I've read that during the equinoxes, tides are at their maximum. Shouldn't this only apply to latitudes near the equator? I mean, when the solar declination is near to 0ยบ and we have a full or new moon, the combined effect of the Sun's and Moon's gravity should create the highest tides, but only near the equator (see in wikipedia the article Tides, which says that equinoctial tides are maximum)
Is this true for other latitudes?
