Using Einsteinpy to plot the precession of a star orbiting a black hole?

I am currently trying to code the precession of a star orbiting around a black hole, the issue I am having though is that I have no clue what the values are and what they mean in the code, if anyone would know what the values mean I would appreciate the help. Here's the code I have currently and here's a link to Einsteinpy's website thank you

    import numpy as np

from einsteinpy.geodesic import Timelike
from einsteinpy.plotting.geodesic import GeodesicPlotter

position = [40., np.pi / 2, 0.]
momentum = [0., 0., 3.83405]
a = 1.
steps = 5500
delta = 1.

geod = Timelike(
    metric="Schwarzschild",
    metric_params=(a,),
    position=position,
    momentum=momentum,
    steps=steps,
    delta=delta,
    return_cartesian=True
)


gpl = GeodesicPlotter()
gpl.plot(geod)
gpl.show()
