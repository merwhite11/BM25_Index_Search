Collision of two Earths

Assume that two Earth-like planets orbited the same star, with elliptic orbits. Eventually, something occurs that caused the two planets to collide. 
What would be the outcome of such a catastrophe? I figure that both planets (and any life if it exists) would be destroyed, but exactly how? 
Would both planets explode, combine together into a larger planet, or be able to rebound and either reestablish an orbit or be pulled into the sun?
