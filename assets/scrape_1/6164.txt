Why aren't there galaxy-sized balls of iron out there?

Since we know that stars burn out, collapse, or blow up when too many of their atoms fuse into iron, then how come, with all the ancient galaxies we've been observing, there isn't one galaxy whose stars have become giant balls of iron, which would eventually collide into one galaxy-sized iron globule in space?
