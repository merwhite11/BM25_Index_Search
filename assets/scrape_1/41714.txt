How should I interpret this result obtained using lomb scargle?

I used lomb scargle for periodic analysis.
The time interval used is constant at 500 seconds.

#My data (x=time, y=intensity values) is :
x= (
00:28,
00:37,
00:45,
00:53,
01:02,
01:10,
01:19,
01:27,
01:36,
01:45,
01:53,
02:01,
02:11,
02:19  )
y=(18264.682317  ,18720.708081  ,18476.409461  ,19592.046320
,19166.021184 , 18984.852405 , 20971.112057  ,20946.024653
21590.194169 , 21771.175308 , 21474.776018 , 20156.969939
21688.756080 , 22570.152358  )
--> The time interval of x data is equal to 500 seconds.
and lomb scargle code is:
frequency,power = LombScargle(x,y).autopower(nyquist_factor=1)
ax.plot(frequency,power,'-')
        #ax4.axvline(x=best_frequency)
ax.set_ylabel('(4-2) band R‚ÇÅ(2.5) Intensity - Lomb Scargle Power')


How should I interpret the lomb scargle results shown in the picture(below picture)?

Why does the maximum appear near zero(below picture)?
