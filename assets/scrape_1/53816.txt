How did people in Mali know that there were two stars appearing as one in Sirius before telescopes were invented?

Did they invent a telescope and keep it quiet?
Given that glass has been around for 4000 years (made in mesopotamia in 2000 BC) was it technically possible to polish it and make convex shapes from it a long time ago?
