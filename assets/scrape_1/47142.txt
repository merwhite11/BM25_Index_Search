How else can a star form, other than gravitational collapse?

I read this paragraph on the Sun's page on Wikipedia:

[The Sun] formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.

Notice how it says, "almost all stars form by this process"? It says "almost all". Does it mean that there are other ways by which a star can form? I mean, other than the gravitational collapse of gas and dust?
