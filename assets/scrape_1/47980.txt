How long would it take to realize there are "star-like objects" (i.e. planets) that change position in respect to the "fixed stars"?

If you were using unaided observations and were unfamiliar with astronomy (and maybe just pen and paper for recording anything), how long should it take to notice that Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn move independently of the "fixed stars"? Would some planets be easier or harder to notice than others? I assume that Jupiter and Saturn would be somewhat difficult because they move so slowly and Mercury might be difficult to make observations of at all, but that is just my naive first impression.
