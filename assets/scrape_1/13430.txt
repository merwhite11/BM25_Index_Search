Terminology: Is there a name for the points on the surfaces of tidally locked parent/satellite bodies that always face each other?

This is purely a question about terminology, one that has eluded my googling efforts. 
When a satellite and its parent body are tidally locked to each other, there is (in an ideal case) a single point on the surface of the parent body and on the surface of the satellite body that remain the closest two points on the two bodes at all times.
Is there a specific name for those two points? If so, what is it? I think "antipodal points" is descriptive, but I wonder if there is a more specific term.
Thank you!
