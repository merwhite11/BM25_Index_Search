Stars in constellation patterns by catalogue number?

I need a resource that can tell me the stars that make up a constellation (pattern), preferably by Henry Draper or some catalogue number? All i can find is lists of every star in a constellation (area) or incomplete lists of stars by name.
If this doesn't exist can you suggest a way to work it out myself?
