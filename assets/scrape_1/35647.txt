Galaxies stay at same place but it's the space that splits the galaxies apart

Galaxies stay at same place but it's the space that splits the galaxies apart. Is my understanding correct?
As per my understanding. Galaxies moving apart at high speed is due to the increase in space between the galaxies (i.e. new space is created between galaxies that push the galaxies apart). That's why it's said that every point in universe is center of the universe because after bigbang space has been created between galaxies and it started splitting the galaxies away. 
Is my understanding correct?
