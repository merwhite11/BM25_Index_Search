Why doesn't the Sun wobble towards Jupiter instead of away from Jupiter?

This is the page I am referring to. It seems counterintuitive to me that the Sun should be on the opposite side of the barycenter's wobble.  I realize I am wrong, but I cannot see why I am wrong.  Can someone explain why the wobble is away from Jupiter, not towards Jupiter?
Here is an unedited screenshot of the NASA animation - it shows the sun on the opposite side of the green line (barycenter) as Jupiter.

My logic says, since gravity is in play here, the Sun and Jupiter should be on the same side of the green line.   I have edited NASA's image in MS Paint to show what I think should be happening:
