Would a Phobos full impact make Mars temporary habitable?

Due to tidal deceleration, Phobos is predicted to be destroyed by Mars in the next 30-50 million years either by collision or by breaking up in a planetary ring. If Phobos falls on Mars in one piece could the impact could be comparable with Chicxulub meteorite? Since Mars is smaller that Earth, would the effects of the impact cause a global restart of volcanic activity and temporary warm the planet? Would this be sufficient to make Mars more friendly to life for a few thousand years?
