Can we see the Big Bang happen if we look far enough?

The observable universe is constantly expanding as more light from the Big Bang reaches us. This light has been travelling for billions of years, so we are looking at the universe as it was a few billion years ago. This being said, would it be possible to look at the Big Bang in action by looking deep into the universe?
