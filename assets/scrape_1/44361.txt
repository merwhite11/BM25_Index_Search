Moon's rotation and revolution

Since the moon's period of rotation around its own axis, and that of its revolution around earth is (almost) same, we always see only one side of moon. This is what was, & is taught in schools. The question is: When and How did we (humans) realized that the moon is also rotating around its own axis? Was this known before the first man-made object touched moon soil?
