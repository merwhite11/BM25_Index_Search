seasons elongating and shortening

I have heard of years with longer summers and winters and shorter springs and falls and vice versa because of a change in the earths axis.
Is this from the procession that causes the season switch every 25,800 years or is it from some other change in the earth's axis like angle change and not revolution at the same angle(which I think the procession is)?
