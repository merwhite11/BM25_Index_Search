What is a dM1e red dwarf star? What do the '1' and 'e', specifically, stand for?

The Castor-and-Pollux Gemini Dioscuri system contains several red dwarfs classified as type 'dM1e' stars.
I believe the d is dwarf, the M is M-type (redundantly designating a red dwarf?).
What do the '1' and 'e', specifically, stand for?
