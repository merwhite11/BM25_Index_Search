Oscillation in tilt of the solar system

I know that the solar system is tilted 62.6Â° to the plane of the galaxy.  I'm curious whether this angle changes over time, and what are the extents and time frame of any such oscillations if they exist?
Upon reflection, I'm assuming that since such an oscillation would require a change in the overall angular momentum of the entire solar system, and that would necessitate a collective re-orientation of the orbit of every planet, dwarf planet, SSSB, etc. related to the Sun that it's unlikely that any such mechanism exists?
