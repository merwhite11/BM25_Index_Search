Shadows of Light = Space or Dark Matter?

Perhaps my title is misleading. but here is my understanding and I'm looking for confirmation.
You cannot have dark without light.
The only thing faster than light is darkness (i.e. shadows)
Stars are in the galaxy and are inherently bright.
Does this make "dark matter" mere shadows of extremely bright objects?
Is that also why it has to get dark before we can really see the majority of stars (subjective experience)?
Update:
With all due respect to user with answer below and thank you for taking the time to answer... I think this can be expanded on.
I have provided a source for my claims: youtu.be/JTvcpdfGUtQ 
Check out the video, and it more explains my understanding of things...
Why I don't accept answer below:
Can you provide sources for your claims?
Also I didn't say you can't have DARK MATTER without Light , I said you can't have Dark, as in Darkness. I think you're getting hung up on Dark Matter which is a big part of my question, but not the entire question.
Also, are you claiming that all darkness in space is dark matter? I don't like to assume but for scientific purposes (not an accredited scientist) would we not agree that the measures made on dark matter were on a sample, and not the entire universe?
So to further question this, do shadows not exist in space?
