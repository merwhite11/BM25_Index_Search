Could Mercury be a some kind of Chthonian?

A recent news article mentioned that Mercury has an unusually large core - meaning it is denser than the other rocky planets in the solar system.
It made me wonder if Mercury could have started as an ice or gas planet in the outer solar system, and then migrated in towards the sun, becoming a hot-[Jupiter,Neptune,whatever] and evaporating off its outer layers.
How feasible is such a scenario?
The best answer would probably address how big the original Mercury would have been, and how well (or likely poorly) such a planet's migration would fit with our existing planetary development models.
