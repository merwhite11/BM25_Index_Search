If I had a horseshoe orbit of two moons...

Consider an Earth-like planet, with two moons. I guess the two moons would have to be smaller than our own, for the system to be stable. Is that stable? I did some research, and apparently Janus and Epimetheus (Saturn moons that are in a horseshoe orbit) are like that, but I don't know how their cycles work, or how they look from Saturn. 
Hence,: 

Would a moon have to be smaller that the other one, or would both have to be the same size? 
Would both have the same cycle? 
How could nights be seen from the Earth? 

I'm looking for that sort of answer. 
Thanks in advance! :)
