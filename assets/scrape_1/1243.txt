Good Introductory Textbooks

I have a more mathematical background but have always been interested in astrophysics, cosmology, astronomy, etc. There are a lot of popular books on the subject, but I am getting more interested in looking at a more rigorous approach to it.
What are the best introductory textbooks on the subject? (Calculus+ and assuming introductory courses in Mechanics and Heat and Electricity and Magnetism, etc.)
