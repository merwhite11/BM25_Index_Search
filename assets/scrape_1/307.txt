What is there in the intergalactic space?

What bodies can be encountered way outside galaxies - far beyond the farthest edges of galaxies, in the deep space between them? Are there single, galaxy-less stars, giant clouds of gas more dense than that the lower-than-elsewhere content of free hydrogen in space, or any other phenomena that span the void between the galaxies?
