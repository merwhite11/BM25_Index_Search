Are Barlow Lenses Good For Deep Sky Observing?

I'm using a 750mm (focal length) by 150mm (aperture) newtonian reflector and I've been curious about using Barlow lenses on deep sky objects. 
Some of the astronomers at my local observatory say that if you get the lens selection correct so you don't lose any light through the eyepiece, you don't need a Barlow lens. While others say that the Barlow lens doubling the focal length of the telescope allows me to see deep sky objects better than without it. 
So, is a Barlow lens an effective tool for deep sky observing? If not, what should I use it for?
Note: I already have a 2x Barlow lens.
