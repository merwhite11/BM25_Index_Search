Have we detected galaxies which have red-shifted beyond the visible light range?

According to this answer it is possible for galaxies' light to move beyond the visible frequencies due to redshift:

It is possible that eventually the light from them could move into the infrared and even
the microwave in extreme cases

Could this have already happened?  Have we already looked for it?  Is there a telescope with the instrumentation to detect galaxies' 'light' at these wavelengths?
