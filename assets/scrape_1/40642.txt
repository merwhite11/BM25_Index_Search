Comparing Star Formation rate in different galaxies

I was looking for some scale to compare my result of star formation rate in order to find out whether it is moderate or high or low, but I couldn't find any scale. Is there any paper related to such scale where Star formation rate form minimum to maximum of each galaxy is given and once can compare their result with scale.
I found that one of dwarf galaxies has 0.2 star formation rate, but since I don't have scale to compare, thus I have no clue whether it is high or low or moderate? What is the maximum star formation rate?
