How can a busy high school student get into learning Astronomy?

I'm a high school student that has loved physics for quite some time, but have only started dabbling with the more complex things. I know a fair bit about quantum mechanics and such as I like it, but a documentary I watched a couple months ago sparked my interest in Astronomy. I'm currently reading the OpenStax textbook on Astronomy (still fairly at the start) and want to learn more. I know a bit of general relativity (intuition and some basic math), and as for my mathematical background I know trigonometry and a fair bit of single variable calculus. As I'm doing the IB diploma I do not have much free time, but the little I have I'm ready to devote to Astronomy and Astrophysics. Thank you!
