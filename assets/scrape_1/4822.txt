Why there are three equations governing blackbody emission?

I learnt that the spectrum of a black body can be explained using

Planck distribution
Rayleigh -Jeans equation and
Weins displacement law

Can anyone tell me why there are three different equations that explain the same physical phenomena and when should I consider which equation?
