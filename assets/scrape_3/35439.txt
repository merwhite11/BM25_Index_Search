Martian dust storms-what was the smallest in area, or shortest in duration storm detected?

I understand localized Martian dust storms can develop into global wide events. All searches I do produce results that focus on local storms expanding.  Is there any information on what was the shortest duration or smallest area dust storm recorded?
