Moving lights in the sky looks like they were moving coordinated

I was out with a couple friends a night and we looked up to the sky just watching the stars. I noticed what looked like a star moving then told my friends and they saw it too. 
After we saw the one moving star we noticed 2 more, it seriously looked like 3 stars just decided to have a meeting. It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen
