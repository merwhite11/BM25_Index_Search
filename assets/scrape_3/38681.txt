Celestron Nexstar 102GT

Good day folks.
My Grandson would like to start using this Telescope Celestron Nexstar GT102, has been in the basement for years, and unfortunately, we appear to have misplaced the eyepieces.
Just wondering if anyone had any insight what would be a reasonable eyepiece for me to buy so he can see the moon at the very least decently enough.
Also, would Amazon be a good start for eyepieces that way I can get them fairly cheap and quick.
Thanks in advance
