Stability of solar system

My question is simple:  

Is the Solar system stable? 

You can see this Wikipedia page.
Edit: Sorry, because i think my question is more about mathematics and classical mechanics of planets in billion years scale, than astronomy. But i think this is our fortuity that Earth didn't doomed in past billion years ago and it's possible that we will have less than 8 planet's before Sun will be ruin.
