What keeps Chthonian planets so dense?

The cores of gas giants are kept under incredible pressure by the weight of the gasses of the giant. In a chthonian planet, said gases are stripped away, revealing the core of the gas giant, which should alleviate the pressure compressing the core of the gas giant. In a chthonian planet candidate, Kepler 52-c, its density is over 600 times that of Jupiter. What is keeping the planet at such a high density?
