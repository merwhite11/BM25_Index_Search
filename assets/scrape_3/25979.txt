Star formation around rotating black holes?

Please excuse an amateur question. 
While trying to think of anything but what was happening during a dental procedure my mind turned to a model of a star close to a rotating black hole and the effects on the drawn in matter. 
While it is obvious such matter would be excited to high temperature could the combination of rotation and excitation be enough to induce a sustained fusion reaction?
If so would this produce enough energy to maintain a fusion 'ring' at the event horizon - essentially a doughnut star?
Would there be enough of a reaction to start producing lighter elements?
Pure curiosity generated by an attempt to distract myself
