Could Earth have been seeded with life?

The earliest life on Earth is thought to have began shortly after its formation (a few hundred million years after, by fossil evidence, and this while the late heavy bombardment was raging). With the next discernible leap (eukaryotes) happening billions of years later, That seems like a very short timeframe for life to spontaneously develop. Is it possible that life was seeded on an early Earth by a supernova of an earlier, life-bearing star, blasting living material across the cosmos?
