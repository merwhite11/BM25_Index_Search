Is it plausible for a planet that is positioned in the habitable area of a solar system to have little extractable metals?

I am big fan of Asimov's Foundation and I am wondering about the plausibility of some of Foundation's imagined words.
According to this article Terminus was a special world with little metals:

It was the sole planet orbiting its isolated star and had almost no
  metals. The nearest planet was Anacreon, 8 parsecs (26 light years)
  away. Being on the fringe of the galaxy, there are almost no stars in
  the sky.

Since the planet hosted the first Foundation it is clearly habitable (i.e. atmosphere, no extreme temperatures). However, I am wondering how could it have so little metals if it seems so similar to Earth (habitability-wise) which has lots of metals. Is this possible in our Universe? 
I am interested in answers that use current discovered exoplanets information or some articles that deal with planets come to be.
