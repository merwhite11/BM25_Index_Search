How does the surface gravity on Mars vary between the equator and its poles?

A day on Mars is similar in length to the Earth's day. On Earth, due to rotation, the surface gravity varies from 9.78 m/s² (0.997 g) on the equator to 9.832 m/s² (1.003 g) on  the poles. I wonder how the gravity varies on Mars where the day is of similar length. We hear of different values, such as 3.69, 3.711 or 3.72076 m/s². All values around 0.38 g. But I wonder what is the exact value of the equatorial gravity on Mars (including centrifugal forces), what it's on the midlatitudes and on the poles. 
The Phoenix probe landed near the north pole; do we know whether it has a gravimeter and measured the surface gravity on its landing place? I know the Curiosity rover which landed close to the equator measured a gravity of around 3.71 m/s² from which I conclude the 3.711 value is for the equator (0.378 g).
When I calculate the gravity of Mars with (G x m)/r² it doesn't include the centrifugal force of Mars' rotation.
