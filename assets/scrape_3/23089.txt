How is the total mass of all the Solar System's small asteroids and meteoroids estimated?

This diagram from wikipedia (shown below) graphs asteroid Diameter against Number of asteroids, for the Solar System.  (Graphic is courtesy of the Marco Colombo, DensityDesign Research Lab).
Presumably the Diameter data for the larger asteroids is strongly supported by observations.  But for progressively smaller bodies direct observational data is presumably less available.
The pattern shows a strong, but not perfect, linear inverse correlation between log(Diameter ) and log(Number).  This seems quite reasonable for large bodies. It also sounds plausible that such a pattern continues into the realm of small asteroids and meteoroids.  
But what is the physical justification for extending the log:log pattern into the realm of small bodies which are too small to see from Earth?  Presumably the current estimate of the total mass of the Astroid Belt (4% of the mass of the Moon) is consistent with this distribution model.  But can we confidently rule out the possibility that the linear log:log pattern breaks down for small objects allowing, for example, a much larger number (and mass) of small bodies to be present in the Asteroid Belt, sufficient say for the total combined mass to equal 100% of our Moon's mass?
