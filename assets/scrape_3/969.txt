Will Neptune be visible with the naked eye if I am standing on its satellite

Assume that I am standing on one of the many satellites of Neptune. Will I be able to see the planet with my naked eyes (without any sort of visual aid).
If I was to stand on Moon I would be able to see the Earth because the light from Sun is reflected off Earth into my eyes and I am able to see Earth. In case of Neptune, the distance between Neptune and the Sun is so great that the sun would look like any other star (a bit brighter). In that case if I am looking at Neptune would I be able to see it ?
What about the other gas giants ?
