periodic inclination change circumbinary planet

I am studying circumbinary planets and I made a python model to calculate certain properties of the orbits, and when I calculate the inclination I get a sine wave. 
I do not see a way to predict the shape of the curve in advance, despite it being a rather simple curve. Furthermore, when I plot the eccentricity of the orbit the frequencies of the curves do not align.
Would anyone know why it oscillates at this rate and amplitude?
And a side question, would anyone know some literature on the subject of circumbinary planets?
