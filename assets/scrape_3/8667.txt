The destruction of the Universe by a bubble

So I was watching a documentary on television about this and a number of theories that are proposed as to what the fate of the Universe will be:

"Big Crunch"
"Big Freeze"
"Big Rip" 

I understand these, but there was also another scenario which I don't understand:

A bubble forms in the Universe and expands at the speed of light. It annihilates everything in the Universe that it comes into contact with, until eventually at a very, very distant time the Universe ceases to exist. Does anyone have any clue as to what they were talking about (because I don't)?
