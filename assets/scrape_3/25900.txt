Is there a possibility that a white dwarf can turn into a neutron star or a black hole?

I know that a white dwarf is supported mainly by electron degeneracy pressure and that if it gains more than about 1.4 solar masses from any source (such as a companion star or a collision), it explodes as a type Ia supernova. But is there any possibility that a white dwarf can turn into a neutron star (or possibly a black hole)?
