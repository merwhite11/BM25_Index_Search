Could a dwarf galaxy host a star at the center instead of a SMBH?

I don't think this would be possible, but I'm curious, and as what ever query I googled I only found posts about black holes indeed existing, what black holes are, that even the Milky Way has a black hole in its center or that We can't know if dwarf galaxies have non-SMBH at their center.
So sorry if it is a stupid question but I didn't want to go on with assuming something without knowing: So is it theoretically possible for a Galaxy to have a star at its gravitational center of mass?
