Speed of light in a black hole

If I had a directional photon-emitting source and placed it inside a black hole pointing upward and out towards the visible universe, I assume the photons traveling at the speed of light would slow and reverse direction back into the center.
So if I took the same source and placed it outside of the black hole pointing inward towards the black hole center, can I assume that an emitted photon would travel towards the center faster than the speed of light it is already traveling at?
