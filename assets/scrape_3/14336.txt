Are there any galaxies which fell out of sight horizon due to cosmic expansion?

If farthest galaxies run away from us with acceleration making them exceed speed of light, we should expect them to disappear from sky among time with increasing quantity. Did we observe this? Can we indicate next galaxies to eliminate and their time of decline?
My question concerns galaxies moving with all speed ranges, not only ones greater than speed of light.
