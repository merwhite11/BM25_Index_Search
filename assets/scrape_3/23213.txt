What happens to organic material in space

Since there is no bacteria and oxygen in space, what will happen to a dead chicken's body if released into space?  
Assuming it's far enough for any nearby planet to collide with, will it rot? Freeze forever?  
Should we release the chicken into intergalactic space, will that change anything?
