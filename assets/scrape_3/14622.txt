Tunnel vision while viewing through a reflector

I have a Celestron astromaster130 eq. While viewing through its eyepiece, or using a smartphone camera for photography purpose there is always a definitive no light region( it is circular in curvature). I make sure that I look directly at the eyepiece, but this tunneling makes it really difficult to view things at times. I have googled this, but am not sure of what this effect is called. Is it a general problem or is there a need to rectify some fault in the telescope itself. If not, what are the ways in which this can be effectively reduced?
Thanks.
