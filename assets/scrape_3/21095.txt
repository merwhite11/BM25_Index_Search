Good ways to safely view an Eclipse?

August 21 is going to see a total eclipse across most of the US, and I'm planning a trip to what I hope is an ideal viewing location.
What are good ways to safely view the eclipse?  
I don't want to make a big trip out of it, only to be looking into a poor quality pin-hole shoebox, or $2 mirrored cardboard glasses.  How can get I get a good, detailed clear view of it while staying safe?  What about ways to photograph it effectively?
