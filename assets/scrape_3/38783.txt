Point spread function image deconvolution

I would like to deconvolve an image of Saturn.

I took an image of Saturn: Stack of 50 frames, the angular resolution of the original frames is 1.6''/pixel and the frames are scaled x4 before stacking.
I took an image of a star (Altair) using the same optical system and the same camera settings, stack of 50 frames, same resolution as Saturn. The separation between the star and Saturn is about 30°. I think that the shape of the star is mostly caused by the chromatic aberration of the scope.
I deconvolved saturn using Richardson–Lucy algorithm and the normalized image of the star as the point spread function (PSF) of the system.

However, the result is absurd (cf image). Why doesn't this method work? The image of the star seems pretty big. Do I miss a step to recover the PSF ?
