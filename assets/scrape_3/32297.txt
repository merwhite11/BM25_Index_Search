If space is negative energy and matter is positive energy then does that mean the universe is finite?

I was reading a book by Stephen Hawking, it was written that universe is made up of 2 ingredients,i.e., space and energy and space was the negative energy, so they add up to 0. But since space is energy does that mean it is finite?
