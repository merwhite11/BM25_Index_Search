Calculating the range of visible Right Ascension and Declination from specific location + time

Given a specific date and time, and coordination of a location on earth, how can I calculate (myself, or using a python package) range of visible RA and Dec? 
For example (but I'm looking for a general solution and formula):
input: 

date and time: 2019-05-01 23:00:00
earth coordinates: 32.0853° N, 34.7818° E

output: 

RA min: ?
RA max: ?
Dec min: ?
Dec max: ?
