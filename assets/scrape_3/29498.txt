Can any type of stars be contact binaries?

In this article Shortest distance between stars it is mentioned that 

Some double stars can actually be in contact with each other.
This occurs when a red giant star has a white dwarf star companion in
  a very close orbit.

However, this isnt the case
Hottest, heaviest touching double stars

In the case of VFTS 352, however, both stars in the system are of
  almost identical size. Material is, therefore, not sucked from one to
  another, but instead may be shared.

My question then is, can any type of stars be contact binaries, or are there some limitations in the type of stars for contact binaries to appear?
