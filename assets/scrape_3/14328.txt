Gravitational field released during supernovae

During the collapse of a star at the commencement of supernovae, the intense pressures force fusion and fission to create the heavier elements and release vast amounts of energy. As this energy/mass is released - the gravitational field must also decrease in an instant, and as this "Warping of space time" is instantly released and returns to flat space (Or flatter space) - does this create or contribute to the explosion of the supernovae itself? I have always been puzzled by the concept of the collapsed outer layers "Bouncing off of an in-compressible core" as the source of the explosion. Isn't this instantaneous "Relaxation of the curvature of the space" not what we see as the explosion?
