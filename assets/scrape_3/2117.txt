How big is the universe. How does it works?

I watch this movie:
How big is the universe

I can't understand where is there triangle with 180 degrees.
What exactly is this red spot on the cosmic microwave background? 
Is it a base of triangle? How does it appear that this spot is smooth surface but not a concavity?
