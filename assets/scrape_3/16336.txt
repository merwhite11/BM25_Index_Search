Would a viewer see Earth from the rim of Shackleton Crater?

I've been researching this but so far have not found an answer.  If you were standing on the top of the rim of Shackleton Crater at the lunar south pole, would you be able to see any of Earth? I can't find anything about the height of the rim, although nearby Malapert Mountain is apparently visible from Earth so you could see Earth from Malapert.  Shackleton, though, I'm not so sure.  Any insights appreciated. KPRedmond
