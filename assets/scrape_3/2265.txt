Has someone looked the other way?

I learned that gravity always pulls, it is always attractive. There is no antigravity, no "negative"  mass. I also learned that most matter is dark, invisible. We know that because we see visible matter moving towards invisible bundles of dark matter and other effects like accelaration or gravity lenses. 
What I ask myself is: Couldn't there be "negative" bundles of mass just the other way that pushes matter away instead of invisible dark matter that pulls it? Has someone tried to find something like that? 
What is the proof for the fact "Gravity is always attractive" beside that fact that it seems to be? 
Granted, it may be a stupid question, but I lack a bit in physics education that is not very related to chemistry.
