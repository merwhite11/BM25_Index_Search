Group of satellite like objects moving through the sky in a formation

This evening while siting in the garden I saw an unusual group of light objects in the sky. On their own each of the 5 objects would look like a satellite and I would not give it a second thought.
The mentioned objects clearly moved in the same direction across the sky and with a speed and light pattern of a satellite. The other unusual thing was that the objects were rapidly changing formation moving away and towards one-another with no discernible pattern.
Also I would like to say as I Live in the London area I am quite accustomed to seeing planes in the night sky and do not think the object I saw was a plane or planes. The light emitted was white and constant and the formation of the objects was fairly scattered and changing very fast.
Can anyone please suggest what was it that I saw?
