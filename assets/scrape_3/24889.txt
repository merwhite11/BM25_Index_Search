How does an Echelle spectrograph put such a long, high resolution spectrum into a square-ish format?

In order to obtain a very high resolution spectrum to resolve closely spaced lines, or to measure doppler shits, spectrographs are operated with very high dispersion.
But photographic plates and CCDs usually have rectangular formats with aspect ratios not very far from square. 
Echelle spectrographs can put a highly dispersed spectrum into this format, but how? This article explains to some extent, but a concise discussion here would also be helpful.
