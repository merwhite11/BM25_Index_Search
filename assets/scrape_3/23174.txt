Energy Source for Gamma Rays from Merging Neutron Stars

When the two neutron stars merged in the latest event, large amounts of gamma rays were emitted.  Given that their deorbitting is a result of gravitational wave production, where does the energy for the gamma rays come from?
The only sources I can think of are the rotational kinetic energies of the merging stars or the potential energy released by the final collapse into a single spherical mass.
