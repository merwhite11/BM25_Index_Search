How do we measure the age of the universe?

As mentioned in wiki/Age_of_the_universe,

The current measurement of the age of the universe is around 13.8 billion years (as of 2015) – 13.799±0.021 billion years

When my friend who is not from science background asks me how do we measure the age of the universe? How should I explain to him?
