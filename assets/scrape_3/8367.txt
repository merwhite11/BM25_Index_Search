What is a possible software for simulating binary star systems?

I would like to define both initial velocities and masses of components so that orbits may be either elliptical of hyperbolic. Is there any software to make such simulation?
Unfortunately, Binary Star Combined Solution Package is out of date and NASA online plotter supports only circular orbits. 
Thanks.
