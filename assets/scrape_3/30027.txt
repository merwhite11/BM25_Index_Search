Why does gravity make time go slower and warp light?

I know that objects with lots of gravity are capable of warping light or slowing time (an example being a black hole). I also know this is because of the theory of relativity, but I need someone to expand on that and explain why/how that works. 
Also, please write the answer in somewhat simple terms, as I am not (yet) an expert on this stuff :)
