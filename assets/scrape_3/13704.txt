Gravitational wave detection time difference between LIGO Livingston and LIGO Hanford

Quote from LIGO's news release:

By looking at the time of arrival of the signals—the detector in
Livingston recorded the event 7 milliseconds before the detector in
Hanford—scientists can say that the source was located in the Southern
Hemisphere.

GPS coordinates of LIGO Livingston: 30.5630018,-90.7763949
GPS coordinates of LIGO Hanford: 46.4554032,-119.4092701
Distance: 3030.13 km
Now if the gravitational waves propagate outwards at the speed of light a difference of 7ms implies the following maximum possible detector distance:
299792458 * 0.007 / 1000 = 2099 km

Where am I wrong ?
Update:
As pointed out by james-k in the comments below, the calculated 2099 km is the minimum distance and not the maximum ... these waves seem to have caused some mental derangement ;)
