What is the current accepted theory for Neptune's immense wind speed?

According to "Neptune: The Other Blue Planet in Our Solar System" (Choi, 2010), Neptune, despite its great distance from the sun, is the windiest planet in the solar system, with winds reaching 2000km/h (1500 mph) as detected by the Voyager 2 probe in 1989.
Given that Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun, what are the currently accepted theories for where the planet gets energy for these immense wind speeds?
