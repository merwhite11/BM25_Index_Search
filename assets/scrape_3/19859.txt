Is Dark Matter moving?

It sounds like dark matter makes up one quarter of the universe's mass-energy.  And it's density is fairly uniform.  But could it be simultaneously both uniform and moving - like currents in a lake.  Does it have a standing wave?  A propagating wave?  A rotation around some universal central point?  Local rotations around massive objects like low pressure systems on a weather map?
