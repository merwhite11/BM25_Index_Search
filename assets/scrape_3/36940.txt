Charged black holes selective eaters

We have a charged black hole which is negatively charged. For this simple case the black hole is not rotating.
If a negatively charged particle approaches the singularity the electromagnetic repulsion will become stronger than the gravitational attraction causing the object to leave the black hole? But how is that even possible .
There is only one spacetime path available for every object beyond the event horizon and what would this object experience?
Could it travel into the future and into the past after oscillating inside the black hole?
