Motion of rogue planets

Two Questions:
1) Are rogue planets in motion, i.e. are they just wandering freely in space or stationary?
1) Do rogue planets have defined path or a one which can be anticipated? I understand that there cannot be at absolute rest as they are moving along with the galaxy.
2) Do rogue planets rotate around their axes?
If they are in motion, and they outnumber the stars in our galaxy, why our solar system never had a guest?
