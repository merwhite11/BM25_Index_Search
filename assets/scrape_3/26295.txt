What is difference between horizon and comoving distances?

I wonder if there a difference between horizon and comoving distances in cosmology ?
I mean both correspond to a null geodesic $(ds^2=0)$ right ?
$$d_{horizon} (t) =a(t) \int\limits_{0}^{r} \frac{{\rm d}r'}{\sqrt{1-kr'^2}}= a(t) \int\limits_{0}^{t}\frac{ c \, {\rm d}t'}{a(t')}$$
with $a(t)$ the scale factor.
Is the difference just that for a comoving distance the integration bounderies changes ? like $r_e$,  $r_0$  and $t_0$, $t_e$ 
Thanks in advance for help
