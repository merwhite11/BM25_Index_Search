What apparent sizes of the sun an Earth like planet can have?

What is the smallest and largest sun an Earth like planet could have in its sky? What kinds of stars are those?
I saw this video and thought, yeah, some of those stars are really big in absolute terms, but Earth would have to be orbiting them proportionally further to keep the climate, making them smaller in the sky, so the video is not accurate.
