Can two heavy objects circling around their C.M. be separated because of the speed of gravity?


Imagine two massive objects, with the same mass (M) circling around their center of mass (C.M.). Let's assume that the distance between them is 1 light hour. DonÂ´t the two bodies get accelerated and move away from each other because they feel the gravity of each other as it was 1 hour ago, because of which a force tangent to the direction of the speed develops?
Can it be that gravity acts instantaneously? I've read about experiments proving the speed of gravity to be equal to the speed of light, but these were disputed.
Isn't there both in Newtonian mechanics and GR there a time delay? The difference being though that space and time in Newtonian mechanics are separate and absolute (implying instantaneity?), while in GR the both are a whole and absolute.
