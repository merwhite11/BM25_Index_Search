Can we detect exoplanets with perpendicular plane of ecliptic?

If I understand correctly, all the current exoplanet search is based on planets transitioning the distant star.
If the plane of ecliptic of that star happens to be perpendicular to line of sight from Earth to that star - or sufficiently inclined, so that orbits of all its planets as seen from Earth "circle" the star without ever transitioning it - does that mean we're completely unable to detect them?
