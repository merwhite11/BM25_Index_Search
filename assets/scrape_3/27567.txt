Looking at ourselves with a powerful telescope?

Could a small curved mirror and/or lens in Earth's orbit be aimed at a different hemisphere from where you are be be viewed with a powerful telescope to see the ground through the mirror? Would a more powerful telescope than the Hubble see more or less because of the atmosphere diffracting light twice?
Bonus: Would sending a mirror to space cost less this way then a huge camera/telescope?
