What would be the outcome for life in our galaxy if the merger of the Milky Way and Andromeda creates a Quasar?

If predictions are correct, the Milky Way and Andromeda are set to collide in around 4 billion years. If, when this occurs, a Quasar is formed by matter being accreted to the common galactic center (perhaps with the two supermassive black holes forming a binary), what would be the outcome for life in the new galaxy?
It's known that galactic collisions were much more common in the early universe; most Quasars are observed at high redshifts. It isn't clear if there are other conditions necessary to produce a quasar other than just the galactic collision itself, so obviously this is just speculation, but it is clear that Quasars are some of the most energetic systems in the Universe; if one were ignited so close to home, would every trace of life in the galaxy go out in a blaze of glory?
