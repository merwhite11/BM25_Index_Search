What can Jupiter's spectrograph tell us other than its rotational velocity?

I have data of a Jupiter's image and the spectra of each pixel in the image, and I am playing around to see what I can do with it.
I have managed to find Jupiter's rotational velocity by finding the difference between the wavelengths of H-$\alpha$ line of two pixels one at the centre and another at the edge of Jupiter's data cube.
I have also managed to identify a few spectral emission lines of Jupiter's red spot.
Is it possible to do something similar and find the orbital velocity, or the distance between Earth and Jupiter?  Or is there anything else that a spectrum of Jupiter can tell us?
