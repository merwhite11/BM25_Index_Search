Can the range of the observable universe be extended through an intermediary?

I understand that the so called observable universe has a limit we cannot see through. 
My question is whether we might get information through an intermediate hypothetical actor located halfway to the limit. This actor would have, I assume, a limit of the observable universe further away than ours. 
We, in turn, might interact with this actor in order to get information about a nova we cannot see from the Earth. 
Information about such a star might perhaps have reached the Earth earlier at a time before it changed into a nova. The information about the nova would therefore be new.
