Can one approximate the semi-major axis of an orbit as the average orbital distance for eccentric orbits?

Kepler's 3rd Law (regarding the relation between orbital period and the semi-major axis of an orbit) applies to all elliptical orbits. But as I understand it, the only reason it is safe to use the approximation that the semi-major axis of an orbit is approximately equal to the average orbital distance is because the planets of our solar system are generally not very eccentric. 

As an example, the Earth is about 1 AU away from the Sun and has a very low orbital eccentricity, so one can say that the semi-major axis of the Earth's orbit is also approximately 1 AU in length. Since P^2 (yr) = a^3 (AU), one can deduce that the orbit of Earth should take about a year. But, what if the Earth had a higher eccentricity - If the orbital eccentricity of the Earth were higher, would it still be wise to approximate the orbital distance as the semi-major axis of an orbit?
