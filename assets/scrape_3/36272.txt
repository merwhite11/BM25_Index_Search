Is it be correct to say that we live in a young (only 14 billion years old) universe?

From what I have read, it seems that our universe is expected to function more or less as it does now for some $10^{12}$ years, possibly more. If that is correct, our universe's current age of $14$ billion years seems like this place we live in is still a baby, or at most a child.
I realize we are a long way from being sure about making such a broad characterization. Nevertheless, does it generally accord with current astronomical and cosmological thinking to say that our universe is still young?
