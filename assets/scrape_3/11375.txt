Why do some artificial satellites decrease and increase in brightness multiple times?

I just observed a satellite almost directly above me travel for a few minutes while constantly dimming and then getting brighter. It did this for about 3 minutes until it faded out. I also observed a satellite with similar behavior on July 4th. I was thinking the satellite might be rotating, but I do not know of any satellites that rotate. Then I thought it could be a piece of space junk, but I don't think they get big enough to be visible from the ground. Does anyone know why the brightness of some satellites change while others remain constant? I am in the Northwest of the US. (Northern hemisphere)
