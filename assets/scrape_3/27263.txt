How bright is Comet PANSTARRS C/2017 S3 now?

The LiveScience article Incredible Hulk? Nah, This Glowing, Green Light in the Night Sky Is a Comet published just hours ago discusses Comet PANSTARRS C/2017 S3 and mentions:

bright bursts exploding from its surface twice in close succession — first on June 30, and then again about two weeks later, Sky and Telescope reported. As Hulk himself might say, "Comet flash!"

The linked Sky and Telescope article PanSTARRS Comet, Rocked by Outburst, Goes Green is dated July 17, 2018 and offers the tantallizing information that 

Comet PanSTARRS (C/2017 S3) has erupted again! Now bright enough to see in binoculars, it might become a naked-eye object if it survives until perihelion.

Question: How bright is the comet now, and how is it predicted to behave in the next week or two (baring further outbursts)?

update: The Universe Today's article Catch Comet C/2017 S3 PANSTARRS In Outburst links to S Seiichi Yoshida's page for the comet, but there's no recent data!
