When was the concept of rogue planets first theorized?

So after watching the Kurzgesagt video about life on rogue planets I became fascinated by the concept. I did some digging, and the earliest reference to the concept I could find was Philip Wylie's When Worlds Collide: a Sci Fi novel written in 1933. In the novel Wylie writes 

A sort of body that they knew existed by the millions, probably, all through the universe-something they were sure must be, but the general existence of which has never been actually proved.

The best I could come up is with after LePlace's nebular formation hypothesis became more widespread in the 19th century people just assumed rogue planets would exist. I certainly can't find anything written about them before Wylie's novel. It doesn't help that the first use of the term 'rogue planet' I could find was George R. R. Martin's novel Dying of the Light and any earlier mentions than that use several different terms to illustrate the concept.
tl;dr Who first theorized the concept of rogue planets and when did they do so?
