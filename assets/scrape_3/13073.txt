Fusion of elements inside heavy stars

I am confused with nucleosynthesis inside supernovae. I have read that the heavier elements are made through fusion of lighter element's namely hydrogen and helium. 
Does the star "store" all the elements they fuse inside themselves or are they radiated out?
Example, A star fused hydrogen into helium and 2 helium atoms into carbon. Would it keep fusing until it hits the limit and store it inside only to be released as an explosion.
