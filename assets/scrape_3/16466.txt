Do other planets with a magnetic field also have two Van Allen belts?

On Jupiter and Saturn, aurora is seen around the planet's poles, so that implies that there must be a kind of magnetic field around those planets. Perhaps even the moon Europa could have a magnetic field created by salty water (Does it?).
On Earth we have two radiation belts, an inner and outer belt. One contains electrons and the other mostly protons. Do other planets also have these two radiation belts?
