Sky in the very far future / past

Motivated by this question about a stranded submarine in the Jurassic I would like to know:
Is there anything remotely left of our current skyline if we go back or forward millions of years so that the stars rotating around the milky way covered a measurable distance ? I would expect that the proper motion of a star causes an irreversible drift out of the original position. Are there any stabilizing factors which may allow that some star configurations are still discernible ?
