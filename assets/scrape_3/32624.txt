Are there any double stars that I can actually see orbit each other?

If I had a nice amateur telescope†, are there any multiple star systems that I could observe over a few years or a few decades and actually see the movement of one or both of them over time?
My short human lifespan and limited telescope put heavy constraints on the orbital distance, brightness, and distance from the Sun, so I am guessing that if there are any at all, the number is probably small.
†arbitrarily defined as say 8-inch (20 cm) aperture, with a good set of eyepieces, and a sketch pad.
