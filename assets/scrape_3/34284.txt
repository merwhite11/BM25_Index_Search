What's the point with Hawking Radiation?

I saw that Black Holes can evaporate because of Hawking radiation.
Because pair of particle, antiparticle can spawn at any point of the space, the antiparticle could be absorbed by the black hole and the particle go outside of it, like if the black hole where "lightning".
But, if one element of the pair can be absorbed by the black hole, isn't there an equal probability of that the particle will be absorbed, too?
I could imaginate that the probability of fluctuation of going into 0 with an equal probability of +1 or -1 mass over time is nonnull, also that's why black hole could evaporate, or something like it?
