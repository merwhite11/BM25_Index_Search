What's the temperature of Pluto's core?

The surface is freezing-nitrogen cold, but it's typical for the temperature to increase towards the core. What's the temperature of the core of Pluto? Is the planet icy and rocky all the way through? I wonder at the possibility if that frozen ice ball could have any internal heat at all?
