Questions about Hubble's brand new view of an interstellar comet (video)


This GIF is made (via giphy.com) from the new NASA Goddard video Hubble's New Image of Interstellar Object and if I understand correctly many (if not all) of these frames are from https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=16009 (from this answer).
I have some questions about this set of images. I've plotted the start times below.

There are four groups that last about 45 minutes, each followed by a break of either 45 minutes or 90+45 minutes, is this related to the HST's orbit? 
I notice a slow rotation of the star tracks over the duration of the roughly seven hours of data, it looks like roughly 20 degrees, (see GIF or the individual images) and I can't figure that out at all. Is it a rotation of the HST around its own axis?
Individual preview images (example) appear to be rhomboidal rather than square, why?
