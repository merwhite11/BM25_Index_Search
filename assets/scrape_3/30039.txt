If FTL travel is possible, can I look back in time to a younger earth?

For this question assume that.
We found a way to go faster than light.
I build a ship that could go faster than light and go to another planet with this ship in the span of mere hours. The ship was built in a year time.
If I travel to another planet one light year from Earth, and I would look back.
Would I see the ship being built?
Since the light that comes from earth is 1 year old when it reaches me you would assume that I can see the ship being built 1 year back(with a powerful telescope)
So my question is : If FTL travel is possible, can I look back in time to a younger earth?
