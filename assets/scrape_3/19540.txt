Do interstellar rocks pose a threat to interstellar travel?

In the recently released movie Passengers the ship hits a chunk of rock about the size of a softball that punches through multiple layers of hull and creates a problem.
Assuming that a spaceship is traveling away from Earth at near light speed through interstellar space for a distance of 2 to 10 light years is there a significant probability that it would hit a rock that could do serious damage?
