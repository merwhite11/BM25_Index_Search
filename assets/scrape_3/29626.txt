What's the proportion of Mars' surface compared to Earth's surface uncovered of water?

How does Mars surface compare to Earth's surface? Mars is quite smaller than Earth, but most Earth's surface is covered with water. I thought making the math could be relatively easy but Earth isnt a sphere and I dont know about Mars?
