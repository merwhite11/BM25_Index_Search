Does the given radius of a planet/moon include its atmosphere?

In NASA fact sheets, such as this one for Venus, a radius of the planet is given.
Is that radius the radius of the surface of the planet, or of the envelope of atmosphere?
Put another way, if calculating the angular diameter of a planet/moon from a location, do I only have to look up this radius, or do I have to look up this radius along with the atmosphere height to determine the angular diameter?
