Would a low albedo substance warm up Mars?

If Mars were coated in a dark substance that absorbs sunlight (including infrared light), would this heat up Mars?  I am envisioning a fine dust that is dispersed into the atmosphere, but possibly settles on Mars's surface all around.  If we were able to change the albedo, possibly down to as low as 1%, would that make Mars habitable (temperature wise)?  If the albedo were changed all the way to 1%, could this even make Mars too hot?
