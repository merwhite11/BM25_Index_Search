How does one interpret the definition of "accretion" in galaxy formation?

I am having trouble finding a solidifying definition of accretion when it comes to galaxy formation models and galaxy evolutions. Where as, in the context of satellite galaxies, dwarf galaxies, or gasses.
For example, how do interpret the sentence "Even
dwarf and Milky Way-sized halos do accrete new mass at low
redshifts".
Does this mean that they "gain" new mass or does this mean they "leak" new mass?
