Moon looks too small in 3D model

I'm not sure if this is more a question for a 3D graphics forum, but I'm trying here first in case the answer has more to do with astronomy than 3D.
I am creating a model of the Earth and Moon in a piece of 3D software. To avoid the enormous scale of using real-world sizes, I am using a 1000:1 scale ratio.
These are the dimensions I'm using:

Earth radius = 6,371 m
Moon radius = 1,737 m
Distance from Earth to
Moon = 384,400 m

Since I have scaled everything equally, I would assume that the proportions of things would look accurate, but the moon looks very small indeed.
Here is a quick render from a camera placed just above the surface of the Earth, looking out at the moon:

The camera's focal length is 24mm, which I understand to be relatively similar to the human eye. I was expecting the moon to look similar in size to how it looks when you look up at it in real life but, as you can see, it's a tiny little dot.
Is there something obvious I'm missing here, or some explanation for this discrepancy?
