What is the Terra phase?

Does the Moon have a night and day like Earth? When sitting on the Moon and viewing the Earth what does it look like when the Earth goes through phases like the Lunar Phase? How does the sun travel through the Moon's sky facing the Earth like this gif?
Part of my question was a duplicate so I deleted it and posted the other link below.
How bright is the full Earth during the lunar midnight?
