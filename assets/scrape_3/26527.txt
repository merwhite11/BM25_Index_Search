Question on Friedman equation involving cosmological constant

This is the question:
By considering both the Friedmann and acceleration equations, and assuming a pressureless
Universe, demonstrate that in order to have a static Universe we must have
a closed Universe with a positive vacuum energy. Using either physical arguments
or mathematics, demonstrate that this solution must be unstable.
I started off with the friedmann equation and equated H^2=0 and K>0. How to proceed further and prove that lamda is positive?
