If a star were travelling at 99% of the speed of light, directly at Earth would we see it?

Stars being flung from black holes in the news made me question if something were heading directly for us at the speed of light, would we even know?
Update: Since it's impossible for a star to travel at the speed of light, would we see it coming if it were traveling at 99% the speed of light? and if so, how much warning would we have?
