Why doesn't the earth's surface collapse onto itself?

From what I know the sun (or any other star) nuclear fission keeps it from collapsing under its own gravity until the fuel runs out, if that's so why doesn't the earth surface like the tectonic plates collapse to the earth's core? is it because of similar processes that happen in the earth's outer core (nuclear fission)? and if so what would happen if they would once stop?
