Meteor shower predicted to be best viewed BEFORE midnight (for reasons other than the moon)?

Reading that the Leonids meteor shower is almost upon us, I clicked some links (e.g. EarthSky.org and NatGeo) to read more of the prediction; especially the part about when to best view them.
I had a Déjà vu when I saw "early morning hours" because it seemed to me that "that's what they always say". 
I'm guessing that it's not a coincidence that the constellation for which the shower is named always seems to rise around or after midnight at the time of year when the shower occurs.
So I'd like to ask if this is true, that they pretty much always are best viewed after midnight (except when issues of weather or the Moon interfere), and if there has ever been a shower where this wasn't the case — one that was best viewed before midnight.
