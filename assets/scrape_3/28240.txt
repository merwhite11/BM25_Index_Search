What is it exactly about these flares of infrared light from Sgr A* that "confirms" it is a supermassive black hole?

Scientists confirm a 'supermassive black hole' at the heart of our galaxy
It's "mind-boggling", they say.

FYI, the GRAVITY instrument measures infrared light, not gravity. 
What is it exactly about these flares of infrared light from Sgr A* that confirms it is a supermassive black hole?
Certainly there is plenty of evidence, the orbits of stars nearby for one. But this use of the word confirm seems strong and frequent enough to suggest the deal has been done, the ink is dry, and it's a black hole without question and that until now that wasn't so.

I've shamelessly absconded the following images from this answer to the question What is the evidence for a supermassive black hole at the center of Milky Way?, which may need a new answer!
Note, the size of these stellar orbits are compared to those of Sedna, Eris, Pluto and Neptune in the bottom right corner (same scale)!
