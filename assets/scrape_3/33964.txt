How to determine the orbital period of an asteroid using Kepler laws given its orbit's radius?

Given that the mean distance of an asteroid from the Sun is $450 \times 10^6$ km is it possible that the asteroid completes one rotation around the Sun in two years?

According to the third law of Kepler the farther a planet if from the Sun the longer is its orbital period. Because the distance from the Sun to earth is $149 \times 10^6$ km and it takes a year for earth to complete the rotation then for the asteroid it would take 3 years.
I tried to actually calculate how much time would take for the asteroid to complete one rotation combining Newton's law of gravitation and Kepler's third law and given $G=6.673 \times 10^{-11} Nm^2/kg^2$ and converting all distances to meters:
$$
T^2=\frac{4\pi^2r^3}{G\cdot M_{Sun}}=\frac{4\pi^2\cdot 450^3\cdot 10^{21}}{6.673\cdot 10^{-11}\cdot 1.989\cdot 10^{30}}=\frac{4\pi^2\cdot 450^3\cdot 10^2}{6.673\cdot 1.989}=2.99\cdot 450^3\cdot 10^2=27246375\cdot 10^3.
$$
Then $T=\sqrt{27246375\cdot 10^3}=165064$ seconds $=45$ hours. Is there something wrong in my calculations or I'm not using the correct formula?
