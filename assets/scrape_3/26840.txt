The Solar Motion and the peculiar velocities of stars

Local standard Of Rest is the hypothetical origin of a reference system with respect to which the motions of all stars in some neighborhood of the sun average out to be zero
which type of motions of stars average out to be zero and how can I justify that their average will be zero?
What is Peculiar Motion? How does it look like?
How we measure the proper motions of stars as seen from the sun as we can only observe from earth?
