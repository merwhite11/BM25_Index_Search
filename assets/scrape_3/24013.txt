Are stars beyond the asteroid belt less constant?

If we graph the variability of a small bright star which is lined up with the asteroid belt, is it less constant than stars that are far away from the asteroid belt? To what degree does variability change relative to distance away from the most dense areas of the solar system?
I added the arrows to illustrate the question.
