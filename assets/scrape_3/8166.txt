How to convert a gravitational force to speed and direction

I am doing some calculations, and I wanted to know that after using the gravity equation, $$F = G \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$ if you can use $F$ and convert it into a speed, such as km/year, and also a direction or angle from the original direction. I am just looking into astronomy, and any help is appreciated.
