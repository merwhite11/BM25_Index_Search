Discovery in Astronomy vs one in Physics - do they differ in required burden of evidence?

Discovery in Astronomy/Astrophysics (of astronomical objects) vs discovery of physical phenomena in experimental Physics (as such) - do they differ in required burden of evidence (with the notion, that astronomy/astrophysics deals with real physically existing astronomical objects, while the aim of experimental physics per se is mostly to verify rather somewhat abstract concepts of theoretical physics)?
Perhaps answering my question in some definite way would require some analysis with historical perspective and consideration of precedences ...
This generalized question of mine was motivated by more specific case featured in https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/236107/25575
