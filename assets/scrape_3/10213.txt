Naming of the planets of the solar system

Planets of the solar system have been named with Roman mythology gods names. I have a few questions on my mind concerning that subject for a while:

Who decided to name them like this?
When did the planets got named?

Finally, the ultimate question is: if the planets got named by the Romans, implying they had not technology to observe the solar system whatsoever, why some of the names match the color of the planets? 

Mars is red - Mars is the god of war
Neptune is blue - Neptune is the god of the oceans

Or maybe I am wrong (most likely) and the planets have been named more recently.
