Various moon orbits

Orbits can follow certain patterns, as I am aware.  Some include a circular orbit around the bulk of the planet, a polar orbit spinning about the pole...
What I'd like to know, for a planet with two moons (one large one in a circular orbit at the equator, more or less), could the smaller moon, at a larger range but higher velocity, be pulled into an orbit that looks like a polar orbit for part of it's cycle, then transition towards a circular one before "flipping" back towards a polar orbit on the opposing pole, dancing between the three states either in sequence or seemingly at random as the smaller moon approaches certain criteria, being tugged on by the planet, the larger moon, the sun, maybe other planets in the system.
Is this feasible, or does it break the laws of orbital dynamics to have such a situation occur?  This is for a story I am writing centered on a planet other than Earth, but is relatively Earth-like in it's properties.
Size and density the same as Earth.  Orbit a bit tighter and faster than Earth's in relation to it's sun.  The smaller moon is perhaps 200 square miles in surface area, tidally locked stone and ice.  The larger is perhaps 42 million square miles in surface area.
Any thoughts on this?  The basic idea is that this smaller moon, Eamor, is going to be seen in the night's sky almost like a star to the naked eye, racing across the skies as if scared of it's own shadow, sometimes disappearing under the horizon only to dart back up again.  Hence the name, which means, in the language of one culture on the planet, "one who is terrified".
