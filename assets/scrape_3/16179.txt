Does the summit of a small mountain offer better seeing?

I have a small amateur telescope, and would like to defeat the atmospheric seeing conditions as much as is possible.
Fortuitously, I happen to live fairly close to this lovely patch of bare elevated rock:
It's a granite peak about 3,155ft (960m) above sea level.
Would this peak be expected to have improved seeing, as compared to the seeing from an adjacent valley on the same night?
