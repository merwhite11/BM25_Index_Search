Could asteroid 'Oumuamua actually be round?

News articles have mentioned that the recently discovered asteroid 'Oumuamua is theorized to be greatly elongated based on observations of brightness variation. However, this hypothesis seems to be based on the assumption that the object's albedo distribution is reasonably uniform.
What if it isn't? Could large periodic brightness variations also be explained by 'Oomuamua having two highly contrasting hemispheres like Iapetus? If the astronomers involved have already eliminated this competing explanation, how would they have done so and with what additional observational data?
