Do Enceladus' geysers fall back to its surface or do they achieve escape velocity?

Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has a very low surface gravity at 0.114 m/sÂ² or 0.012 g. It has a subsurface ocean of liquid water and is ejecting plumes of it. Does the ejected water eventually fall/rain down to the surface or does it (or some of it) achieve escape velocity due to Enceladus' very low mass and gravity? If so, is Enceladus losing mass and will eventually run out of water?
