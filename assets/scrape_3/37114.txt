What effects does the motion of the Sun have on the perihelion precession of Mercury?

According to the wikipedia page, there are multiple effects contributing to the perihelion precession of Mercury.
Of course, according to this link and this link we know that the Sun is itself orbiting around a barycenter that sometimes crosses its own surface. Are there any calculations that tell us what effects this has on the perihelion precession of mercury?
Edit: I see now that you can do calculations in a barycentric reference frame or in a heliocentric reference frame. If one chooses to use the heliocentric frame (which is an accelerating frame), one would have to take into account "third body effects" on Mercury.
My question now comes down to the following: do we know whether or not these third body effects were taken into account in the calculation for the 532 arcsec/century value listed in the wiki link?
