How to analyse Jovian signal received at 20.1 MHz using dual dipole antenna?

I have purchased a Radio Jove kit and set it up. I have also received some signals. I am using Radio Skypipe II software as discussed in this Radio Jove tutorial (see also here) with a sound card to record and analyze the output of the receiver.
But what I get is like an image on the screen, which can be zoomed, and I'm not sure what I'm looking at.
What further process should I follow to make some analysis of Jovian radio signals at 20.1 MHz beyond just looking at the image (spectrogram? waterfall plot?) that the software produces?
Here is an example of the Radio Skypipe II output from their link:
