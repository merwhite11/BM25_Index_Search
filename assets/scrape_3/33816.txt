Can a dying, swelling, star be rejuvinated by enveloping orbiting gas giants?

Many hot jupiter type exoplanets have been found, orbiting near their parent stars.
At the end of a stars life, they swell up and sometimes envelop closely orbiting bodies.
Combine these effects and what could/would happen? Could the unfused hydrogen of a gas giant be dragged into the stars core and end up rejuvinating the star and extend its lifetime? Have these conditions been contemplated before? What might be expected to happen? Or is the environment of a stars outer layers just not dense enough to keep a gas giant from just continuing in its orbit?
