Percentage of charted stars

I was reading Gene Roddenberry's guide for TNG writers and he mentions that that the time of ST:TOS, only 4% of the stars in our galaxy have been charted; this goes up to 19% by the time of TNG. This got me to wondering: what percentage of stars in the Milky Way galaxy have actually been catalogued?
