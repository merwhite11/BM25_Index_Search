How do I remove fungus from a telescope mirror?

I use a Celestron NexStar 130SLT Azimuthal Newtonian Reflector. I noticed that recently, due to the wet season, some tiny spots of what appears to be fungus have appeared. 
Having taking appropriate precautions to prevent the same in future, how can I presently get rid of these fungi colonies on my primary reflector?
