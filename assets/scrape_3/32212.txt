Sorting out Julian Day, Julian Date, Julian Day number, Julian Day Calendar, and Julian Day Table

In this answer I mention day number which is 1 on the first day of each calendar year (January 1) and increments to 365 or 366 on December 31 of that year.
There was an edit proposed, which included a sentence explaining that this could be called the Julian Day. I left a message (elsewhere) to the author of the edit I rejected saying:

Hi, I rejected your edit on this answer because Julian day is not correct. JD is monotonic and is currently 2,458,643.06

to which the author replied

@uhoh many thanks for the comment! However, there is such a thing as Julian Day of the year. See this NASA web page: https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/browse/calendar.html

Looking further I saw several similar pages: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Some are called Julian Day Calendar and the rest are called Julian Day Table, but each is a table of what I have defined as day numbers, 1 on January 1, and 365 or 366 on December 31.
Could someone help me sort out all of the possible, acceptable terms for the following numbers corresponding to yesterday which include some form of Julian:
