Why is it impossible to estimate the inclination of an exoplanet with the Radial Velocity Method?

The formula of the radial velocity is:
$$v_i= V - K(\sin(f_i+\omega)\ + e\sin\omega),$$ with
$$K = \frac{m_p}{m_s+m_p}\frac{na\sin i}{\sqrt{1-e^2}}.$$
Being $V$the systematic velocity of the system,
$m_p$ the mass of the planet, $m_s$ the mass of the star, $n = \frac{2\pi}{P}$ the mean motion and $P$ is orbital period of planet, $a$ the length of the semi-major axis of the planet, $i$ the inclination of the orbital plane with the ecliptic,
$e$ the eccentricity of the planet, $f_i$ the true anomaly at time $t_i$ and $\omega$ the longitude of periastron.
It's well known the usual procedure. You have data about the instances $t_i$, the radial velocities $v_i$ at time $t_i$ and then you also have the measurements uncertainties $\sigma_i$. With that data, you can estimate 6 parameters: $V$, $K$, $e$, $\omega$, $T$ (the periastron passage time) and $P$. After you estimate these parameters, you can calculate (if you know the mass of the star and you assume that $m_p<<m_s$), $m_p\sin i$, which is known as the minimum mass. So, as far as this way shows, you got no way to estimate the mass of the planet and the inclination separately. 
But what if instead of estimate this set of parameters, we introduce another one? Just one with all the parameters in the equation: $V$, $m_p$, $i$, $e$, $T$, $\omega$, etc.? Couldn't that be possible? But nonetheless, it's always assumed that it's impossible to know the inclination with the RV data. Is there some reason why?
