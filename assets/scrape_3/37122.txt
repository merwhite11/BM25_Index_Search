Why are Delta Aquariids "for the southern hemisphere" while the Perseids are "for the north"?

In the video How to spot Comet NEOWISE, plus the largest 3D map of the Universe | Night Sky News July 20 after 05:28 Dr. Becky (Smethurst, Oxford astrophysicist) says:

…and it just so happens that we’ll be passing through the debris trail of two of the comets whilst comet NEOWISE is going to be visible in the sky, and so that’s going to cause to very popular meteor showers. There’s the Delta Aquariids meteor shower at the end of July, and then the Perseids meteor shower mid-August time.
And the Perseids meteor shower is just hands down the BEST meteor shower of the year. There’s something like sixty meteors per hour during its peak which this year is going to be the 12th of August.
Now the Delta Aquariidss are probably more like fifteen to twenty meteors per hour, so not quite as spectacular as the Perseids, but the Delta Aquariids really are more for the southern hemisphere where the Perseids is really going to be for the Northern hemisphere.

Question: Why are Delta Aquariids for the southern hemisphere while the Perseids are for the north? The Earth is moving along its orbit at 29 km/sec in both cases, why the big difference?
