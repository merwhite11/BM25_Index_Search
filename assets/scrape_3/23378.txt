Is this photocomposition of Andromeda's galaxy and the Moon accurate?

I recently saw the below image circulating around twitter/Facebook/reddit. It is titled "Andromeda's actual size if it was brighter":

One of the comments provides a link to another comparison provided by APOD, and the following comment mentions that the first one I linked seems a bit off.
Is the first image accurate in term of relative sizes? What is the relative angular size of Andromeda's galaxy and the Moon?
