How to name planets outside our galaxy?

Recently, planets outside our galaxy have been discovered.
How would be the convention to naming these planets? As far as I know, it seems that there is no standard for naming exoplanets even in our galaxy.
But if I'm publishing a scientific paper and I wish to name some of these recently discovered planets, what would be some guildelines on doing so?
