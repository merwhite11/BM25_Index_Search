Are there any known objects in a "dual" tidally locked orbit?

Is there any known pair of objects tidally locked with each other?  I know the moon is tidally locked with the earth (e.g. one side always facing earth), but I don't know of any pair of objects that are both tidally locked with each other.  For example, the planet would be tidally locked with the moon, and the moon would be tidally locked with the planet.
