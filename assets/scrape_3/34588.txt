stars moving in the sky or something

I was out in the garden having a cigarette and was watching the shy looking at three stars for about 5 minutes. suddenly they moved in the sky and crossed paths.one has now stopped still and would just look like a star the other moved right across the sky and has now stopped also. if you were looking at them now u would think they were just a normal star in the sky.
what are they really? 
Has someone else seen this before I have seen this about 5 times in the last ten years
