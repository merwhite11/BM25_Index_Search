Darkness in Outer Space

I am trying to imagine how dark outer space is. Looking at images of cosmonauts in space proved not very useful, as the exposure makes space look completely dark.
Thinking about it, I would imagine an object would be quite well illuminated, being bombarded by provided it's not in the shadow of a planet or some other celestial body. Is that correct? How about light scattering? Is cosmic dust abundant enough for the purpose?
EDIT: @zephyr made me realize that the quantity of light is a function of position, so let's say the question is with regards to the Milky Way. Still, I would appreciate some comments on what's the situation outside the Milky Way too.
