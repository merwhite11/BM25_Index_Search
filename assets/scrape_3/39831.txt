Graph of apparent magnitude of Mars through time from around 2000 to present?

I tried to search online but failed to find a graph of the apparent magnitude of Mars over time from 2000 to present.
From Wikipedia:

Mars made its closest approach to Earth and maximum apparent
brightness in nearly 60,000 years, 55,758,006 km (0.37271925 AU;
34,646,419 mi), magnitude âˆ’2.88, on 27 August 2003. ...
Every 15 to 17 years, Mars comes into opposition near its perihelion. These perihelic oppositions make a closer approach to
earth than other oppositions which occur every 2.1 years. Mars comes
into perihelic opposition in 2003, 2018 and 2035, with 2020 and 2033
being close to perihelic opposition.

So I am very curious how the present 2020 perihelic opposition apparent magnitude of Mars compare to the previous ones. It would be even more interesting if the graph also contains the distance to earth.
Could anyone point me to where I can find such a graph? Thanks.
