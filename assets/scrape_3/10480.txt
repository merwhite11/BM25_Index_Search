How to differentiate between images of a gravitationally lensed object

The light coming from a distant galaxy or star can be distorted en route to Earth; this distortion is caused by the curvature of space when a massive object is present. My question is, how can we tell whether these doppelgangers are from the same galaxy (especially in the case of a star)?
