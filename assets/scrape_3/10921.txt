Is our universe included inside a black hole?

This question repetitively comes to my mind but I've never found any good scientist article to argue about it, only esoteric or speculative web articles without much valuable background.
So let's suppose we're in the middle of a "black hole" ...
To me, here is why this would make sense:

Big bang
The word big bang itself may be inapproriate, indeed it is said to be an "explosion" but an "explosion" without any center.  
With the idea of being inside a black-hole, it is easier to represent this as being the matter entering the black-hole. From our position, and as we are attracted by the singularity, everything seems to expand wherever we look at. And as far as we can look at, we can only see the cosmic background radiation.
Dark matter
On the contrary of matter entering the black-hole, dark matter is the matter already in front of us and we'll never be able to access it as its light (i.e. information) cannot go backward within the singularity.
Time/Gravitation
Time is a dimension like any other and as we feel x,y,z dimensions as a field of view, we fell time as an irrepressible attraction toward the singularity. Gravity may be see also as a less irrepressible dimension (depending on mass around).
Other black holes
Other black-hole we "see" may let us envision the shape of the universe not as simple torus, but higher dimensional "toric" shape with "connections" everywhere (maybe shapes like high order atomic orbitals ?).

Is there any reasonable scientific background to argue/contradict about this ?
