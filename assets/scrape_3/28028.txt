Is the passage of three asteroids near Earth today just coincidental?

I just saw in the advertisement-laden tabloid Express that three near-Earth astroids will pass the Earth today:


The first of the three, dubbed Asteroid 2018 TU4, will come as close as 0.03637 astronomical units (au) or 14.16 lunar distances. around 3.13pm BST (2.13pm2 UTC)
The next asteroid to pass the Earth is Asteroid SL3 at around 3.36pm BST (2.36pm BST).
Lastly, Asteroid 2018 TS1 will come closest to Earth at around 3.45pm BST (2.45pm UTC) today.


Question: Is this just coincidental, or is there some relationship between these three particular asteroids, perhaps in the past, that would make their near-coincident arrival more likely?
