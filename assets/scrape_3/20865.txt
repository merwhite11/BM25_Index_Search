What exactly is it that is being magnified 50 times in this gravitational lensing observation?

In the Los Angeles Times news item Scientists get a rare view of a type Ia supernova magnified 50 times what exactly is magnified 50 times? 
This supernova is really very far away. Is it somehow imaged by the gravitational lensing and being resolved — the actual supernova itself?
edit: I believe this is it, but it's behind a paywall (will confirm in due course): http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6335/291

An analysis of the distortion has revealed that some of the distant star-forming galaxies are as bright as 40 trillion Suns, and have been magnified by the gravitational lens by up to 22 times.
