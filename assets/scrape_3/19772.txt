Is "Giga-hertz Astrophysical Transient Emission" distinct in any way from "Fast Radio Burst"?

In this answer I have just read about The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley's The Spacecraft Tracking and Astronomical Research into Giga-hertz Astrophysical Transient Emission (STARGATE).
While Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) seem to fit that description spot-on, I am wondering if the phrase was chosen to be in some way broader or more general than FRB to include other phenomenon, and if so, have there been any Giga-hertz Astrophysical Transient Emissions observations that are not also considered FRBs?
