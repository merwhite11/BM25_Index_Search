Relation between initial mass and evolutionary phases lifetimes

Consider the following image (Source: An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics):

There seems to be a relation between the initial mass/mass at the beginning of the MS and the time spent during different evolutionary phases.
Is the this relation empirical or can it be quantified? 
For example, the MS lifetime is proportional to $M / L$ , I want to know whether a relationship like this exists for other phases.
Edit 1: 
See this image for more details, does there exist any quantitative relation from which these values can be obtained?
