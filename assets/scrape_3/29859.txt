What is the solar system orientation to its direction of travel?

I saw the picture and seem incorrectly drawn. Its shows the the edge of the solar system leading facing the Heliosheath. It would not be like NASA to post something as incorrect as this. The solar system should at 60 degrees to the direction of travel?
I'm not sure maybe this picture is correct?
