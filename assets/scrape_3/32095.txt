How to calculate planetary positions hundreds or thousands of years ago

Wondering how to calculate the following in a general way:

Sunrise/sunset
Equinoxes/solstices
Moon phases
Planetary positions

For hundreds to thousands of years ago. Wondering what the calculation is, or where I go about figuring it out.
I would like to be able to say, in 1541 on Jan 1 the sun rose at x time, Jupiter was in y position, etc.
