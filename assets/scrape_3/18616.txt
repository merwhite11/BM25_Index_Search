Which camera body is best introduction for beginner amateur astrophotographer?

I currently own an old 1980s Celestron eight inch orange tube schmidt cassegrain telescope with tripod. I am seriously looking to dive into some astrophotography. 
I also own an olympus pen epl3 camera. It's great for photos during my hikes, but not quite as versatile as an DSLR. Unfortunately, I know of no software out there which can tether this camera to my laptop. I don't have any great ideas on remotely controlling this camera to avoid shaking my telescope.
I'm thinking of getting a DSLR at some point anyway.
Is there a camera body that anyone would recommend for me?
