In the closest stars, can you see the stellar corona?

Stars appear larger than they are, could that be the stellar corona here around Sirius, making it appear n-times larger than the stellar body? NASA recently mapped the solar corona to extending 12 solar radii above the surface 1, the corona as a whole occupying 13x the suns diameter if viewed from a distance.
