3000th Question: What does the future of astronomy look like with the next generation of telescopes?

What will the benefits and advantages be of the upcoming generation of telescopes such as LSST, E-ELT and JWST? And more broadly where will this leave astronomy in 10-20 years time?
This isn't a direct duplicate of (What are the next planned space telescopes?) because I want to know what the aims and benefits of such telescopes are, and what new ones might have been planned since.
