What is this gap between hot and cold Jupiters?

When plotting mass to semi major axis on exoplanets.org, there seems to be a gap between Hot Jupiters and Cold Jupiters. A lot of Jupiter-mass planets at less than 0.1 AU have been discovered, and a lot at more than 1 AU, but there aren't so many in between. 

Since many planets closer and further away from their star have been discovered for the same mass, it seems unlikely that this gap would be due to observational bias.
