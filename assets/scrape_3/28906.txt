Can blackholes appear white and black?

Depending on the angle you view a black hole could it appear white, black or grey? Excluding how the gravitational lensing would make all the light emitted either red or blue shifted creating a rainbow effect from the accretion disk from and remove all the other light sources. 
Could a black hole appear black from the side where matter enters and white from the top where the jet is emitted?
