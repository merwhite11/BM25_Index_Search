Why is 3GHz the best frequency at which to measure the sun's microwave output?

I have read that 3GHz is the best frequency at which to measure the sun's microwave output, but that measurements are made at 2.8GHz for historical reasons, however I can find no explanation of why 3GHz should be the best frequency.
Could anyone tell me please?
