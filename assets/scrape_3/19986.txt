Solar Spectral Types and Dwarf Stars

On the following page, 
http://www.uni.edu/morgans/astro/course/Notes/section2/spectraltemps.html
It mentions Main, Giants and SuperGiants.
However for Dwarf Stars (e.g. D, Sd) , do I apply Main Sequence to the solar type?
For other types, IV, II, do I apply Main Sequence / Subgiant / Giant to the type?
If you look at the linked webpage, you'll see it mentions Types (V,III,I) but for instance where would Procyon (F5IV-V), Sargas (F1II) fit or should there be a different table for types IV, II?
Would groups (D, sd, IV,m II) have a different table?  Rigil Kentaurus (G2V) would clear fit into Main Sequence.
