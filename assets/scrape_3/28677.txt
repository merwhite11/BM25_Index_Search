What would happen if someone had a telescope and watched Betelgeuse when it goes supernova?

Would that person go blind?   
Neutrino detectors and the abundance of Neutrinos would detect the upcoming visible show about 3 hours before any visible signs, so there would be time to point certain telescopes that could handle the brightness towards it.    
I'm curious if an individual with a telescope pointed in that direction would have an unpleasant surprise.    Would the scientific community be wise to not announce the massive stellar explosion until after it's visible to avoid potential negative effects from over-eager amateur astronomers.
I realize this is a kind of silly question and it might depend too much on the telescope, but I'm curious.
