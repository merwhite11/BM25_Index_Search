Intercept a NEO trajectory

I need help with an exercise in the book that I can't tackle. I need to calculate how much time we have to intercept and eliminate a NEO. I got the following orbital parameters:

a=-2791.44 km (semi-major axis), 
i=22.3 deg /Hyperbolic), 
e=2.77 
v=247.96 deg, 
r= 2,106,101.331 km (radius from Earth's center of mass)

My problem is that I don't know where to begin, but I did an attempt. I assume that the intercept with the target only can happen when the phase angle between Earth and the NEO are the same. 
I know that one can calculate the velocity of the S/C with ($m_y$=gravitational param.):
$$v=\sqrt{(2m_y/r)-(m_y/a)}$$ 
If we calculate the escape velocity of the Earth with $V_e=\sqrt{2GM_e/r}$, we will get the difference in velocity. With this information, we can calculate the time needed.  Anyone that can help me?
