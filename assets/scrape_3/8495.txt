How can I predict space directions?

Did the Neptune and Pluto trajectories ever cross or was it a mere reclassification? Do studies say that I can predict an intersection between 2 trajectories  or movements based on data now? Do I have to consider at least 3 solid or larger space bodies moving in a way like the 3-body problem?
