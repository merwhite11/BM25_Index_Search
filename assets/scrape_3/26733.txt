Why do photos of Earth always have a black background?

if we are in the milky way, and people are able to take photographs from Earth that look like this:

Then how come almost all of Earth's photos look like this?

In the first photo, we are seeing what is "outside Earth", and so if we actually went "outside Earth", why don't we see these gases?
Is it because of the Sun blinding our vision? Suppose a satellite was hovering over the part of Earth where its night time (very little sun interference). If it "turned around and faced the opposite direction from earth", it would see the void, but would it see all these gases, or just the black void.
Why?
