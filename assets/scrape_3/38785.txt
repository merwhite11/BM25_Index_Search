Why both sunrise and sunset use the position of the sun's upper limb?

It is my understanding, that astronomical moments of both rise and set use the relative position of background object's upper limb to the foreground object's horizon.
When were these definitions formulated?
Is this done purely because sunrise and sunset are the main examples of such events and it is easier for the naked eye to tell when sun is completely below horizon?
Wouldn't this offset the symmetry of rotations (since the "day" is always longer than the "night" by the duration it takes the background object to move fully below the foreground horizon)?
