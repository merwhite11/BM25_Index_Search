Information on Planetary nebula formed from the death of our star the 'Sun'!

I want to know the expansion rate, composition, mass and density of hydrogen present of a Planetary nebula similar to that which will be formed after the death of our star the sun. 
Knowing these data is important for me to do some calculations.
