Does New Moon Affect Stargazing After MoonSet?

Referencing the following data for December 11th 2017.
https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/@4799274?month=12&year=2017
To get a dark sky for stargazing does it matter if the moon is at 37.8% so long as it is below the horizon when I'm observing? 
Since the moon will be set at 1:32PM on the 11th and not rise again until 1:59AM on the 12th I would assume the moon would not affect viewing between those times. 
Furthermore is there a guideline as to how close to moonrise the moon will start to have an affect?
