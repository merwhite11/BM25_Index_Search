Eyepieces and accessories recommendations for a Starblast 4.5-inch scope in a city as well as darker suburbs, and kid friendly?

For the Starblast 4.5 Telescope I currently have an Orion 7-21mm Zoom eyepiece attached on top of a 2x Barlow lens. I like them because of the magnification they give stacked together and the zoom eyepiece has a good eye relief which is very kid-friendly, and the zoom function is very convenient to find things quickly by zooming in and out without changing eyepieces or focus.
Are there other eyepieces or accessory (or better ones) I can buy for better viewing of the brighter Messier star nebulae and galaxies specifically under

a) a city environment with lots of light pollution
and/or
b) a darker suburb location?

Please specify if the accessory equipment is good for a) or b), or both. Thanks!
Here are the specs for the Starblast:

Aperture: 4.5 inch aperture
Focal length: 450mm
Focal ratio: f/4 focal ratio
Came with two Explorer II 1.25 inch Kellner telescope eyepieces (17mm and 6mm)

Thank you!
