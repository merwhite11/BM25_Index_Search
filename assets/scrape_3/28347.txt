In the calculation of GMST, what are these constants?


GMST = 6.697374558 + 0.06570982441908 D0 + 1.00273790935 H + 0.000026 T2

From the GMST calculation on the USNO website (and many other places) we encounter these constants:

6.697374558
0.06570982441908
1.00273790935

Can someone enlighten me as to what they represent?
