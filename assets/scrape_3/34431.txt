How does the field decay of a magnetar power the emission of high-energy electromagnetic radiation?

In Space.com's Dr. Pulsar and Mr. Magnetar? 2 Star Types May Turn into Each Other (and in the linked video) "Tom Prince, a physics professor at the California Institute of Technology and a senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory" is quoted as saying:

First, magnetars don't last long — just a year to a few years, before colossal waves of X-rays dissipate the magnetic energy...

and Wikipedia's Magnetar says:

A magnetar is a type of neutron star believed to have an extremely powerful magnetic field (∼1013 to 1015 G, ∼109 to 1011 T)1. The magnetic field decay powers the emission of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, particularly X-rays and gamma rays2.

Question: How does the field decay of a magnetar power the emission of high-energy electromagnetic radiation?
More specifically:

Is it as simple as $\partial \mathbf{B} / \partial t$ produces an electric field which accelerates charged particles that happen to be there, and then those accelerating particles radiate photons? 
Does the energy radiated by these photons cary any significant fraction of the total energy in the field?
Is the word done producing these photons the reason that the magnetic field decays?
