Are exo-meteoroids possible?

Is it possible that meteoroids, comets, asteroids or other small bodies from around a nearby star (such as Alpha Centauri) could get into the solar system?
How low is that possibility?  
Edit:
Since the Oort Cloud is not being gravitationally attracted enough to the Sun to form a disk, I assume this is the same for Alpha Centauri's Oort cloud. Therefore, my question is: can the Sun gravitationally pull a comet from Alpha Centauri's Oort cloud?
