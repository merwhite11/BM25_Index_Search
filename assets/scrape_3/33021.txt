Can an Earth-like planet survive if our Sun went Supernova?

First, I would like to point out, yes, our sun does not have enough mass to be a candidate for Supernova, this is a scenario were our sun is though, and after the various life cycle stages of the sun and whether or not life managed to survive or not on the planet, The Sun goes of as a Supernova, it is 1 AU from an Earth-like planet, or equivalent to 1 AU from a massive star, would the planet still be standing or would it be obliterated from the face of the Galaxy?
Here are some of the links that I have been looking through but could not find an answer for:
