Between Mercury and Venus, which planet produces a longer transit? Assuming both planets describe same path on the solar disk

Is it even possible to give a definite answer to this question? There are a lot of factors involved in this like Earth's position and motion relative to the planets and of course their own motion and apparent sizes in earth's sky.
Or is it that obvious that Venus transit will be longer because its orbital speed is less than Mercury?
