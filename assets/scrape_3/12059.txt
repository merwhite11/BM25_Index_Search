Existence of multiple universe?

In this youtube video, Prof. Michio Kaku mentions there could be multiple universes and if there are, then there could be a worm hole to some other universe.
My question is: We are not sure if the Multiverse exists, so how can we believe or have imagined that worm holes could exist and create a path to another universe?
