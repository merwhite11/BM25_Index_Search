How do accretion disks around black holes evaporate via winds?

I'm curious as to how accretion disks around black holes evaporate. I've heard winds play a crucial role in this. But what winds specifically and how do they form? Is it a stellar wind of sorts? If so how effective would it be?
I've also heard radiation pressure causes these winds, but that shouldn't work unless the black hole is still in an X-ray binary. Any help is appreciated.
