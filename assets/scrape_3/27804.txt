What phenomena was this video from SOHO actually showing?

My friend showed me a video of a CME that looked as if it was swirling into a gigantic circular "spaceship" or "UFO" and he explained it as "an alien ship potentially refueling". I did a bit of research and I know assumed the images he was showing me were from SETI SOHO and they were yellow, meaning it was obviously only a single or a couple wavelengths of light shown (possibly UV?).

If yoy habe the original source that would be awesome.
Making a total BLIND guess- I'd say the plasma was swirling into the filament of the CME before it reached a critical mass to be pushed away from the sun? Once departed from the energy of the sun under certain conditions it would no longer show because it wouldn't have enough energy to emit the correct wavelength of light?
Am I even remotely correct? Obviously the space ship explanation has no merit- it's just from some dude. Hoping to get a clarification on the video, I do not believe it is a "UFO refueling" heh. Im not a conspiracy nut, and neither is my bud- so we're looking for a science answer :).
