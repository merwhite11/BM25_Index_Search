What does the term alien planet actually refer to?

This article left me wondering what do they mean by the term alien planet? Aren't all planets simply alien by default, or do they mean planets outside our solar system are alien? Do they mean there is alien life there? Is this a a new keyword the astronomy community is using to generate more buzz and get more attention to their articles?
