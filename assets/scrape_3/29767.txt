How harmful is Saturn's magnetic field for human life?

AFAIK, Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field in the solar system, and it's so powerful that I've been told humans only could survive the radiation generated by it in its mooon Callisto, with proper protection. 
But how about Saturn? Saturn has the second strongest magnetic field in the solar system. Which moons of Saturn could men survive from the radiation generated by the planet's magnetic field in?
