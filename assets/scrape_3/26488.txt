what kind of telescope eyepieces is best for viewing planets up close

ok so I am a total amateur when it comes to telescopes and lens, and this is probably a pretty stupid question, but I am trying to find a lens/eyepiece that is good for viewing Jupiter and Saturn up close, and I have no idea what I am looking for, I have an Orion Sky Quest XT8 plus reflector telescope, (not sure if that matters) but if someone knows what I am looking for pls lmk, thx Noelle:)
