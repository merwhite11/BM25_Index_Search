What's the origin and culture of funny astronomical terminology?

I'm not in the industry myself, but as an interested member of the public the terminology of astronomy seems a bit funny. Astronomers who today talk publicly about the interstellar medium say that the solar system is in the "local fluff" inside the "local bubble" near a "local chimney". Cosmology uses a term like "the dark ages" to describe an era in the history of the phenomena they study. But geologists instead prefer to use terms like "cenozoic" to name a period. Early on, astronomers also used pompous words and names from antique languages. 

Was "Big Bang" (coined in 1949, I think) the term which started off this fluffy bubble blob bang type of terminology? Or were there precursors?
Is there a connection to sci-fi literature?
Are the "blobby bang fluff" words just a mass media ("reach out") construction which professional astronomers don't use at all even as quick references in conversations with colleagues?
