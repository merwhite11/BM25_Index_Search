can we see all binary stars as pairs?

As it is obvious from the question title 
is there any restriction or cases that we can see the binary stars as not in pairs 
also is there any binary stars doesn't linked together by gravity ?
I know the definition of binary stars that it is  a pair of stars that revolve around their common center of mass but my question is about special cases if it is exist
