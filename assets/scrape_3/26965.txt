Yet another Question about the expansion of universe

A galaxy 13 billion light-years distant is 94% of the way to the big bang. The universe was 800 million years old when the light was emitted. That galaxy today is traveling away from us at 94% of the speed of light roughly. So 13 billion years ago it was 750 million light years away from us. Assuming the expansion is NOT greater than light speed, that photon did NOT go backward. This is also evidenced by the fact that the photon arrived at earth. It seems to me the photon took 13 billion years to cross 750 million light years. What am I doing wrong?
   Question two. If this is right then please explain how we go from 750 (or 800) million light years to 46.5 billion light years.
