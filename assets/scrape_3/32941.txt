If the earth stopped spinning what would happen to the moon

A question was posed at work today, "if the earth stopped spinning what would happen to the moon"? Ignoring any effects on the Earth, what actually happens to the Moon? Does it continue to orbit the now non-rotating Earth, or does it fly off into space like a massive asteroid, or more likely some other thing that I can't conceive of? 
Note, the Earth stops spinning, not orbiting the sun. 
For additional curiosity, what would be the differences if this were an extremely gradual slowing vs an almost instantaneous stoppage?
