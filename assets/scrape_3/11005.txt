How accurate are rederings of something entering Earth's atmosphere?

Supposedly how accurate is it when you see a movies showing something entering Earth's atmosphere traveling 1 mile to 10 miles an hour or barely at all but skinning the atmosphere they show it heating up and burning just by entering the atmosphere no speed or barely just entering?
As a second question, something coming in - say, a vehicle with rockets - to ensure that the speed does not exceed that would cause  any heating at all. What speed would that be?
