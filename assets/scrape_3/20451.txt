Is it unlikely for a meteor to hit the day side of the earth?

I have binge watched a lot of documentaries and movies about meteors hitting the earth. The one pattern I have seen, even in the science-fact documentaries like Nova, is that the animations show meteors hitting the earth on the day side. By that, I mean at a near 90Â° angle in the center of the day zone. As if it were to hit the earth at high noon. 
What seems unlikely to me is where the meteor hits. It seems intuitive to me that statistics would favor a meteor strike on the night side of the planet rather than the day side. Or, possibly from the transition between day and night if the meteor came in from the side.
Is my suspicion correct? Is it unlikely for a meteor to hit the earth on the day side and far more likely to hit the night side?
To clarify, I'm thinking of significant meteor strike, like the Chicxulub impact  that killed off the dinosaurs. If something that massive came in from the day side, wouldn't it more likely to have been captured or redirected by the sun because of the sun's gravity?
