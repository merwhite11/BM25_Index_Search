cosmic-microwave-background - 2.7 degrees but does the Big Bang care?

The Big Bang is a proposed answer to the beginning of the universe, and the Cosmic Microwave Background or CMB is a central part of the evidence for it.
Now suppose the measurement returned a different value than 2.7K.
What if it were 0.27K or 27K?  Would the Big Bang theory still work with a few minor adjustments or is the specific temperature of 2.7K critical evidence that the theory works?
Edit: I have removed a paragraph which was not mine asking about small changes in temperature. It is a fundamentally different question. I am more interested in how firm the evidence for the BB theory is, not its details. At least for this question. 
However if uhoh who seems to have done the editing thinks it a fair question, I would certainly welcome it - in another post.
