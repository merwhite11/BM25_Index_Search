What's the useful magnification for a scope with 70mm objective lens?

Some of the spotting scopes which are e.g. 70mm claim to magnify terrestrial objects at 75x. But yet they cannot produce sharp and clear images at even 30x-35x.
While 90mm scopes can do a better job than them but still they stop  producing clear view at higher magnification.
So, I want to know is there a formula from which I can estimate (if not accurately tell) their useful magnification at which they are able to focus objects?
I came across this:
Magnification = Focal length / Eye piece focal length

But not sure if that works for what I am asking.
