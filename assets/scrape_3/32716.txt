Does anybody recognize this kind of prism?

Supplemental to this answer to Did Edmund Scientific 4¼ inch Newtonians have 90° prisms as secondary mirrors in the 1970's? I was poking around a bit further and ran across this "1960's Edmund Scientific 'Space Conqueror', 3" reflector" with a prism diagonal at http://www.retrotechnology.com/glass/edmund.html
Question: Does anybody recognize what kind of prism this is? It doesn't look like a simple right-angle prism, but possibly something that has additional reflections and does some additional flipping or rotation.
Is there any chance that it isn't positioned correctly, it doesn't look like it is centered along the eyepiece holder's axis, but the image has a strong perspective component and we can't see the business end of the prism.
