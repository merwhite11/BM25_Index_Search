North node, South node correct understanding

What is the correct concept of the North node and South node? There is some conflicting information on the internet.
Which one of these two is correct?
1. Sourced from some Astrology material - How can North and South be 180-degree opposites in this since these are on one side of the orbit curve?

2.From Wikipedia source - This seems incorrect too since there is no "separate" Moon orbit as per around the Sun
