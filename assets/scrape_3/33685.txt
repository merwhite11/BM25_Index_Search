Why was Dawn's (the spacecraft) flight path circular?

In comparison to the twin Voyagers, Dawn's flight path circled the sun in an anti-clockwise manner. The map of its path shows its targets, Ceres and Vesta were in a trajectory that was close to a straight path, if Dawn had taken a clockwise direction, with a close flyby of Mars. I can't find a reason to show it was studying the space around Lagrange point 3 (in relation to Earth), as according to this flight path map. So what was the reason for a longer direction?
