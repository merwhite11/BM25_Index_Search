Is it practical to build a giant telescope in Moon? (Considering the fact that the atmosphere of moon is very rare)

China's FAST (Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope) is the largest radio telescope in the world.(This is huge!!!)

As we all know Space Telescopes are better than Earth-Based telescopes always.(Hubble space telescope was such a tremendous success)Even though ground-based observatories are usually located in highly elevated areas with minimal light pollution, but still they contend with atmospheric turbulence, which limits the sharpness of images taken from this vantage point.
What if all the space agencies collaborate together to build a telescope half the size of China's FAST in moon(Even smaller than half),even then it will be more powerful than the "FAST" right(because the atmosphere of moon is very less dense)?Will it be impractical?It may take decades to build one but still the outcome will be huge(We may even look and find aliens!!)
(Taking in account that Elon Musk is already planning Colonization of Mars)This project looks somewhat tamable than that,right?  Is there a possibility of this happening? Is it feasible enough?
