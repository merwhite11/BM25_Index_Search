Is it possible for two stars to be in a horseshoe orbit around a much larger star?

I was reading about how Saturn has two moons, Janus and Epimetheus, that swap orbits once every four years. Could something like this happen on a much larger scale, but with stars instead of a planet and moons? Let's say you had a large, massive star with two red dwarfs orbiting around it. Could those two red dwarf stars fall into a horseshoe orbit, regularly swapping orbits every few years or so?
