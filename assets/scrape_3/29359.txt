3 years later, how strong is the evidence for planet 9?

I came across post in quora where somebody said that "most astronomers no longer think Planet 9 exists" and being somewhat shocked by that, I did a google search and found a fairly recent article that claims exactly that.
It can take several years to prove a negative within pretty good certainty, as opposed to a discovery which can be checked pretty quickly.   Because I don't want to wait several years, I wanted to ask if the general consensus is that Planet 9 probably doesn't exist?  Or is there still a respectable amount of belief among astronomers in the original evidence and any new evidence that's followed?
If it ends up not existing, I'll be sorry to hear it.   It was a fun story when it lasted.
