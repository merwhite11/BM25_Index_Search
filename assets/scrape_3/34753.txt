When can the Sun, Moon and the five naked-eye planets all be in Leo?

What are the possible dates for the seven (classical/mediaeval) planets (Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Venus) all being in Leo? 
I’m not sure how to figure this out on my own. I’m interested in this for the purposes of historical dating. Example: the planetary positions are recorded in art. These positions are only possible every so often and I’d like to know the possibilities. 
Here’s one of the example. This is called the Metternich Stele, named after the Prince who received it shortly after its discovery. 
Here’s the first drawing of it by the Russian Egyptologist V. S. Golenishchev.
