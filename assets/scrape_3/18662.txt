Auroras: is there any bump in frequency at certain times of night, or times of year?

I'm trying to find out if there is a range of times at night, and/or days during the year, in which the probability of seeing an aurora is higher than average. 
The aurora section of the British Astronomical Association asserts that there's 
a correlation with season (higher probability near equinoxes), and a correlation with 'magnetic midnight'.

Are these assertions correct? If so, what is the definition of magnetic midnight, exactly?
