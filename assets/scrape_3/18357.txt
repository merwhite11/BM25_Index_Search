Can the difference between a star and a galaxy which are point sources be detected?

Obviously a star would be a point source. A galaxy should be an irregular blob if close, but if it is far away then it would seem that a galaxy too would be just a point source. 
Given that the star and galaxy were both only detectable as point sources can astronomers tell them apart with redshift? By some other method?
A followup question...
What percentage of galaxies if our universe can we only detect as point sources?
