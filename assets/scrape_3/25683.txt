Do hypervelocity stars have Oort clouds?

If you had a hypervelocity star travelling through space incredibly quickly, would the hypervelocity star's Oort cloud remain intact? Would the high speed of a hypervelocity star shed the comets and dwarf planets in its Oort cloud due to the star's high speeds, or would the Oort cloud get stretched into a teardrop shape? Could the Oort cloud remain unaffected?
