Supposed SN 1006 was only 4 lightyears away what would the blasts impact be like on earth?

One of the commenters on my answer to https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/a/86733/3460 questions that the blast would even have a noticeable impact if that supernova was in Alpha Centauri. And since my answer is just based on my intuition, I would like to figure that out.
So radiation put aside, what would the blast of SN 1006 be like for earth when arriving, supposed it went supernova just 4 light-years away?
