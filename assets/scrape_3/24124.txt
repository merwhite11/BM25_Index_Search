Behaviour of black holes

This question could be strictly linked to my another question related to black holes.
It’s known that the  horizon event is a place where dust,star components are ready to be incorporated to the black hole*.
Actually, my question can be divided in few points:

Might be reasonable to believe that ,if it’s true that in many spiral galaxies there is a black hole in the middle, could these objects have so a powerful gravitational force to consider them the creators of the galaxies?
(*) when the black holes are sucking up dust from the horizon event, are they increasing their mass?

If so, it’s reasonable to believe that their gravitational force will increase in a way to attract farther objects?
Could they eject the dust or anything else if they are “eating” so much?
This can be in contradiction with above point.
