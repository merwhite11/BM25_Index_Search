What was the first astronomical measurement which demonstrated that "the Earth is surrounded by vacuum"?

The question Who was the first to realize that the Earth is surrounded by vacuum? was closed because some users felt it was answered by answers to a different question in an different SE site: Who was the first to postulate that space was a vacuum?
To me the distance between realize and postulate is astronomical!
That aside, I've asked a new question: What was the first astronomical measurement which demonstrated that "the Earth is surrounded by vacuum"?
By demonstrated I'm talking about a measurement that shows it is, or at least is likely to be the case that Earth is surrounded by vacuum. It should be something such that it could be presented as scientifically convincing evidence to other scientists of the time, unencumbered by non-scientific predispositions (e.g. religion, rivalry, philosophy...)
