Circular formation around the moon

I have seen a large circular formation of cloud around the full moon sometimes.
Have anyone seen the same? What is the reason behind this formation?
Due to lunar attraction?
Most of the sky is empty and clear, and no clouds at all, only around the moon, far from the moon, not just very close, that cloud circle formed. 
I saw this many times, like the below drawing:
