Supermoon Lunar Eclipse?

I recently read this article: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/supermoon-lunar-eclipse-coming-this-month/ I'm having some trouble understanding how a "supermoon" lunar eclipse is possible. 
Judging from this diagram, it would seem that the moon always reaches its apsides above or below the orbital plane of the earth around the sun, making any kind of eclipse at these points impossible. Can someone clarify for me? 
Thank you.
