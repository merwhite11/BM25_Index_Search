Are gravitational waves part of dark energy?

Do the current models of the universe consider the energy release of gravitational waves?
E.g. iirc, the last black hole merger detected had a gravitational wave energy equal to ~3 solar masses (hope I'm not mistaken in this fact).
Same for other mergers, and supernovae: the energy related to their gravitational waves should sum up to something.
