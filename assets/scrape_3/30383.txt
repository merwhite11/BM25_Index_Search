What resolution would earth-moon telescope achieve?

Event horizon achieved earth-size telescope by using  seperate telescopes around the world to interpolate an image of a black hole at resolution of 60 arcmicroseconds.
What resolution could we get if we built radio telescopes on the moon and used earth-moon orbit to interpolate an image? What could we see with it?
What if we used earth-moon-mars telescope?
Would it make sense to go even bigger?
This is all assuming we would have possibilities to build local telescopes like ones on earth in future.
