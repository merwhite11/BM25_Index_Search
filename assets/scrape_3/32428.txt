Are all satellites thought to be the result of collisions with the planets?

The leading hypothesis for how the Moon was formed was that another object collided with the Earth, throwing off a large lump of matter which formed into the moon.
Is this thought to be the case with all satellites? e.g. Phobos, Deimos, Charon, Titan, Europa, etc. ? If not, then why do we need such a dramatic "origin story" for the Moon but not the others? Why do we not just assume the Moon was formed the same way as all satellites?
