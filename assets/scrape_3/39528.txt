The possibility of rapidly changing the Earths orbit via a passing astronomical object

I assume that the Earth could be “gently” (without colossal tidal or volcanic catastrophe) displaced by a passing extra solar star, brown dwarf or planet and end up perhaps 10% further away from the Sun?
If so how quickly could this be achieved?
I suppose it would depend on the details, but roughly what combination of distance of approach and mass of object would be best to use for use in a realistic fictional setting? incidentally I assume the orbits of outer planets might well be much more badly affected.
