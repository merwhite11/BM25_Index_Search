How can we tell that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy?

From Earth, we can distinguish the type of another galaxy very easily simply by observing the shape, colour, and structure of the galaxy when we image it. But since we are located inside the Milky Way, we cannot get an "outside view". Thus, how can we tell if we are located in either a spiral or an elliptical galaxy?
