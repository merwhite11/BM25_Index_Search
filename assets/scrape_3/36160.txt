Google Sky Rectangle with No Stars

I've been viewing Google Sky, which is quite amazing, and came across a rather expansive rectangle where no stars are visible at 22h13m04.44s   4Â°59'29.49" (see image below). My only thought is that there's probably a satellite or something up there that Google is required to hide. Any thoughts on what this is?
