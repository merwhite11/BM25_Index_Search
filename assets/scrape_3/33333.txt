What equipment do I need to measure the spectrum of a star?

For an amateur astronomer, is it possible to measure the spectrum of a star?
I can easily take a photo of a star just by putting a camera on one end of a telescope and over exposing it.
But I would like to measure the spectrum of a star. I imagine I could do some crude approximation by using different filters. But I would like the full spectrum to see what the composition of a star is.
How would I go about this?
