Focal ratio importance for planetary viewing

It seems that almost every article online regarding planetary viewing recommends a telescope with a high focal ratio (f/8 or more), for revealing the finer details of the planets. But I find this a bit confusing because the resolving power of a telescope is solely a function of the aperture, or at least that is my understanding.
Given the above, shouldn't it be a matter of a large enough aperture and then the eyepiece to use to zoom on the detail of choice in formed image?
