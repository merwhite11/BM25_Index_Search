Can rogue/nomad planets and other starless planetary bodies orbit each other in a stable system?

Nomad planets (also called planemos or rogues planets) which drift in space without  a star or substellar object to orbit. The majority of such planets we have discovered are gas planets with thick atmospheres and no landmass, although some of them could be frozen deserts with rocky surfaces like Earth's. 
Most nomad planets we have found are alone/solitary, and do not orbit any other companion objects. We have only discovered 1 (as in 1.0) binary planemo called 2MASS J11193254â€“1137466.
What I'm asking here is that can a large system of 6 or 7 rogue planets and other planetary bodies orbit each other and remain stable; basically like a tiny open cluster or huge multiple star system, just comprised of planets instead of stars?
