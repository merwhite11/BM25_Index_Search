Can lunar occultation of Venus occur during solar eclipse?

Moon can occult Venus. Venus can transit across the solar disc. Moon can elipse Sun. Can all three celestial events occur at the same time - Moon is at front of Sun (partial eclipse is fine) and Venus is behind Moon (ideally part of the planets is seen at lunar limb)? Observer is at Earth.
