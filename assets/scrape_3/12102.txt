Does 2 merging black holes necessarily make a quasar?

2 black holes are about to merge to become a larger black hole. Does this mean it'll become a quasar?
From what I know, quasars are supermassive black holes or a collective amount of them. So, if it merges and becomes a supermassive black hole, does this mean that it is a quasar? If the size is smaller than what would be considered as a supermassive black hole would it not be a quasar?
