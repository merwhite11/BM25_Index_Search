Why can we observe the Cosmic Microwave Background no matter the direction we look?

I often read that the CMB was released from everywhere in the Universe, in every direction. 
If that statement is true, can someone elaborate what "everywhere in the universe, in every direction" means ? If not, why can we observe it in every direction ?
