Is there an established distinction between a geyser and a cryovolcano in solar system bodies?

Is there an established distinction between a geyser and a cryovolcano in the context of cold solar-system bodies such as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, or Kuiper belt objects (e.g. Pluto)? 
Both can lead to spreading of new water across the surface, and both can result in plumes of water vapor above the surface. Do they have distinctly different mechanisms?
Or is it unclear or in a state of flux, a bit like the diagram in @zephyr's answer to Do astronomers generally agree that the distinction between comets and astroids is not so clear?
