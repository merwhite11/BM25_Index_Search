If the solar system is nearly flat, then why don't all the planets appear to lie on the same axis when viewed from earth?

For instance, consider the image below. The location of the planets seem to be so random relative to Earth. If the solar system was indeed flat, then I would expect the planets to lie on the same 'plane', and relative to us, it would look something like the second image. I mean, maybe Jupiter and Mars and Saturn could be on the same plane, but I fail to see how Venus would be.
What is wrong with my understanding here?
