how does Kepler stop exposure after a 5 minuate or 30 minute cadence time?

There are two kinds of cadence time for Kepler, 5 minutes and 30 minutes.
I just know there is no shutter and the CCDs of Kepler can be locked after exposure. handbook
But how to realize that? Remember we have to not affect the photometry.
The other question is so far how many unique sources has Kepler observed? 160,000?
