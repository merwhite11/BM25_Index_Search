How did the Earth come to be in orbit around the sun?

I'm not sure if this post should be in the physics subject forum, but this seems to fit here too. I have been reading a book about chemistry and how the universe came to be with the theory of stars creating most of the elements we know of. I began wondering how the Earth came to be in orbit around the Sun. I understand that we are in a constant free fall towards the Sun, but our motion causes us to "miss" the Sun stopping us from burning up. However, I'm confused how we were put into motion in the first place. My best guess is that we were captured by the Sun's gravity, and were put into orbit, which would mean the Earth was once a meteor, right? If someone could please explain this, it'd be very helpful because I can't seem to find the answer anywhere.
Thank you
P.S. I'm just a 9th grader, so I don't have much knowledge in astrophysics.
