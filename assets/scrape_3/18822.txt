Have I misunderstood Hipparcos Data with Arcturus?

If I take Arcturus for example, its HipID is 32349 and when i look at the raw Hip_Main.dat, it stays that the star's Spectral is K2IIIp whilst Wikipedia says the star's is KOIII.  Why the discrepancy, have I misunderstood the Hip data?
Mu Cephei is M2e Ia, in Hip its m2Ia.
Achernar is B6 Vep whereas in Hip its B3Vp
Zosma for example, matches, I get A4V in the Hip file and it says A4 V in Wiki.
