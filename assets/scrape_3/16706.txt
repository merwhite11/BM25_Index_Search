Is the radius used in the formula for the escape velocity the average radius of the celestial object or the radius at the starting location?

I learnt that the escape velocity is given by $$v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$$
Say I want to launch a rocket from the earth into space and want to calculate the escape velocity $v_e$ (I guess without air resistance). Which value of $r$ do I have to use:

The mean radius of the earth...
... or the distance between the center of mass of the earth and the launch location?

Thanks in advance.
