How much oxygen did the Warwick/Cambridge study find in the rocky debris around white dwarf GD 61?

There are several articles out saying that a Warwick/Cambridge study of ultraviolet spectroscopy data from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope found a large amount of oxygen in rocky debris around the white dwarf GD 61. They say that this amount of oxygen is indicative of a larger mass (asteroid), that was once composed of the rocky debris, which was 26% water.

What I cannot seem to find is how much oxygen the spectroscopic examination found. Also, what methods did they use to determine how much water there would have been based on the level of oxygen?
