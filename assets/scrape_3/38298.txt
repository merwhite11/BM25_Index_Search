Can we change Earth's orbit with modern technology?

It is well known that, according to Newton's 3rd law, spacecrafts entering or leaving Earth provoke tiny (insignificant) changes to Earth's orbit (see related question here).
My question is about significant changes. For instance, say we would like to shift the Earth's orbit closer to that of Mars (forget about the ecological consequences of this). Do we currently have the technology capable of doing this? For instance, something like a huge nuclear explosion? This question only deals with "natural", non-human ways to change a planet's orbit. I am interested about technology-based changes.
