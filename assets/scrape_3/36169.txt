If the axial tilt of Uranus (97°) was caused by a giant impact, then why do its moons orbit around its equator at the same tilt (≈97°)?

So the most accepted explanation for Uranus' axial tilt is that it once had a normal tilt like the other planets bar Venus (0° to 30°), but then a certain massive object collided with it and flipped it on its side.
But by that logic then shouldn't Uranus' moons be orbiting 0° to 30° relative to the orbital plane? (or whatever mild axial tilt Uranus had before the impact)
If they were formed before when Uranus still had a mild axial tilt then it makes no sense for them to be orbiting directly over present-day Uranus' equator.
