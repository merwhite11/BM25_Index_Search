Celestron NexStar 130 SLT Computerized Telescope GoTo Not Accurate

I am trying to use a Celestron NexStar 130 SLT Computerized Telescope, but I am not able to use the GoTo function.

I do the three start alignment, it confirms matches, 
I make sure the level is exactly level before and after,
I finally punch in a planet to slew to

...and once the telescope has slewed to the planet I see nothing in the eyepiece except pin point dots spread out. 
Also, the words on the hand control are very hard to read because the letters are overlapping each other while the words are panning off the screen. I already tried factory resting which didn't work. The words are in English.
What would my next step be?
