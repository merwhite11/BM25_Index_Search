Does the size of the atom limit the focal length of telescopes?

Does the size of the atom place a theoretical limit on a telescope's focal length (and thus, resolution)?
It seems to me that that the allowed margin of error for parabolic mirrors drops with an increasing focal length. It's already like 25 nm for advanced Earth-based telescopes - which is just 50-250 atoms.
If we try building mirrors with an ever increasing focal length (e. g. as a part of a huge space-based interferometer), will we eventually reach a point where the precision required will be less than the size of the atom and thus no longer achievable? If yes, how far away are we from this limit now?
If we had unlimited resources, would it be possible to construct a space-based telescope for imagining extrasolar planets in great detail, or would this be not even theoretically possible due to the fixed atom size?
