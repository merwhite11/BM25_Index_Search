How can GAIA's accuracy for position, parallax, and annual proper motion for a given star be the same number?

Per Wikipedia's Gaia (spacecraft); Objectives:


Determine the position, parallax, and annual proper motion of 1 billion stars with an accuracy of about 20 microarcseconds (µas) at 15 mag, and 200 µas at 20 mag.


As @RobJeffries painstakingly points out to us in comments below this answer when we talk about parallax as a unit, it is referenced to a baseline of 1 AU. It doesn't refer to the actual cyclic motion seen in the sky due to the orbital motion of whatever is moving around the Sun at its own particular distance.
But the accuracy of both "position" and "annual proper motion" have nothing to do with 1 AU and are measures of positional accuracy of the telescope and how its astrometric data is analyzed.
How can all three of these accuracies simultaneously be 20 µas for 15 magnitude stars?
