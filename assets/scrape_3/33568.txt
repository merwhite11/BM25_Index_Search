Astronomy detective question: what part of the sky are these photos of? What are a few of the stars?

The 9to5Google article Exclusive: Official Pixel 4 camera samples show astrophotography, selfies, more [Gallery] shows some surprisingly nice (at least to me) photos of the Milky Way.
I've asked Milky Way with a cell phone, how is this possible? in Photography SE, but here I'd like to double check the scale and FOV of these images. 
I'd like to establish the FOV and scale in pixels per degree for these images, so I need to know what part of the sky are these photos of and what are a few of the stars? I understand that a wide field view with a cell phone camera may have some distortion so I'll do the corners separately from the center.
I wanted to ask for an estimate of the latitude. I guess that's only possible if we assume the bottom edge is parallel to the horizon.
