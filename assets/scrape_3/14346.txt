Simulates Orbit

I IT developer, and I would code a small program that simulates the orbit of two bodies, the problem of two bodies eventually. 
I have no problem on the part programming but I have a little trouble with the calculations to be done to retrieve the position of the second body that is in orbit around the first. 
Could someone expliqer calculations me or give me a site with a concrete example, such calculations to do to have the orbit of the moon around the earth or the earth around the sun?
