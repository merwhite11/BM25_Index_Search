Why black holes are extremely cold?


"The most massive black holes in the Universe, the supermassive black
holes with millions of times the math [sic] of the Sun will have a
temperature of 1.4 x $10^{-14}$ Kelvin. That's low. Almost absolute zero,
but not quite. A solar mass black hole might have a temperature of
only 0.00000006 Kelvin."

Black holes absorb every form of energy, even light. Absorption of energy should raise its temperature but still it is extremely cold, why?
