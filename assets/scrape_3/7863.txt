Why did the big bang not just produce a big black hole?

Questions I've often wondered about:

If all the matter and energy were concentrated at a single point at the big bang, why wasn't that a black hole, or why didn't it form one?

If the reason #1 above didn't form a black hole is one of several explanations such as inflation or whatever else, then why didn't all the mass and energy form a big black hole at some finite time after this big bang happened?  For instance, I've (possibly incorrectly) heard that inflation made the universe the size of an orange.  Well why didn't it form a black hole then?  Or once the universe expanded to, say, the size of the moon. Why not then? Just insert whatever reasonable size you want in place of "orange" or "moon."  The question is why didn't a black hole form out of all the matter and energy after the Big Bang?
