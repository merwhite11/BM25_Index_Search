How long does a comet "live"?

When a comet loses all his volatile material after many orbits around the Sun, it becomes a "dead" comet (like an asteroid, a centaur or whatever), see for example 2015 TB145.
Is there any way to determine the lifetime of a comet (expressed as the number of orbits before it becomes a dead comet)?
