Are we looking for brown dwarfs where the dark matter has to be?

We have been repeatedly assured that their ain't enough brown dwarfs to account for all the dark matter in our galaxy.
My question is have we been looking in the right places?
Or in more detail. Where exactly does computer modelling put the missing mass? 
I would expect the bulk of it to be on the galaxy's plain and on the edge. And if I am not mistaken there is too much junk in the way to look.
Further I can't see any reason why the dark matter won't be unevenly distributed in clumps just like everything else. 
So, given the above an extrapolation from what we have detected will be way low if it assumes an even distribution in all directions, and horribly low if the LMG and GMG happen to be between clumps.
