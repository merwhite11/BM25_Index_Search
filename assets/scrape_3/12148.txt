Why nuclear fusion is a controlled process in stars?

Nuclear fusion is the main way for stars to generate energy. But we know that nuclear fission and fusion are not controlled, then it causes chain reaction and sudden explosion. But why in the case of stars it does not happen? I mean, that nuclear fusion happen in stars but it take few billion years to complete the amount of hydrogen. Is there any controlling mechanism? If no, what happens here?
