What types of signals is SETI (and other such efforts) looking for?

This seemed to be the closest group for this question.
Every few months there are a few articles asking "Are we alone in the universe" which focus on the Fermi Paradox, the Drake Equation, and end by talking about SETI and its lack of progress. As I understand it SETI is looking for signs of technological civilizations beyond our solar system, both in our galaxy and beyond through radio astronomy. 
My question is about what would count as a "sign" of a technological civilization, and is there a maximum distance beyond which such a signal would be indistinguishable from other radio emissions from stars and galaxies?
