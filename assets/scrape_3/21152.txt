What is the distribution of dark energy?

Dark matter is not distributed evenly. It forms clouds, it concentrates in galaxies, it forms hairs around celestial bodies. 
A google search for dark energy distribution floods me with dark matter distribution results.
How is dark energy distributed? Does it cover the space uniformly, at even density, or does it create areas of concentration or other irregular forms?
