Color changing celestial body near the moon

While I was star gazing yesterday in the night time I observed a celestial body( probably a star ) flaunting various colors and was residing near the moon from the angle I saw it. It appeared to be stationary. Any plausible explanations for this phenomenon? Thanks.
