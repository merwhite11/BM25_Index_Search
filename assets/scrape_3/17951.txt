What are the natural life sustaining resources available in the Jovian moon system?

Hard science fiction writing question.  Premise: what natural resources are present in the Jovian system that would be necessary and desireable to an autonomous, self-sustaining human community?  Water on Europa, for example.  What else? Would like to keep this plausible without a lot of speculation.  Thank you.
