What's the relationship between Moon phase and the Milky Way visibility?

I've been using an IOS app to predict visibility of the Milky Way.
I'm planning a trip to capture the Milky Way on 9th March 2015, but the app shows the visibility will be very weak on that date.
The Moon doesn't even rise until 9:12am.
Does the Moon phase still affect the visibility of the Milky Way even if it is not above the horizon?
