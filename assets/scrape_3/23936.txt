What is the official term for a relationship between a planet and its moons?

Sorry if this is a dumb question, I could not find anything naming this in my astronomy books, and Google searches only seemed to show me pages about astrology, [sarc] because naturally, human relationships are influenced by celestial bodies. [/sarc]
I'm thinking along the lines of a parent-child relationship or a symbiotic relationship, but I couldn't find anything that specifically names this kind of relationship.
Is there an official term for this relationship?
