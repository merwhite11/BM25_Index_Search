Is it likely that intergalactic stars would still retain their planets?

Given that we've discovered hundreds of intergalactic stars (IGs), and that most stars have planets, what do we know about the likelihood of IGs retaining their planets after being ejected from their galaxy?
Related to that, what are the chances of rogue planets being intergalactic as well? If there's a planet floating out in intergalactic space, is it more likely to be orbiting a star, or on it's own?
