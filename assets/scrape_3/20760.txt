Can gravity cause a Big Crunch, if the cosmological principle holds?

Say we have a closed universe that follows the cosmological principle. As a result, mass is distributed equally and, if as far as I know, gravity should have no net effect on the movements of galaxies (as in, there are no peculiar velocities).
However, in the Big Crunch, the Universe stops expanding and gravity causes the scale factor to decrease. How is this possible? Shouldn't gravity have no effect on a homogenous and isotropic universe?
On that note, if gravity actually caused a collapse, would gravity cause the comoving coordinates of the galaxies to change?
