Why are black holes that massive?

Today known most massive star, R136a1  weighs approximately 256 times the mass of our sun, how did supermassive black holes, with a mass of 10 billion times the sun form?
I understand, that when a star becomes black hole, its density increases, but does its mass also grow?
