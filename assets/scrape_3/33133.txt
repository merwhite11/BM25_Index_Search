Textbook to explain measurements and calculations for heliocentric solar system

I'm trying to identify a textbook I had briefly and then lost. I had a PDF file of an astronomy textbook, but the hard drive crashed irreparably before I could thoroughly read the textbook, or even record the author and title.
The textbook covered the history of geocentric theories, explained how to make basic astronomical instruments to measure angles, and how to make arguments for heliocentrism. As I recall, the book mentioned that given high-resolution photography, one can prove heliocentrism by measuring how some celestial bodies appear larger at different times of the year.
I am trying to at least work through the calculations for heliocentrism on paper, even if I don't end up crafting my own instruments. If no one knows of any one textbook that covers all these topics, I would still be grateful for relevant textbooks that cover some of these topics.
Update: It is not a complete answer, but a good start can be found with the ephemeris question asked at:
