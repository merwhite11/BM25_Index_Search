How is the Universe's Expansion Accelerating if the Hubble Constant is Decreasing?

I am just getting into the field of cosmology and was wondering what it means practically to say that the Hubble Constant is decreasing while the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating. I am not sure how this phenomenon is possible. How do we observe this? 
It is my understanding that the Hubble Constant is the rate at which the Universe is expanding, and it is decreasing with time. (Although it is asymptotic)... Is this conception flawed?
