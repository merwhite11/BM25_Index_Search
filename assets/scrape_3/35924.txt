How is the distance of a star from Earth calculated in the HYG star database

The HYG star database can be found here
From the hygdata_v3.csv file, how are the cartesian (x,y,z) coordinates calculated? (Is there a mathematical formula for this?)
And in the dso.csv file, there aren't any x,y,z coordinated. How can I calculate that?
