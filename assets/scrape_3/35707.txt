Size and mass of comet ATLAS (C/2019 Y4)

I read some news about this new comet and some unreliable sources said it is twice as big as Jupiter. I tried to find a reliable estimation of its size or mass, but I couldn't find anything. Would you please provide me a general way to distinguish reliable facts from unreliable facts about comets? Like their size and mass range, how much mass they lose, etc.
