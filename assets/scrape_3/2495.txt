What does "Normalized to Si 10 to the power 6" mean?

I'm writing a space game that I want to give a more "realistic" feel. When looking for a reference as to distribute elements in planets (for mining, etc) Instead of finding the more usual percentage tables, it seems that all elements are presented in a "normalized to Si 10 to the power 6", and furthermore, it seems that the data is presented as number of atoms, instead of actual mass. I've been searching this for days, and even the "parts per million/billion/trillion" tables sometimes just jump for percentages, where is is again no clear if what is being referred to are masses or number of atoms. Could someone clarify this, or better, point me to a mass percentage table of elements in a solar system/galaxy for reference? Thanks in advance.
