If Kepler-444 planets existed for 11.2 billion years, why fear for life on Earth after six billion years?

According to recent news, Kepler-444, a 11.2 billion year old star, has a system of five planets. It has a mass of 3/4 of solar mass. So I believe both Kepler 444 and the Sun will share the fate of 'orange main sequence stars'. If so, while scientists fear for life on Earth in the coming billion years, which is only one sixth for our solar system lifetime, how is it that the Kepler-444 planets have existed for a longer period of time?
