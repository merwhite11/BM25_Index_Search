Is early life required for life?

I was watching the new Cosmos and Neil DeGrasse Tyson said something that made me go hmmm...
He mentioned that the only reason that the Earth did not experience the runaway greenhouse effect like Venus is that life had evolved to the point at which it could feed on carbon and take it out of the atmosphere and deposit it in solid form as limestone.
The question is, if we were to find a planet in the Goldilocks zone, how likely is it that it would be habitable for life without already harboring life?  Would we expect that a similar scenario would have had to taken place on that planet to curb the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, thereby turning it into another Venus?  Can a carbon cycle exist without life?
