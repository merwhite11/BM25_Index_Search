What is the word for space that is in the solar system, but outside the heliopause?

Wikipedia says the definition of interplanetary space is 

the region dominated by the interplanetary medium, which extends out
  to the heliopause where the influence of the galactic environment
  starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the
  Sun

While it defines the solar system as the region in which the sun is the primary gravitational influence

The Sun's gravitational field is estimated to dominate the
  gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light years
  (125,000 AU).

So, if the region outside the heliopause but inside the solar system isn't interplanetary space, then what is it?
