Did we discover 10 or 12 new moons of Jupiter?

I saw multiple news sites reporting that a team discovered 12 new Jupiter's moons:

c|net - Twelve new Jupiter moons found, including one reckless one
Discover - Jupiter’s Got Twelve New Moons — One is a Bit of a Problem Child

While some other news sites claim that they found only 10 new moons:

nature - Jupiter has 10 more moons we didn't know about — and they're weird
EarthSky - Astronomers discover 10 new moons for Jupiter

Why does the number of moons differ in the different articles? Did the team now found 10 or 12 moons?
