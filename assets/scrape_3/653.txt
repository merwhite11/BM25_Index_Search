How do we detect if a planet has a liquid core?

In case of Earth, we have many hints about the internal structure of our planet, from what I know, the most important of which is analyzing seismic waves. 
Do we have any instruments to detect if other solid planets, such as Mars or Venus, have solid or liquid core? Is it possible using remote sensing?
