How many times can iron be detected for the first time in an exoplanetary atmosphere?

I see today that there's a story about the first detection of iron in an exoplanetary atmosphere, in this case in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9b.
I remember there being a story a couple of months ago about the detection of iron rain in an exoplanetary atmosphere, the example being another ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-76b.
It doesn't seem plausible for both of these to be the first detection of iron in an exoplanetary atmosphere. So which one is it?
