Venus-Saturn conjunction in Sagittarius on Dec 11, 2019 - How often does this happen?

Venus and Saturn will be approximately two finger widths apart in the constellation Sagittarius on December 11, 2019. I was wondering: how often do Venus and Saturn come together in the sky like this? I would assume it wouldn't be that frequent. Is it quite frequent? Is there a formula to predict something like this?
