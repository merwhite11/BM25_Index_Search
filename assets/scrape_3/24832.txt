Location of the milky way in August in Death Valley

I am going to be in Death Valley around August 8th. I was hoping to take a milky way shot with my camera when there. I would be shooting around 10pm.
I am using google maps to scout out popular viewpoints in Death Valley for potential locations for the shot, as I will be getting terrestrial objects in the frame.
From what I have read , I believe the milky way will be visible most of the night, and best viewable in the earlier hours of the night. In addition it will be in the south sky. 
So will it be precisely due south? Or will it be slightly south west or south east? If I could pinpoint the location, it would be easier to scout out a spot.
Thanks!
