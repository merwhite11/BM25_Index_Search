stellar metallicity

I saw a talk recently mentioning that another factor that may determine a star's metallicity (besides age) may be how far from the center of its "birth cluster" it is when the short lived hot central stars of the cluster go supernova. I wonder if someone could comment on this. I also wonder if, since now we have better data, have we found more of a continuum of metallicities or is the "Population I, Population II, Population III" idea still going strong??
