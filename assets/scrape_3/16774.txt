Does Big Bang red shift affect the frequency of both light waves and individual photons?

With regard to the wave/particle duality of light, does Big Bang red shift affect both the frequency of light waves, and, the frequency of individual photons? I assume that the e=hf formula relates to individual photons, and not to light waves too?
