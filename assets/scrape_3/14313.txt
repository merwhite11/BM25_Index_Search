At the moment of total solar eclipse what are exact distances of Moon & Sun to the Earth

By total eclipse I mean the Moon and Sun are seen equal in size, neither of them is bigger.
For example, the Moon's average distance is 384000 km and the Sun's average distance is 149.5 million km. But when this distances occurs, are the Moon and Sun seen equal in size? (from Earth of course)
