How would vehicles travel through the interstellar medium with its such low density?

I've heard from a number of different places that the density in the interstellar medium can have an average of 1 atom per centimeter cubed. Perhaps I have a wrong understanding of what 'nothing' is (I am very knew to astronomy/astrophysics), but how would a vehicle, like the Voyager for example, be able to travel through it? 
My (perhaps very flawed) thinking behind this is that if there are so few atoms not in close proximity, there couldn't be any (meaningful) forces interacting between them to provide any sort of way to travel through it.
