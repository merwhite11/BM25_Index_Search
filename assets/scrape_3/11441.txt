How thick can planetary rings be?

This arose from a comment on Worldbuilding.
We have data from four planets in the Solar System with rings, which doesn't make for a very good sample size. Observations of exoplanets could change that, but I expect that for now, any answer will simply be theoretical.
How thick can planetary rings be? I assume it would depend on the amount of material, but I don't know.
