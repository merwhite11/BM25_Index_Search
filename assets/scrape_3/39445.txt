What if the two Black Holes spiraling around each other are evaporating via their Hawking radiation?

A non-technical explanation
In a Gravitational Wave event, the point is that in this event when Black Holes are spiraling around each other, they will cause the very fabric of Space-time to ripple and this event is an energetic event and those ripples travel at the speed of light and  we can describe mathematically that how this could happen and how these Waves of Gravity travel. Now, my question stops here and my question is that as we all know Stephen Hawking came up with a Beautiful explanation that Black Holes aren't so much Black as we thought of, in time, they can evaporate and that would bear the name, ''Hawking Radiation''. Now, this implies to Black Holes, and still we haven't detected Hawking Radiation yet and Hawking didn't had a Quantum Theory of Gravity.
So, if we consider for example, that Black Holes can evaporate, so they must evaporate when they are also spiraling and what will happen in this case? If the spiraling Black Holes can evaporate via Hawking Radiation, how will we detect it and what will the mathematical equations describing this Event be?
