Who gets to name Planet Nine if it is confirmed?

According to Wikipedia, "On 20 January 2016, researchers Konstantin Batygin and Michael E. Brown at Caltech announced calculation-based evidence of a massive ninth planet in the Solar System."
If visual evidence or another researcher confirms the existence of Planet Nine, does the actual discovery warrant naming rights, or would this go to our Caltech friends?
I know from this question's answer, that: 

"Since the beginning of the 20th century the IAU is setting the standards for naming celestial bodies including planets. However, the IAU doesn't set the names, it only sets the standards."

Does the 'discoverer,' or the 'confirmer' get to name (theoretical) Planet Nine?
