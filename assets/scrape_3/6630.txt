Time dilation at the Big Bang

At the time the Big Bang happened the matter had enormous density. According the GR (I may be wrong here) such density dilates time.
If so, could it be that the time periods just after Big Bang which are usually considered happening in small part of a second (such as the Planck epoch), in reaity took billons of year (or may be, infinity) but due to time dilation appear to us as spanning only microscopic parts of a second? Could it be that the age of the universe is dramatically underestimated?
