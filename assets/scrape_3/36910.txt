Could a near collision with small black hole account for the effects of the 9th planet?

Much interest has been raised about the existence of a 9th planet. One reason for this is the strange orbits of bodies in the outer solar system. Could the orbits be explained by a near collision of a passing black hole?
Recent work is looking to see if the 9th planet could be a small black hole. But my question is different. Could a passing black hole, say a million years ago, have thrown the objects in the outer solar system into the strange orbits they exhibit?
