Does the expansion of the universe increase with distance?

I read something in a book the other day which has gotten me really confused. They were talking about the expansion of the universe, and if I understood it all, they said that the expansion of the universe increases with distance. I’m wondering if I understood this correctly, because I was reading about Hubble’s law and it said that the redshift if galaxies far away (caused by the expansion of the universe) is proportional to the distance (up to a few hundred megaparsecs away). Doesn’t this mean that the expansion is the same but the redshift increases? (I don’t see why the redshift would be proportional and a linear graph if the universe expanded from us proportionally to the distance, or at least more further away). I hope you understand what I mean by all this.
