What of the following moon-situations would be better?

Okay, so imagine that there is an Earth-like planet, with the following conditions: 

It's further from it's sun than the Earth is from the Sun (not much, but enough for weather to be a little colder than the Earth). 
It's more or less the same size as the Earth (same proportion of land and water, too). 
Since it's further from it's sun, it takes more time to complete an orbit that the Earth (for instance, 400 Earth-days, instead of 365). 

Given those conditions, I would like to know which of the following would be more stable for this Earth-like planet to have a similar day/night and moon cycle to the Earth: 

A moon that's the same size as the Earth's moon, only closer. 

OR

A moon that's as far away as the Moon is to Earth, only that the moon of this planet is bigger (let's say, twice as big as our moon). 

Sorry if it's kind of complicated. Please tell me if it's not understandable and I'll try to edit it so it's as clearly as possible!
Thanks in advance :)
