Sky Glow calculations

I am leading a project for my High School NASA Club, and am looking for some advice. The goal of our project is to use a Raspberry Pi to control a camera that takes photos of the sky, and uses the photo to calculate sky glow, and create a map of where it in the sky is there the most sky glow. After calculating sky glow the device would add it to a plot that shows how sky glow varies throughout the year, and creates a nightly twitter post rating the night for Astronomy. I currently have working code that when given a picture, it will convert down to greyscale, and then find the brightness map, and find an average sky glow. The part that I am stuck on is in figuring out what kind of camera to use. I don't know if the RPi camera module would work for taking photos of the stars, or if I would be better suited using a USB webcam with it. I am not sure what factors are important in this decision at all. Also, once the camera is set up, what would be the best process for calibrating it to get values that agree most closely with accepted ones? I couldn't decide if this should go on the Astronomy, Raspberry Pi, or Photography Stack Exchange, but I chose this one since sky glow may be something astronomers calculate a lot. Thank you for your help.
