How is the redshift of starlight precisely measured?

When galaxies move away from us (caused by the expanding spacetime) their light seems to show a redshift. But what is really needed for this?
What time lap is for example needed to see a difference in frequency, and how does this precisely work?
Is this also possible for gravitational waves, or are amplitudes the only solution to derive the redshift from?
