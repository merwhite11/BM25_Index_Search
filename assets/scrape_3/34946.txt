Can white dwarfs have accretion discs too?

Neutron stars and black holes can have discs of accreted matter for they have an extremely high gravitational pull. While white dwarfs don't have such high gravity theirs is of course also extremely strong. Can an accretion disc form around a white dwarf too?
