Objects falling in a black hole radiate their mass?

An object reaching the event horizon has almost infinite kinetic energy. When the total energy of the object surpasses the breaking energy of the electroweak field , the Higgs mechanism would stop working for this object and the subatomic particles of the object will get 0 mass.
This means that electrons would no longer form orbitals and what is left from the object will be massless electrons moving randomly and a quark-gluon soup.
I guess because the object will have lost its mass(though energy) , it will radiate some energy away. Could this be an explanation for the Hawking radiation or what's really going on in this case?
