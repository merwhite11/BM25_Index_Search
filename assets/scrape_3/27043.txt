Struggling to use my new telescope

I recently got my first telescope, a Bushnell reflector telescope. I spent a good while setting up my alignment. And I can see the moon perfectly! I went to look at another, Mars. I got it aligned in my finderscope. And i go to focus to see. And i see....basically the mirror in my scope with the lines. Its clearly getting light from the star....but i can't get it to focus on the star at all! Help!!
