I need a bit of advice. I purchased a Orion xt8 and a lens kit with a 2x Barlow 6mm 20 mm eyepieces and every time I try pulling things into focus / magnification or focus goes out the window recently purchased a 5x Barlow to try to get the images bigger. But I’m starting to get a bit discouraged as the only thing I can see in the sky is the moon. All others. Clusters. Andromeda. Mars  I can not pull into focus to save my life. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I see all these pictures of Andromeda from the same telescope and on mine I see dots. (Above picture is the most dots I could see near a cluster. But it’s not the cluster. I guess my question would be. How can I see objects in higher mag / detail. Andromeda is a dot like a star. So are all the planets.
And yes I know what to expect. I know things will look very blurry or out of focus. But only seeing star dots (when they are planets) concerns me.
