Floating Masses in Gas Giants

This may be a very stupid question, as I know little about astrophysics, but if solids like Aerogel can float in gasses like sodium hexafluoride, could there be pressures high enough on gas giants to compress a gas to the point where solid particles such as dust collide and create floating landmasses?
