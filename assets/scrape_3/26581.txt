Are there small voids of 10 - 20 megaparsecs also within, and not only between superclusters?

I sincerely apologize if this question is stupid, however after all the articles I read so far, I could not confirm this assumption, which I think is actually a fact, but I'm not completely confident.
I'm writing on the topic of proportions of the universe, and in one of the statements I claim the following:
"Just one small void inside a supercluster of galaxies can span across 10 to 20 megaparsecs (32 to 65 million light-years ) in diameter."
Let me state that I understand that a void within a galaxy supercluster may not necessarily be completely surrounded by galaxies of that supercluster, and can extend far out from the supercluster it partially occupies, so to clarify what I mean by my question on a practical example:
If you were to draw a straight line across a map of a galaxy supercluster, can that line start inside a group of galaxies of that supercluster, go across a void of 10 - 20 megaparsecs, and end inside another group of galaxies of that same supercluster?
(I am basing my "small" classification of a cosmic void 10 - 20 megaparsecs in diameter on the Wikipedia article "Void (Astronomy)" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy) in which it says:
" ...Voids typically have a diameter of 10 to 100 megaparsecs; particularly large voids, defined by the absence of rich superclusters, are sometimes called supervoids. ..."
My only goal is basically to find out whether I would be wrong or not if I state that small voids of 10 - 20 megaparsecs, really actually exist within, and not only between superclusters.
For any eventual help on this topic, I would be sincerely grateful.
Kind regards
