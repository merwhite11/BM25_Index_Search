Using lightkurve to identify a planet

I have gotten LightKurve to work and plot a lightcurve to allow for the identification of possible transits. However is there a way I can get it to run and tell me if there is a possible transit in the data? I know this possible as at TESS they don't go through all the graphs manually but I don't quite know how to do this? If not is there another package that will do this?
