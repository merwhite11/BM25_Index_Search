What's the object in the sky?

Days before, I saw this pic. I don't know what it is.
Edit: This pic was taken by a Taoist at an ancient ruins in Mongolia on 2012-07-15 04:12 UTC+8 (day break). He said it looked strange.

Edit: I installed Stellarium, changed the time to 2012-07-15 04:12 UTC+8, and faced east. It seems to be the Moon.
