What physical features determine if a planet is a major, minor or dwarf planet?

Like many, when I was growing up, we always were taught, hence always learned that there were 9 planets.  However, recently, decisions were made and all of a sudden there were 8 major planets and a series of dwarf and minor planets.  
What physical features delineate a body being referred to as a major planet as opposed to dwarf planet or minor planet?
