How to compute the sun's (upper) transit

As detailed in https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/41450/is-there-a-simple-accurate-formula-for-calculating-transit-times-from-rise-and, the sunrise, and set times can accurately be used to compute the sun's transit. Yet, in some cases, these do not exist, e.g. in Finland in the summer.
Is there an easier and/or more general way to compute the transit time (and only the transit time) given the UTC and observer position (latitude, longitude, height). 
The library at http://www.jstott.me.uk/jsuntimes gives sunrise and sunset, but not the transit time. find_transit at riset_cir.c in https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem/tree/master/libastro-3.7.7 might do this, but seems too general and complicated.
