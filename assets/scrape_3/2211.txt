How to use a telescope to find a specific celestial body?

I am a beginner interested in astronomy. I bought a Celestron AstroMaster 130EQ telescope. It's a Newtonian Reflector and it's not computerised. I did manage to see the Moon in some magnifications but my real question is this:
Suppose I want to see Proxima Centauri and I know it's coordinates, like Right ascension is 14h 29m 43.0s and Declination is -62Â° 40' 46". Having three analogue dials on my telescope (picture from the front) (zoomed in), how do I adjust my telescope with the help of the dials with the coordinates so I can view them from my telescope? 
If I am wrong that these are the dials I have to use to adjust my telescope to the coordinates then please explain how.
I hope this question will also be useful to other amateur astronomers. Thanks.
