Conventional matter to dark matter ratio, outside of galaxies

Consider say this outstanding diagram from another question,

To begin with galaxies have a typical density D. Intergalactic space has a much lower density d.
As we know: in galaxies (with density D) most of the stuff is dark matter.  Let's say for convenience it is 10:1.
So, the ratio of dark matter in galaxies is (we'll say) 10:1.
But here's what I can not find explained anywhere:
(1) In intergalactic space. First of all simply is there any dark matter?  Or, do we believe that dark matter exists, simply, only in galaxies? Not between?
(2) If there is dark matter between galaxies. Do we know or believe: what is the ratio of dark matter out there?  In fact, is it just the same ratio (say, 10:1) as inside galaxies? Or, is it perhaps even more dominant, or perhaps much less dominant?  What is the ratio out there?
(3) If there is dark matter everywhere. Galaxies exist in filaments and walls.  Does dark matter do this? or is it evenly-spread?
