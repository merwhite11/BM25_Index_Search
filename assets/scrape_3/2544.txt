How would a planetary defence against comets work?

Mappings of practically all potentially dangerous asteroids is well underway. But comets seem almost hopeless to protect against.

How far away are approaching comets detected today? How long time before they would pass Earth orbit?
Is it feasible in our time to map comets in their beyond Neptune orbits, or will we only detect them while approaching?
How much more difficult is it to reach a comet compared to an asteroid? I imagine that the high speed and potentially high inclination of a comet is a challenge for rocketry. Rosetta reaches a comet soon after 10 year trip, but I suppose they picked the easiest to reach comet known.
