Why are Bok globules so cold?

I have recently read a bit a out Bok globules. One thing, that is repeatedly emphasised is that they are among the coldest objects in space, with a temperature of ~3 K.
Why is that so? Naively, I would expect the coldest objects to be far out in the super voids. Also, I would expect these globules to have retained heat from the gravitational collapse. After all, the kinetic energy of their free fall should be dissipated, shouldn't it?
Maybe someone can elaborate.
