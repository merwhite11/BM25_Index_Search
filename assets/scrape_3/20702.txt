Calculating star radius from temperature and absolute magnitude - what am I missing?

In an attempt to visualise nearby stars, I've tried to get the star radius (measured in solar radii) using the equation provided on the following site:
http://cas.sdss.org/dr4/en/proj/advanced/hr/radius1.asp
Now though the equation seems to work fine for a star like Sirius, when I plug in the values for absolute magnitude and temperature for Barnard's star (according to wikipedia, 13.21 and 3134 K respectively) I get a radius of 0.0722. The radius provided by wikipedia is more than twice that value, at 0.196.
There are many potential culprits. Could it be floating point errors in the php code? The equation looks like this by the way:
$$\text{radius = pow(5800/3134, 2)} \times \text{pow(pow(2.512, (4.83 - 13.21)), 0.5})$$
Another possibility is that the equation is too simplistic, and there are other variables I need to take into account.
Any insights would be greatly appreciated!
