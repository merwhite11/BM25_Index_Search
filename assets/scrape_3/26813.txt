How does one measure vector magnetic field of astrophysical object?

Magnetic field strength is measured using Zeeman splitting. This is the one of the way Sun's magnetic field strength is measured. Now, how one measure vector magnetic field?
Vector magnetic field = Magnetic field and it's components.
