Was Guth inflation propelled by what we now call "Dark Energy"?

The more powerful our telescopes become, the more we are able to see earlier and earlier remnants of Guth Inflation. Assuming that it makes sense to associate a location, BB,  in space-time where the Big Bang occurred, then test particles (luminous or otherwise) have been decelerating away from BB ever since. When viewed through our telescopes, i.e.: when viewed in time reversed order, a test particle decelerating away from BB would appear to be accelerating away from us. We usually attribute this acceleration away from us as propelled by “Dark Energy”, and any study to understand Dark Energy is equivalent to a study of what propelled Guth inflation in the first place. 
I am sure that I am not the first to think of such a straight forward interpretation of Dark Energy, but I do not see it in any of the popular literature on Cosmology. This implies that my thinking is probably incorrect. Can somebody point out the flaw?
