How much illumination do the background stars provide?

I'm trying to get a better understanding of what things look like in "outer space." The main problem I'm trying to solve right now, is how much illumination is provided by the background stars. Is it even perceivable? If we were to ignore the light contributions from our sun and local planets, how difficult would it be to see an object (within arm's reach) that was lit only by the remaining ambient light?
Another way this might be thought of is: how dark is the dark side of Pluto? If a person were able to stand on the surface of Pluto, would a moonless/Charonless night be totally pitch black, or would there be enough ambient light to see? How bright might that be?
EDIT: The example about Pluto is a little deceptive because Pluto will block a large portion of starlight. I'm thinking of the starlight that is neither blocked by nor supplemented by any of the bodies in our solar system.
