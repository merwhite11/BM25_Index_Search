Impact of Atmospheric Water vapour on Optical Observations

I would like to ask; how does Water Vapour in the atmosphere interfere with astronomical observations? Is it in the same manner as Carbon dioxide?  
What brought this to mind is the following: A member of Monash University staff claimed recently in a newspaper in Australia that both CO2 and H2O absorbed heat and hence their presence needed to be reduced for astronimical observations. Hence the siting of optical observatories on mountain tops where the absolute amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is reduced by the relatively low temperatures there.
