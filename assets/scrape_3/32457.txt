What would change if Venus rotated at a speed and direction similar to Earth?

I am interested in two aspects of this question. Imagine that Venus had a similar rotation speed and the same direction of rotation that we have here on Earth.
What would change for Venus itself? I'm interested about changes in the core and mantle behaviour, a potential magnetosphere, changes in the atmosphere and tectonic plates.
What would be different for the other planets near the Sun? I'm interested about changes in gravitational resonance and potential orbit changes.
