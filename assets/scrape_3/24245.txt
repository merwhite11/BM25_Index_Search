Does a set moon sky equal a new moon sky?

I am planning some astrophotography. And comparing two times.
On one night I plan a midnight shoot when a waning crescent moon rises at 1am. This is 1 week ahead of the new moon.
The other night would be on a new moon.
Would the darkness of the sky be expected to be any different? I ask because a lot of articles I read about stargazing and astrophotography say the phases of the moon are important, but never mention the setting and rising of the moon as an important factor.
