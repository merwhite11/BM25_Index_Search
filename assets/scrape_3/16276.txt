Could the word "multiple stars" include binary stars?

We are translating some illustrated book for kids about astronomy, and then have a question as in the title.
Referring to Wikipedia etc., It appears that "binary stars" represents the star systems of two stars, whereas "multiple stars" does those of three or more stars.
Thus, our question is whether it is an abuse to use "multiple stars" for binary stars.
Thank you in advance.
