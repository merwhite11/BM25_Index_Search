Smallest mass of star to be a black hole?

It seems to me that I forgot the smallest mass of a star and its angular momentum in order to form a black hole. 
So I know that electron degeneracy pressure is overcome if the core is 1.4 solar masses, and neutron degeneracy pressure is overcome if the core is 3 solar masses, but if the neutron star is spinning fast enough, it can have a maximum mass of about 4 solar masses. But then, this is just the core of the star. How large does this star have to be in order to form a black hole, and how fast would its spin need to be in order to avoid forming a blitzar?
I've looked on google and bing but to no avail.
Help is appreciated!
Thank you!
