Dark Matter Detection

A paper appeared at the arXiv.org (in April or May) claimed that the writers have found the gamma rays emitted by annihilation of dark matter in a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way by examining the Fermi data.  I cannot find this article anymore.  (It is possible that the writers withdrew the article.) Has someone actually detected gamma rays emitted by neutralino (or any other dark matter) annihilation?
