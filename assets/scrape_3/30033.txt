Radiation from Neutron Star impact?

As I understand it, objects falling into an old/inactive/dead/non-pulsar neutron star would be ripped apart, form an accretion disc and eventually emit a burst of radiation as they fall onto the surface of the star.
If this happened to:

a comet
a dwarf planet
an ice giant

...roughly how much energy/radiation would each produce? Also, if possible, over what kind of time frame? I'm only looking for ballpark figures in all cases.
