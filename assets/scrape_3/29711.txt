Is space a thing?

Based on my extent of knowledge relating to astrophysics, I once thought space is a thing, which can be twisted a long side with Time regarding masses of objects(According to relativity theory).
But I found out in this comment session of the following thread (I put the link following to this paragraph), I was pointed out as Space is not a thing, but space is the totality of geometric relations (distance, angle, etc) between things. And my confusion started. 
Do interstellar asteroids decelerate and eventually stop?
How is it possible that the space can be twisted, if the space is not a thing? or is it?
