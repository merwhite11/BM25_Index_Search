How open is China in sharing data from the Chang'e 4 mission?

It's really good to see that man (well, machine) has gone back to the moon again.
Chang'e 4 is studying potential mantle material from the lunar depths and will be conducting radio astronomy in frequencies that simply aren't possible from Earth.
There's a huge amount to be learned that will fill some gaps in our knowledge of the early Moon, Earth, and the Solar system as well as the wider galaxy and beyond.
Will this information be open for the greater scientific community, or will we have to rely on the Chinese scientists to collate and publish the data as and when they can do?
