Is it correct to assume that the relationship between an objects mass and size, is what decides if it’s a black hole or not?

I’m asking this question in reference to a scenario I saw posted a couple of days ago, where it’s stated that if you would shrink earth to the size of a cherry, it would become a black hole.

Is it also correct to assume that changing the size of earth while maintaining the mass, will not affect objects which are further away than the event horizon?
I’m asking this in reference to the same scenario as above. It is also said that changing the size of the earth, so that it becomes a black hole, will have no effect on the orbit of objects around the earth - e.g. the moon.
I’m trying to understand this, with an image of how much the earth will bend spacetime. Both as a earth-sized earth and as a cherry-sized earth.
