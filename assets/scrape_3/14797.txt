Chemical reactions in white dwarf and carbon allotropes

White dwarfs consists mostly of carbon and oxygen. In my opinion, they are too hot to contain these elements in molecular form and hence chemical reactions does not happen (I think resulting CO2 will also decompose under such high temperature and pressure). I have two questions related to that:
1) After a few billion years, can the WD cool down enough to sustain chemical reactions which will result in production of CO2.
2) Given, there is very high pressure and temperature, after a few billion years what will be the dominant allotrope of carbon (Do we have, in future, diamonds in the sky ;)
I strongly doubt given the extreme density of white dwarfs( I think density of white dwarfs wont change over time), if any of the scenario is possible.
