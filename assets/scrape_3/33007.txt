Dark energy and light red shifting

When light is red shifted from distant galaxies, the photons have lost energy. When dark energy pushes objects apart, those objects have gained energy from a larger gravitational potential. Is the amount of energy that dark energy applies to push objects apart equal to the amount of energy lost because light from distant galaxies is red shifted?
