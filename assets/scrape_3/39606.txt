Is there anything like a timelapse showing the Alpha Centauri stars orbiting around each other?

It is my understanding that the angular separation between Alpha Centauri A & B is more than enough for even amateur telescopes to resolve as 2 separate stars. Going by the plot below, over the past 20 years there should be noticeable movement showing them orbiting. Do we have any images/videos that capture this movement?
