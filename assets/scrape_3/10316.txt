Is it possible that some stars are already black holes yet we see light emitted from before becoming a black hole?

For stars we see that are burning fuel at a fast rate, that are very bright, (or any star for that matter sufficiently far away from us) could it be that they are already black holes (the sufficiently large ones) and we are just seeing the light emitted during it's main phase? So, if so, is it safe to say that most of the stars are already dead that we see?
Edit: I appreciate all the answers. This has been a fascinating read. I also hate having to select a "the answer" when I gleaned something from all of them.
