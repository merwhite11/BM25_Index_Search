What is the coolest white dwarf known?

Okay, so in this ArXiv report from 2014, scientists discovered the coolest white dwarf, with a temperature of below 3000 K. However, as this report was from over 6 years ago, I think this information may be outdated. So, as of right now, what is the coolest white dwarf, and where can I find more information about this?
