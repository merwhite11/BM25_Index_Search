Keplerian Elements for the Moon and Earth around their Barycenter

So I'm looking to replicate the inner Solar System to a decent degree of accuracy. So far I've been utilizing the Keplerian Elements and Equations for the planets, as shown here. There is one issue with this though:
For the Earth and Moon, I only get the path of the Barycenter. This is great, but it means that the next thing I need is the Earth's and Moon's Keplerian Elements relative to their Barycenter. Now I can get the starting element values from JPL HORIZONS or the JPL Planetary Satellite Mean Orbital Parameters. However, I get a bit stuck on what the best way to evolve these values over time is. 
I'm thinking that maybe the answer lies in utilizing the Longitude Rate (n) in the JPL Planetary Satellite Mean Orbital Parameters for approximate motion.
Does anyone have any solid resources I could utilize to determine a good solution to this problem (i.e. books/links)?
Also, just so I know, does a question like this actually belong here? Or is it more appropriate for Space Exploration?
