Where does the dust on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko come from?

As we (laymen) are told, comets lose gas and dust when they descent into the denser regions of the solar system. Seemingly so much and so large parts that they can even cause meteor showers like in the case of the Leonids from 55P/Temple-Tuttle. 
Nevertheless we were also told, that the surface of 67P is covered with several centimeres of dust over a much harder surface. Where does the dust come from? The solar wind should have blown away any lose dust long ago, no? Is there a process which regenerates dust on the surface every cycle?
