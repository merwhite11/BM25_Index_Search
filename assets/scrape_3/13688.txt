Quantum Mechanics after the detection of Gravitational Waves

Of course everyone knows by now of the detection of Gravitational waves
But, since General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics don't get along, can we say now that this detection proves that Quantum Mechanics doesn't actually apply and that General Relativity did prevail?
Another question: how can we identify the ripple's origin (let's say whether it's a result of the big bang or another big event)?
EDIT 16-2-2016
I was reading an article today and I thought I'd share it here; It's basically saying that without a third detector we can't triangulate the signal. 
Some scientists tried ways to observe the light of the event directly after the observations of the wave but they couldn't detect the merger simply because it's too far away or too faint to be observed with our current technology.
