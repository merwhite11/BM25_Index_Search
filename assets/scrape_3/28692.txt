Is there a name for this type of orbit of a natural satellite?

Is there a name for the orbit of a natural satellite of a planet who's period is the same as the rotational period of the planet, but the orbital motion has the opposite sense than the planet's rotation?
If there isn't an existing term or name, how would it at least be described, technically?
How much does the tidal effect affect satellites in a retrograde orbit?
