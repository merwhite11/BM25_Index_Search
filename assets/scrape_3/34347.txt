Anecdote of an astronomer looking for correlations in antipodal pairings of stars; what am I remembering?

The question Are the stars distributed in uniform distribution, on the celestial dome, with respect to brightness? brings to mind a different study that I vaguely remember hearing about a while ago, perhaps several decades. This is a summary of how I recall it, it may not be 100% accurate:
An astronomer was stuck in a situation for an extended length of time and in order to keep busy and do science used a small personal computer to do an analysis of star positions, focusing on pairs that were diametrically opposed; at nearly antipodal points, in order to see if there was a deviation from other pairs of points that were not antipodal.
One possible effect that might cause such an anomaly was that the universe was small and closed and light from a star might reach us from both the "short" and "long" part of a great circle drawn on a 4-sphere (or torus?), thereby appearing to us at antipodal points of the celestial sphere, a bit like how amateur radio operators with directional antennas with good rejection ratios can sometimes receive the same signal from both directions along the great circle containing both sites.
Does this sound familliar to anyone? Was it ever published? I've tried googling several ways but lack the proper search terms.
