Has the Penrose process ever been linked to an observed phenomenon in some way?

This answer to What defines the plane of an accretion disk around a black hole? mentions the Penrose process as a potential mechanism that could change the axis of the orbital angular momentum of an accretion disk around a black hole away from the original axis of the infaling matter's source (e.g. a companion star, a galaxy) and towards the the black hole's axis of rotation.
Here I'm just asking if the theoretical Penrose process has ever been linked to an observation, or has been used as part of a potential explanation of an observed phenomenon.
