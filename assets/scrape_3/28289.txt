What would it take to capture a passing asteroid or other celestial body into Earth's orbit?

Every once in a while, we have a celestial body that passes through our solar system. What would be needed to reel one of these in? Not crashing down to Earth, that would be bad, but say into a high earth orbit (above the satellite belt)?
