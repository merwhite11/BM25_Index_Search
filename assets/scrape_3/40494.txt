Why does the outer layer of the sun have differential rotation?

I don't feel that way myself but some might find it really strange and wierd that it has differential rotation and feel that it's a contradiction. They may say "How is it possible?" I am asking on behalf of others who might have that question what assumptions they are making and how to break them.
