Do other planets affect the Earth?

Let say Mercury, Venus, the Moon were all in alignment between the Earth and Sun. They are all closest to each other in respective elliptical orbit.  On the other side of the Sun you have the rest of the planets. 
Would their gravity combine to have any gravitational effects on the Earth?
Or are they all too far away?
