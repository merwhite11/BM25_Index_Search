Old Telescopes versus New

I am having trouble finding the quality of old telescopes. My question is how does a decent modern telescope that cost about a couple hundred USD compare to the top-notch telescopes in the nineteenth century. Can one make the same observations now with such a modern telescope as one could do in the nineteenth century with a top-notch one?
