Why are there so many binary systems?

Most star systems are binary, but why is that? Why would new stars form close to others, and not (relatively) evenly spread? And even if they are clustered close together, why are the majority binary? Or are binaries the ones that survive, and systems with 3 or more stars tend to be unstable and quickly collide?
If that is so, what makes binary systems stable? Why do the stars not simply spiral in and collide, or break away shortly after creation?
