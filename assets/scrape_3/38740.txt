What would happen on earth if there was a surge in gravitational waves

There are claims that when massive objects merge some of their mass is converted to gravitational energy. Such as the following links:

What kind of macro effects, if any, could be perceived by a person with their senses without instruments if sufficiently large gravitational waves happened to hit earth, in the case of a ripple and in the case of a long term constant change (if that's even a thing, otherwise please assume a very very low frequency, which would mean a gentle slope).
What would be an example of the distances and masses involved for us to feel such effect?
