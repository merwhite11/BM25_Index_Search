In which two constellations, were the two gravitational wave events of 2016?

As best as is known, what is the latest thinking on in the issue of,
in which constellation was GW150914, and in which constellation was GW151226?
(That is to say, within the large uncertainty, as best as is known in what direction is the likely center of that uncertainty?)
