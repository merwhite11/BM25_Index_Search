My family saw small dots in the sky moving rapidly at night

My family and I saw small dots moving rapidly from north to south that flew in a V formation (the kind that ducks fly in). There aren't any ducks in my country. This phenomenon appeared twice. They're not stars or satellites. Could they be any type of UFO?
