Is there any possible connection between Gamma Ray Burst and Fast Radio Bursts?

The physical nature of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), a new type of cosmological transients discovered recently, is not known. It has been suggested that FRBs can be produced when a spinning supra-massive neutron star loses centrifugal support and collapses to a black hole. 
Here we suggest that such implosions can happen in supra-massive neutron stars shortly (hundreds to thousands of seconds) after their births, and an observational signature of such implosions may have been observed in the X-ray afterglows of some long and short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). 
Under this picture, a small fraction of FRBs would be physically connected to GRBs. Is there any possible connection between Gamma Ray Bursts and Fast Radio Bursts ??
