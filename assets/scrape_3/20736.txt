Can I make a black hole with one or two atoms?

So I was watching something that said

if we compressed Earth into the size of a peanut: we would get a black hole;
if we compressed Mount Everest into a few nano-meters; we would get a black hole.

Can I make a black hole with one or two atoms? If yes, would it become larger and turn into normal-sized black hole?
