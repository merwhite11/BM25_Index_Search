What is the percent flattening in Haumea?

I've recently noticed that in Wikipedia articles such as Pluto (Link), there's this number that says how much flattened it is (Definition Here). In Pluto, it's >1%.
Haumea, which is a very flattened dwarf planet, actually doesn't have this information on Wikipedia, and I haven't been able to find it online. 
It would be great if someone could find this info (and it's source as well), because I can't seem to find it anywhere. 
Thanks in advance!
