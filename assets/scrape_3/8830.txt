Relocation to Mars

One billion years into the future and the Sun has swollen in size and it is now not possible to live on Earth due to the heat. Mankind has relocated to Mars where the temperature is more favorable now than on Earth. My question is how much time has this gotten us before we can't live on Mars any longer because the Sun is dying ? The next step I guess will be to relocate to another Solar System ?
