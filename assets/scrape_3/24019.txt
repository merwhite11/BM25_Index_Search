Would blocking sunlight on Venus help make it habitable?

Lets say we had the technology to create a mini-Dyson structure, like a shutter style curtain between the Sun and Venus, blocking the sunlight in a controllable manner to cool down it's temperature. 
Could it be the first step to reverse the greenhouse effect and make Venus more "terraformable"? Or at least more explorable like Mars? Would there be any unintended consequences?
Would this be useful on other hot extra-solar earth-like planets?
