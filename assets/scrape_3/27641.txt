What percentage of the celestial sphere can the Moon cover?

I was solving a task that said (paraphrasing):

What percentage of the night sky can the Moon cover during the entire
  year, when observed from all points on Earth (what percentage of the
  night sky can be studied with the occultation method)?


This is a task I read from a book, and the solution states that the Moon covers a "ribbon" of width $\alpha$ where $\alpha = 0.5 ^{\circ} + 2*1^{\circ} + 2*5.3 ^ {\circ} = $ angular diameter of the Moon + 2*the Moon's daily parallax + 2*the inclination of the Moon's orbit to the ecliptic; and length $360 ^{\circ}$.
Why is this like this, I understand the diameter and parallax part, but I couldn't visualize the problem very well. Why is the third number the inclination to the ecliptic and not to the equator?
