Would the dynamic pressure of the Sunâ€™s solar wind be strong enough to trap plasma ions within an open container?

If you were to place a long cylinder, open at one end and closed at the other end, and position this cylinder so that the open end is facing the Sun, and then you were to inject plasma ions, such as oxygen ions, into the cylinder near the closed end, would the solar wind entering the open end of the cylinder be strong enough to keep the oxygen ions pinned against the closed end of the cylinder, effectively trapping them there? How close to the Sun would this cylinder need to be for the solar wind to be strong enough to 'entrap' these oxygen ions?
