Does Pluto's atmosphere collapse?

There were theories that Pluto's atmosphere collapses when it gets too far from the sun.
Then I've read papers that says that it doesn't.
But NASA says that the surface pressure went down recently (implying that it does).
Is there any clear data as to what's going on?
