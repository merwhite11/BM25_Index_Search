Why can we still 'see' the CMB

I read that the CMB were all the photons left free when the universe was cold enough for electrons got bound with protons (recombination) and the photons free in that moment continued traveling in the directions they were.
So I imagine:

the CMB as a sphere (with incredibly thick walls) increasing its radius continuously away from the 'center' of the universe. When the Milky Way formed, hadn't this sphere of photons already passed the space in which the Milky Way formed? How can we still see them if they are moving away from us.
the rate at which the space grew was bigger than the speed of these photons, so the Milky Way and our solar system had time to be formed before being reached by this photons lagged behind the speed in which the space increased.

On the other hand, how can we continuously measure the CMB if is not being generated continuously as a stream of photons like looking at a distant star. We should be able to see them only once when they passed by earth.
