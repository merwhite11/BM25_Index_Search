Why isn't the star that created the black hole a black hole?

If the mass of a black hole is creating so much gravity that light cannot escape, why isn't the mass of the star that created the black hole (before it went supernova) trapping light as well?
By all accounts, that pre-supernova star should have boatloads more mass than the black hole post supernova, right?  Doesn't the star lose most of it's mass when going supernova?
