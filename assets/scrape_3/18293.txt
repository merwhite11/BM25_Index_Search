Terminology: planet plus atmosphere vs planet and atmosphere as separate things

When discussing a rocky planet, is there any terminology to distinguish that you're talking about the whole thing, including the atmosphere, veruses that you're talking about the ocean + crust + mantle + core as a separate thing from the atmosphere?  Or do you have to depend upon context to make that distinction?
