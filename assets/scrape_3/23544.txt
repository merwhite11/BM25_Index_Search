Will I be able to see the Leonid Meteor Shower during mid night?

Most of the articles online say that the peak will be in a couple of days and around 2:00 AM in the night. I am currently living in Dubai, UAE.
When I use Google Sky Maps, it shows both the Leonids Meteor Shower and Leo Constellation below the horizon, when using the search feature. It only comes above the horizon at around 6:00 AM, when it is 45 minutes since sun rise.
So, I am not sure whether it'd be dark enough to see them. What is my best course of action.
EDIT:
This link: https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/meteor-shower/leonids.html shows Leonids will appear at 65° Azimuth and 1.7° altitude. How'd I interpret that?
