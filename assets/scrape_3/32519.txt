Time taken for journey to the moon


India is going to launch a spacecraft to the moon on 16 July which will consist of a lander, an orbiter and a rover. I found an article in today's newspaper regarding   this. If you zoom in a bit, you will be able to see the list of other lunar missions that have taken place over the years. A common difference that I found in lunar missions of 20th century and lunar missions of 21st century was the time. Earlier, the spacecrafts reached moon in a day or two but recent missions take over 2 months. 
With developed technology, it should take even less time, but it's the other way round. Can anyone explain the reason behind this.
