Is the Big Bang inflation caused by Dark Energy

The rate of expansion of the universe after the Big Bang is described as Inflation. It is stated as being initially very fast then slowed. But the expansion is still continuing.  Some say expansion is currently powered by Dark Energy. The equations unlike gravity say that the rate appears to be linearly proportional to distance, like Hooke's Law for springs. Initially the universe was very small, so if the spring constant is dependent on the size of the universe, could this explain the inflation? What experiment could be devised to test this?
