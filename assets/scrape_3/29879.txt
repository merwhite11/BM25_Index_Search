Do astronomers have any idea what percentage of our galaxyâ€™s stars move in retrograde orbits?

I recently noticed that none of the planets in our solar system orbit the Sun in a retrograde direction. This is likely because they formed moving in the same direction as the planetary disk did in respect to the Sun. 
Are there stars that move retrograde to the Milky Way galaxy's rotation? If so, where are they concentrated, and why?
