What are the differences between a Black Hole and a Supermassive Black Hole

From what I understand, the mass of a black hole should be nearly infinite, how much more massive can something get? 

Is the name to be literally interpreted such that a Supermassive Black Hole just has more mass?
Or rather, is a Supermassive Black Hole just a regular Black Hole with nearly infinite mass that is larger in diameter?
If the difference is in fact a change in diameter, how are the changes in size with the retention of the immense mass reflected in the Supermassive Black Hole's gravitational field?
