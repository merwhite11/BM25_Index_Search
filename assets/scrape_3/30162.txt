Help understanding this unsettling image of Titan, Epimetheus, and Saturn's rings?

The NY Times article Saturn’s Rings Are Sculpted by a Crew of Mini-Moons is really interesting and links to the recent paywalled paper in Science Close Cassini flybys of Saturn’s ring moons Pan, Daphnis, Atlas, Pandora, and Epimetheus
But I absolutely can't understand one of the photos in the NY Times article, shown below. Titan seems to be...

behind Saturn's rings, and yet it is
huge relative the spacing of the rings, and yet it
appears to be out of focus while the rings and Epimetheus are in focus.

Can someone help me understand how all of these can be true at the same time?
