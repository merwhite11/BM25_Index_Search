At what distance does Proxima Centauri become visible to the naked eye?

The red dwarf star Proxima Centauri is the closest-known star to the Sun (being about 4.2 ly or 1.3 pc away), however it's not visible to the unaided eye for it is too small and dim. I'd like to know how close one should get to see Proxima well, like most other stars. In Celestia the star would become visible to me at about 0.75 ly away. Is Celestia right?
