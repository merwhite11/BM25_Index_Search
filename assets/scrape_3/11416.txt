Do celestial bodies have many asteroids orbiting them?

Are there statistics on the expected number of asteroids (of various sizes) to orbit planets and moons in our (or other) solar systems?
Do we know of other natural bodies orbiting the Earth (besides the Moon) or asteroids orbiting the Moon?
If not, why not? Though the likelihood of natural captures are low, it is my understanding that there are lots of asteroids (though, of course, all orbits will eventually decay).
