Humans surviving in space

To my (admittedly limited) understanding a human being in outer space wouldn't last very long, mainly due to three factors:

the extreme cold
the intense radiation
and the vacuum of space

So if my understanding is correct, humans would die within seconds (if anyone could put an approximate number on this that would be great!).
What I want to know is that if a human being was exposed to space for half that time, would they suffer lasting and life threatening after effects?
In other words, is there any amount of exposure to space that wouldn't result in your imminent or eventual death?
Would exposure of just a hand kill you, or would you just lose that hand?
Would being exposed to space from inside a room with a single open door help much (I am assuming here the room would shield you from much of the radiation in space), or would the other two factors still kill you off?
Please feel free to correct my assumptions wherever I am wrong.
Many thanks for any help offered to my slightly morbid musings on space.
