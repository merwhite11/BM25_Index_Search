Is their any clue where gravitons come from?

Everything which has mass has gravity. Some theories hypothesis that gravitons are responsible for that, but do they have any clue where they come from? Like gluons are interacting between quarks and photons between eg electrons. But does gravitons have, according to those theories, also have a kind of particle on their own with whom they are interacting with. Or is it possible that fe gravitons are also coming from quarks?
