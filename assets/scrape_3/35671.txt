How do K, F, A and B stars die?

I know that M (red dwarf) main-sequence stars slowly fade to white dwarf stars, and that G (yellow dwarf) main-sequence stars become red giants and then shed their outer layers in a planetary nebula leaving behind a white dwarf, but do K (orange dwarf) main stars take a similar route to red dwarfs? Or do they expand into red giants like yellow dwarfs?
What about F (yellow-white) main-sequence stars? Do they turn into supergiants and go supernova? Or do they take a similar route to yellow dwarfs? And what about A (white) and B (blue-white) main-sequence stars?
