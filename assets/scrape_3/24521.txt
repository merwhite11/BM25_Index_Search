Which moon has a scar as if it was torn in half and put back together?

When I was a kid I had several beautiful encyclopedias. In one of them there was a description of moon orbiting on of the gas giants that had huge ripples all along its surface.
It said in the text that it's plausible to think that the moon was torn apart and then got stuck back together.
Could you remind me which one is it? I would like to read a little more about it.
