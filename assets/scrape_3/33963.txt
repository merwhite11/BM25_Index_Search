What are the minimum element requirements for a star?

What elements would be essential for a star to exist? 
From what I understand our sun is made of mostly hydrogen and helium and most stars have small amounts of heavier elements like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron. 
But could a sun exist on a single element such as Hydrogen? Or on another gas for example oxygen or nitrogen? Or even rare gases such as Neon or Xenon?
Is it even possible for a star to exist without any hydrogen or helium?
