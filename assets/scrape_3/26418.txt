What would the CMB look like somewhere else in the universe?

An answer to a question on Worldbuilding.SE opined that if you were suddenly transported an unknown distance and direction away by magic you could use the Cosmic Microwave Background to determine your position relative to the Earth.
This lead me to wonder, what does the CMB look like at different positions in the universe? Can changes in how the CMB looks be used to determine your position, direction, or velocity relative to Earth?
