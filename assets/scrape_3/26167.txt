How far out can the sun keep celestial objects revolving?

Astronomers define the Solar System as the distance under the influence of gravity from the Sun.
I read that the Oort cloud is probably the farthest object that surrounds the sun. The sphere of this icy cloud is thought to surround the Sun at up to a distance of 50,000 AU, making its total diameter nearly two light years.
How far can the sun's gravity extend to hold celestial bodies around it? The Oort cloud may be the known farthest body but its edge doesn't mark the end of the sun's effective gravitational pull.
