Why aren't new stars in Earth's relative proximity constantly discovered?

Okay, bear with me. In layman's terms:
Ð•stimates vary, but on a clear night, away from big cities and their "light pollution," you'll see about 5000 stars up in the sky, give or take. Even though all of them are in the Milky Way, they're not equidistant from Earth: they revolve around the galactic center at different orbits. Some are in our immediate neighborhood while others hang out as far as 1000 light year away.
5000 stars may not be a great number by astronomical standards, but it's still pretty impressive, wouldn't you say?
Some stars are larger, and others smaller. It stands to reason that some of them might be "hiding" behind others. Because they orbit the galactic center at different speeds, using different orbits, wouldn't it follow that from time to time, over the centuries, decades, or even years (months?) a "new" star would emerge from behind a well-documented one? Shouldn't this be happening often; or are they so sparsely distributed around the galaxy that no "new" stars have appeared out there over the past three thousand years or so?
