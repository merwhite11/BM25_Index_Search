Is Earth's climate significantly different when the one solstice occurs at aphelion rather than the other?

I mean different in some kind of significantlly non-symmetrical way, such as it being much colder during one period rather than the other? Let's assume other factors, such as tilt due to nutation and variation in the Sun, are the same.
