Is there a place where one can see the beginning of the universe?

If the night sky Is dark because we’re seeing the world as it was a long time ago, when there wasn’t much to see, is there a place on the universe where we can see the universe at the  beginning of time? Where we can look at light from the moment of the Big Bang ?
