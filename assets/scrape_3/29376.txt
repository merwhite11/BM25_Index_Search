If Mercury and Venus where to collide would it make a habitable planet?

I have been wondering for a while now about a scenario of where if you combined Venus & Mercury would it be habitable if located in the goldy locks zone? I have found in my little research that Venus doesn't have an internally generated magnetic field. But Mercury does indeed have an internally generated magnetic field. Though weaker than Earths of course. 
I don't really know what other factors for making it to whether or not this new plant would be able to sustain life. 
So my question is, would the new planet be habitable, or are there more factors needed to determine this?
