Is our universe stable or metastable?

I've been reading and thinking about this subject for some time, but I can't seem to find a clear answer.
After reading Q14: 

Aspects of the Higgs boson suggest that our Universe is only
  “marginally stable,” or is perhaps in a transition phase to a more
  stable state that would result in a universe with fundamentally
  different properties.

And this article: 

With the discovery of the Higgs field, one question we can ask is
  whether the Universe as a quantum system it is in a stable, low-energy
  state, or in a metastable higher energy state?

According to the standard model of particle physics, the answer depends upon the masses of the top quark and the Higgs boson. The more massive the Higgs boson, the more likely the Universe is to be stable. The more massive the top quark, the more likely the Universe is to be metastable, or even unstable. From our current measurements of the top and Higgs masses, it seems that our Universe is metastable.
Maybe an answer already been found, but I just didn't find it, or am I not on the right level.
