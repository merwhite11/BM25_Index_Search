Do solar systems have to evolve in a galaxy?

Is it possible for a solar system like ours to exist and evolve apart from all other star systems and galaxies. Sort of like a stand alone solar system or rogue solar system for lack of a better name. Or is there some requirement that a solar system capable of managing and growing planets especially ones that will occur in the habitable zone originate in a galaxy?
