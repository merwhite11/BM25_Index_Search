Whats the time dilation difference between the earths reference and (near) the milky way galaxy central black hole?

How much difference in time is there between our time of reference and very near the black hole at the center of our galaxy.
I was trying to get answer in terms of something like "1 year in here equal to 1 day at near some black hole". 
As the gravity slow down the time, means all the activities are slowed down i.e even nuclear reactions would slow down (when looking from our time of reference). The question can be put like how much slow it is there compared to our time frame ?
