Is the water underneath Europa's ice cap potable?

I read this question on Worldbuilding.SE, and figured that the astronomy site would have answers too, particularly for the specific example of Europa. The idea is that Earth's oceans are salty because rain falls on continents, and while the rain makes its way to the sea it absorbs minerals and salts from the land. That piles up in the oceans, and that's why you can drink river water but not sea water.
Europa has no continents; as far as we know it's an ice cap of a couple tens of km, then roughly 100 km of liquid water, and only then something rocky that might contain salts.
Does that mean that the mentioned liquid water is likely to be pure? Or at least pure compared to the Atlantic Ocean? Or do we not know?
