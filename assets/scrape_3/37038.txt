Catalogs for type K stars and their planetary systems?

I am doing data collection on all type K stars, and their planetary system so I may develop an algorithm for a planetary formation simulation with the Unity game engine.
Where could such a catalog of stars be found?

Is there anywhere I can find some kind of database on all known stars and their properties (mass, surface temperature, radius, and luminosity)?
