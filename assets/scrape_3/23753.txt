Question regarding the path of sun crossing zenith before the summer solstice

I stay in Bangalore, India (12.9716° N, 77.5946° E). For my latitude, the Sun crosses zenith (the highest point in the sky) on 24th of April every Summer, which happens to be about 2 months prior to the June solstice (summer solstice to us here in the Northern Hemisphere).
Shouldn't the Sun be reaching its highest point on the longest day, i.e. on June 21st, instead of April 24th?
Doesn't the Sun take the longest arc across the sky on the day it passes through zenith?
For reference, the angle at which the Sun rises/sets in my location is about 13 degrees, which happens to be almost vertical to the horizon.
