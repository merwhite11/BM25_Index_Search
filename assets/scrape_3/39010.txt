What's the big deal with WD 1856+534 b?

A few days ago (september 2020) a planet candidate was announced orbiting white dwarf WD 1856+534. Some media outlets announce it as the First Possible ‘Survivor’ Planet around a white dwarf, while others even say it is the first planet around a white dwarf. Some add that if further confirmed, (...) shows that some planets could survive the destruction of their sun-like stars. I can't find the source, but I even recall reading an article saying that the host being a stellar remnant was what made this finding relevant.
However:

the first confirmed exoplanets (1992) orbit a stellar remnant (PSR B1257+12),
there are other planet candidates around white dwarfs, and
it is not confirmed that the planet survived the death of its host star (as opposed to being formed or captured later).

Another highlight given is that it is still to be explained how such a planet survives being so close to its star, but do we know the planet is beyond its Roche limit?
I am puzzled: what exactly makes this planet's finding so special/a first? Is it just de degree of certainty about one of the previous assertions? (First around a WD, first survivor.) Is it something else? Or was it just a case of recency bias that made the discovery more visible?
