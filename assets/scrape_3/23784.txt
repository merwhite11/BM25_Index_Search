Is the universe eternal?

I understand that as the universe continues to expand, eventually our supply of hydrogen will be exhausted and then it's "lights out."  Is that really going to happen or is there something "eternal" about the universe?  It matters because if the universe is eternal, and since we are a part of the universe, we too are eternal as well in some sense.
