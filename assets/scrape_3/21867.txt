Counter weight rod

Someone gave me an Orion StarBlast 4.5 EQ, and with it everything but the counterweight shaft. Because of this, the telescope is hard to use. It flops around quite a bit making viewing of objects difficult. Where can I buy just that part? I looked it up and all I could find is an "upgrade" to the rod for $70.
