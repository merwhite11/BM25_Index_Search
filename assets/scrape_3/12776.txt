Two black holes photo interpretation

Please see this image:

I wonder two things about these black holes. The first is, what are the oblong, smaller black hole-looking voids outside the perimeter of the major black holes? Also, why are these black holes not entirely circular, given that their mass is concentrated in a point?  Is this just visual distortion?
