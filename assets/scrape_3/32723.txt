Does nucleosynthesis happen near a black hole or during its formation?

During its lifetime, a star can synthesize elements to iron because of the pressure and temperature. A neutron star is composed of iron nuclei 56 and up to krypton 118.
According to that, a black hole (which concentrates matter to an increasingly tiny space during infall) must also have an unimaginable pressure/temperature during its formation and as additional matter falls into it.
Can it therefore synthesize new elements?
