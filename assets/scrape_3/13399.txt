Observing a point 13.82b ly away, 1b years ago

I understand that we can observe far away galaxies to get an idea how the universe looked like in the past. 
Assuming the universe is 13.82b years old, would it be correct to say that if we looked at a galaxy that was 13.82b ly away, we would see whatever happened just after the big bang? If this is correct, what would we have observed had we looked at the same point 1b years ago? 
Is this an application for special relativity?
