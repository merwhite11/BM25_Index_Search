Of the stars in the Gaia / Hipparchos catalogs, which one is the most isolated?

This is just a matter of curiosity; I was thinking about a scifi story. 
By "Isolated", I mean that if for every star (or binary) we found the distance to its closest neighboring star, then which one would be the furthest from its closest neighbor?
