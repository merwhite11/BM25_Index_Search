What happened before, Big Bang or inflation?

I always thought that the cosmic inflation happened after the big bang (10-36 sec) and lasted for a very tiny fraction of time).
Now, I recently came across a couple of articles (links below) claiming that Big Bang happened after the inflation stopped and when the reheating phase started.
I'm a bit confused as I always imagined the Big Bang as "when everything started", so how can something be happened before that?
