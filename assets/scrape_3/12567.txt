Luminosity of black hole accretion disc

The luminosity of a black hole accretion disc gaining mass at a rate $\mathrm{d}M\over \mathrm{d}t$ can be estimated as
$${1\over 12}{\mathrm{d}M\over \mathrm{d}t}c^2$$
That is a substantial proportion of the rest mass of the in-falling matter. The linked document explains that the factor 1/12 is because at less than 3 times the event horizon radius the matter "spirals in without
radiating more energy" 
What causes matter in the accretion disk not to radiate beyond this limit? It is twice the radius of the photon sphere, is the reason general relativity?
