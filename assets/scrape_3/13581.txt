How to see other celestial things using stars for direction?

I have a simple question. I can see orion constellation clearly in the night sky. I read it somewhere on this website that gemini is on the left-hand side of orion constellation. I was able to spot gemini later that night. I was wondering on how to spot other constellations using orion and gemini constellation.
