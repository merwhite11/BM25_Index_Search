What bright body is next to the Moon in these photos of the ISS transiting the lunar disk?

The question What are the chances that the ISS transits the moon as seen from your house (or headquarters)? links to the SpaceX Instagram-posted photos of the ISS transiting the Moon's disk as seen from SpaceX headquarters.
There's a bright object next to the Moon, but I'm not sure exactly when this happened. Instagram says "last weekend" which would appear to be the last weekend of July in 2018.
What bright object is this, next to the Moon? Planet? Star?
