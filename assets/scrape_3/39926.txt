How thick is the ice on Europa?

The Wikipedia article about Europa states

It is estimated that Europa has an outer layer of water around 100 km (62 mi) thick; a part frozen as its crust, and a part as a liquid ocean underneath the ice.

But it doesn't say how thick the icy crust and how thick the liquid ocean is. How many kilometers thick is the crust of frozen water on Europa? Is it roughly the same thickness all across the moon?
