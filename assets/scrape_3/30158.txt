Measures for the degeneracy from protons?

Come to think of it, the only things we hear about degeneracy is neutron and electron.
I made a generalization:

White Dwarf: Supported by electron degeneracy.
Neutron Star: Supported by neutron degeneracy and nuclear forces, and sometimes centrifugal force.
Quark Star: Most likely supported by quark degeneracy.

Now, we can see that there is no mention of proton degeneracy. 
A quick search lead to the Wikipedia subsection Degenerate matter; Proton degeneracy, and the answer that yes, there is proton degeneracy, but is much less effective than other forms of degenerate matter.
My question: What is the force exerted by degenerate protons, and what equation is it modeled by?
