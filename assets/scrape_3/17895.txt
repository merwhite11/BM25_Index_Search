Can you view the Perseid meteor shower anywhere on Earth?

The peak viewing dates of the 2016 Perseid Meteor Shower is said to be between the dates of August 11 through the early morning hours of August 12.  
Being a resident of the United States, I keep getting my peak viewing dates and times for my area and for the whole of the United States.  There is never any mention of any other parts of the world having the capability to view this meteor shower.
Is the Perseid Meteor Shower visible to all parts of the world?
