How strong does a light source on the Moon have to be to be visible from Earth?

Flashes from some meteoroid impacts on the Moon can be seen with the naked eye. How much light must a future lunar base emit in order to be visible as a dot in the lunar night (like the flag of Tunisia)? I suppose it is a bit complicated and depends on the phase of the Moon, and that the new Moon is so close to the Sun.
