Right Ascension to Zodiac House

At the moment (01-04-2020 09:36) the Moon is situated in Gemini:
"The Moon is currently in the constellation of Gemini. The current Right Ascension is 06h 37m 56s and the Declination is +23° 42' 09”." theskylive.com, 2020.
If there are 12 houses (zodiac) and Right Ascension is in a 24hr format how is the moon calculated to be in Gemini?
The calculation i'm using has it in Cancer. This is obviously a mistake but here's how i'm getting it:

Aries 0h 0m 0s
Taurus 1h 51m 39s
Gemini 3h 51m 16s; <- (Moon is  actually in Gemini)
Cancer 6h 0m 0s; <- (here's where ive got the    moon at 06h 37m 56s)
Leo 8h 8m 44s;
Virgo 10h 8m 21s;
Libra 12h 0m 0s;
Scorpio 13h 51m 39s;
Sagittarius 15h 51m 16s;
Capricorn 18h 0m 0s;
Aquarius 20h 8m 44s;   
Pisces 22h 8m 21s.

How have I misunderstood right ascension and how would I derive Gemini from RA 06h 37m 56s?
