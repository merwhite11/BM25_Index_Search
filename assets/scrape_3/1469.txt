What if the black hole in the center of the galaxy grew faster?

Imagine that hypothetically the black hole in the center of the milky way gradually increased in mass by for example 50% every year. That is exponential increase in mass.
Which visual effects would we see on for example Alpha Centauri, stars more distant and on M31? Red or blueshift? Lensing?
How about linear increase in mass?
Are there software I can use to visualize it as seen from earth?
