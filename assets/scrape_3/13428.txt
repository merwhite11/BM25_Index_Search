Are there any bright non-stellar objects which make up asterisms?

Hopefully the title is very self-explanatory. I was wondering if there were any non-stellar objects, such as bright galaxies, which when looking with the naked eye were mistaken for stars in the time when asterisms were documented and catalogued...
For example, within the Big Dipper I believe it is Mizar which is in fact a binary star system. (Correct me if I am wrong!)  
I was hoping perhaps for distant yet bright Messier objects being mistaken for stars...
