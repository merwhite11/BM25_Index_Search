What is meant by "there is no refraction at the zenith"?

Wikipedia states:

Atmospheric refraction of the light from a star is zero in the zenith

and other sources seem to agree.
I don't see why this should be so. Consider a situation in which air gets warmer from left to right. Then light should curve towards the warm air, and a star at the zenith would appear refracted.

So why do so many sources claim there is no refraction at the zenith? What do they mean by this?
