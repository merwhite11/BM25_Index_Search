What it would look like to observe people with a different time flows?

As I learned, that the bigger gravity source you are influenced by the more slow time ticks for you, the farther away you are from a gravity source the faster times ticks.
So Imagine two different planets where on each people live, one planet is massively big (time ticks slow), the other one very small compared (time ticks faster). How would it look like for bigger planet people to observe smaller planet and for smaller planet people to observe them. Hope it makes some sense.
