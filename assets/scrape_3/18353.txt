absolute speed of bodies as observed by a distant observer

What does a distant observer see if two masses with a given velocity are close enough to each other that time is dilated ?
Scenario (using 2 point masses for simplicities sake):
Mass a: 1,00E+030 kg
Mass b: 2,00E+030
Kinetic energy:
mass a: 1,39037910021726E+046
mass b: 2,78075820043453E+046
this would mean a velocity of
Velocity: 149896229 m/s [ = c/2]
for both masses
distance between masses: 3960 m
using the formula for time dilation  the time would pass at a rate of ~0,5 at mass a and at a rate of ~0,8 at mass b
if both masses are flying parralel in the same direction does the observer see mass a flying with a speed of 
74948115 m/s [= c/4] and mass b flying with a speed of 119916983 m/s [= c/2 *0.8]
