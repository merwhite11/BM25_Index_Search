Why doesn't the IAU consider Quaoar to be a dwarf planet?

Only Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris are listed by the IAU as dwarf planets. Quaoar is bigger than Ceres, yet it doesn't make the cut. In fact, it fits the IAU description of a dwarf planet

The shape of objects with mass above $5 \times 10^{20}$ kg and diameter greater than 800 km would normally be determined by self-gravity

since Quaoar has a mass of $1.4 \times 10^{21} $ kg and a diameter of 1110 km.
Futhermore, light-curve-amplitude analysis shows that Quaoar is indeed a spheroid.
