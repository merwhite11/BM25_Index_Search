What natural mechanisms could lead to the unlikely case of the same rogue asteroid or planet passing through our solar system twice?

I find he following answer to the question What's the soonest Oumuamua could return? unsatisfying and oversimplifying and the last five words "Therefore it will never return." unsupported at a minimum.

Oumuamua as an object is remarkable, because it has a positive net energy, which means it is not bound to the gravitational well of our sun. Therefore it will never return.

So I'd like to ask: *What natural mechanisms could lead to the unlikely case of a rogue asteroid or planet passing through our solar system twice?"

Stick to accepted scientific facts and theories
Let's give an ample time limit of 10 billion years between visits.
For the purposes of this question, the solar system includes the Kuiper belt (50AU) but not the Oort cloud
Don't include intervention by artificial means or intervention (divine or otherwise)
