Where can I find raw text, ascii, or binary data from the GALEX satellite?

I am looking for stars in the GALEX data through the GALEX data using GALEXview and plugging in their Henry Draper Numbers

But the task is tedious by hand. Is there any place that I can look to find the raw text, ascii, or binary data? I want to be able to simply pull the data I need in one go with a program, rather than copying it down by hand. Currently I'm having to look through the data point star by star.
