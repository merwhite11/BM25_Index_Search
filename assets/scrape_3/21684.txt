How long was an early Earth year?

Roughly how long did it use to take for the early Earth 4.5~ billion years ago to complete one revolution around the Sun?
(I know the Earth was spinning much faster, so a day would only take 2-3 hours, so I'd like to have the answer in terms of current Earth days for better understanding - if possible.)
(I Google'd the heck out of this question and couldn't find an answer.)
