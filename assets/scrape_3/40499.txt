When was it first determined that the Sun is a star?

Just looking at the sky, it is not at all obvious that the Sun is a star: stars are fixed on the celestial sphere, they are point-like and not very bright, whereas the sun is a big (compared to a star) sphere that moves through the sky, making plenty of light. To know that they are actually the same kind of object, I guess you would first have to figure out that stars are much further out.
When was it first hypothesized that the Sun and the stars might have the same nature? What was the first element of observational evidence used to backup that idea?
