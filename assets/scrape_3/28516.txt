Why don’t we feel the Earth rotating beneath us?

I’m not sure all of the details in the experiment but basically it went as follows. Someone marked their location of take off in a hot air balloon and went straight up in the air. They stayed suspended for some time before coming straight back down. Apparently the result was that they had not drifted from the original take-off point underneath them. Maybe I got all of that incorrect, but I’m sure it’s close. 
But if in that experiment the Earth had no effect on the landing point, why does the “rotation of the Earth” need to be factored into making the shot with a long range rifle for example? Now I know it isn’t the best comparison and that there are many different factors in both scenarios. Such as “the bullet is traveling and in the experiment the balloon wasn't”, but I’d just like to hear different theories and opinions as to why this is.
P.S. I know a popular answer is going to be that the Earth is too massive for us to feel its spin, but I’m thinking deeper than that!
