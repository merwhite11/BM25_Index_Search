Could we make "tiny black holes"?

To study the physics of black holes (What we presume as really dense matter) could we not simply simulate that here on earth? What if we took 1 hydrogen molecule and just crushed it with enough force that I'd fall apart and then crush it even more? I'm curious what would happen.
