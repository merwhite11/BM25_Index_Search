what is a MIA satellite

I came across this sentence in a magazine:

We sit outside the Lorne Community Hall, Victoria, watching the MIA satellite overhead.

I wonder if the author is talking about an artificial satellite. Can one recognize an artificial satellite with naked eyes?
Thanks for response.
