How could we tell if the Universe is infinite?

I've heard from a number of people that the Universe is infinite, and from my perspective, I can't see how this can actually be known, especially given that the Universe started out a finite size and grows at a finite rate.

Regarding the possible similarity of my question: I want to know how
  it could be and how we would know, rather than if it is. This is
  significantly different.
