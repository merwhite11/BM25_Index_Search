How to calculate the ground track of the Moon's position on the Earth's surface?

I would like to project the Moon's position on to the surface of the Earth, starting with its position expressed as Right Ascension in degrees.
I know that the declination of the Moon corresponds to the terrestrial latitude but how can I "convert" the right ascension of the moon to find my longitude?
I'm not an astronomer, so I'm hoping for a fairly simple answer.
EDIT
My friend used this formula a long time ago:
For the time at which I want to calculate the longitude,
time_hrs = hours + minutes / 60  

then using right ascension of Sun,
delta_x = time_hrs * 15 + right_ascension_sun - 180;

The coordinates of the Moon's ground track at this time are then:
longitude = Right_ascension_moon - delta_x;
latitude  = Declination_of_moon

but i don't know if is correct, or how precise it will be.
