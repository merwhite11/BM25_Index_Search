What is a Barlow lens?

I am looking to buy a Celestron 21023 FirstScope 76 Telescope, which is quite inexpensive, and it has good reviews on Amazon.  One thing that many reviewers have said is that the two lenses that it comes with are of low quality, and the suggestion is to toss them and buy a Barlow lens, and perhaps some other more quality lens.
I don't know what a Barlow lens is.  
Is this a brand name?  The name of a type of lens?  What distinguishes it from a non-Barlow lens?
