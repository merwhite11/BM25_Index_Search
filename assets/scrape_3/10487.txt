Does the Sun's light travel fast enough to have a straight path to Earth?

When we travel through space, we use a curved path following an orbit to reach our destinations.

As far as I'm aware, we could take a more straight line approach but it would require much more deltaV (both in reaching the speed and in slowing down when reaching the target to be captured.)
However the path would still be slightly curved because of the curvature of space and because of orbital tracjectory when leaving Earth.
Does the light escaping the Sun move fast enough to follow a straight line path until it hits Earth, or is it curved in those 8 minutes?
What about to somewhere further like Pluto?
