CoRoT FITS files read error

I downloaded fits file using wget script from https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/datasethelp/ETSS_CoRoT.html
I am not able to view the file. I tried atsromagic and DS9 .  After File->Open I get an error message "..error while reading.." .It happens with both softwares. 
Is anyone able to view these files? If yes, which software did you use?
Another possibility is that using using wget script on windows it got corrupted. Is there a command line tool to check integrity/validity of fits file?
