Converting orbital elements from equatorial reference frame to ecliptic

I have a bunch of orbital elements (inclination, longitude of the ascending node, mean anomaly, argument of periapsis) that are all referenced from an equatorial reference frame. But the program I am trying to use requires the orbital elements in an ecliptic frame. Is there an easy/convenient way to convert between the two frames?
I also have the RA and Dec for the orbit pole, also in the equatorial frame. I am aware of some rotation matrices that allow me to convert between equatorial and ecliptic framesâ€”should I just apply the matrix to the RA and Dec of the orbit pole? Is there a way to turn that into orbital elements?
Or should I turn the equatorial elements into a state vector (Cartesian position and velocity) and then apply the matrix to that, and then convert the ecliptic vector into orbital elements?
What is the easiest way to go about this?
