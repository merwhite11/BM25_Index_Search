Solar system data API?

I'm prototyping a real time solar system / milky way discovery app.
Could you please help me on:
-What is the best orbital data public API I can use?
-What is the standard numerical way to define orbit?
I'm looking for something like JPL Small-Body Database Browser, but for every celestial objcets, and / or missions.
