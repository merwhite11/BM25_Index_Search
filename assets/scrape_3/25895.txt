The question is basically the same:
Can a binary star system have one of the two stars go supernova in the first place, and if so:
The first scenario would be:

Star A of the binary swells to red giant status, and then is either
touching or consumes star B: what would happen?

Scenario 2:

Star A goes supernova, with maybe 1 AU of distance between it and
Star B. 

What info Id like to know:

Can it destroy the other star via supernova? 
What is the effective    range of the supernova, and can it destroy
stars a light year or more    away?
