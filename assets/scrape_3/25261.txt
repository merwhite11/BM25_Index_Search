What spectral feature was used to confirm that S0-2 is "single and available"? What is Brγ?

The Phys.org article Astronomers discover S0-2 star is single and ready for big Einstein test describes the results of a careful analysis of radial velocity measurements of the star S0-2, which orbits the supermassive black hole at the center of our (Milky Way) galaxy with a period of only 16 years. The paper itself (Devin S. Chu et al, 2018) is available for open access at ArXiv, and also ApJ.
The only mention of the word wavelength is in Section 2.2:

The radial velocity of S0-2 is measured from both data sets by fitting a Gaussian to the Brγ absorption line.

What exactly is a Brγ ("Br" + gamma) absorption line?
