Is the age of the universe relative to an observer's location in that universe?

According to Wiki the age of the universe is 13 billion years old, and I was taught that background radiation made the universe uniform in all directions.
Doesn't this define a sphere of space in the universe with Earth at the center? This sphere would have a radius of 13 billion light years.
We (on Earth) could not see anything outside this sphere. As light did not exist more than 13 billion years ago. So for us this defines some kind of edge for the universe.
But what happens when an alien in another galaxy 5 billion light years away from Earth also looks towards the stars. Don't they see a uniform background radiation and measure the same age of the universe?
That alien would also have a sphere of 13 billion years.
So we have two spheres, one for Earth and one for our alien friend.
These two spheres would overlap each other by 5 billion years. Which means, if we look in the opposite direction from that alien's galaxy. We can see an additional 5 billion years further than they can.
If we measure the total width of the two overlapping spheres we get a distance of 18 billion light years.
I now grasp my hair in confusion. Is this possible that two visible spheres could overlap to create a distance longer than the oldest ray of light? And from there I fall into more questions. Can two people measure the same universe age from different spots in the universe.
That's why I think my idea is is wrong, but how could it be wrong and why?
