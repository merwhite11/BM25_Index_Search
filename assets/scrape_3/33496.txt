Can a planet exist with the same mass as the earth, but have a different diameter?

Can there be a planet with the same mass, and a similar composition, as the earth, but with a larger or smaller diameter, and how could that theoretically occur? I've tried to see if there is any research or sites that tackle this idea, but I, understandably, haven't found anything.
