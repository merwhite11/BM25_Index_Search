Why are explosions always used to represent the Big Bang?

In documentaries the Big Bang is often represented as blackness followed by a big explosion with loud noises. This always feels cheap and falling short of explaining the origin of the Universe. Is this really the best way to get green-thumbs thinking about the origin of the Universe? Are there other, better, representations or analogies of the Big Bang? If so, how do they better describe the current cosmological model than the "explosion" analogy?
