What is the meaning tiny bundle of energy smaller than an atom

At the beginning of a video on youtube titled "history of the world in 2 hours", it is said that "every thing begins with this tiny bundle of energy smaller than an atom". I want to know what it means.  atom is matter.  energy is different from matter and is measured in joules where as size is measured in volume units. How can one say energy smaller than an atom?
