Help stabilizing telescope

First time astronomer here...  (pardon any less than accurate terminology)
My son received a secondhand telescope, a Celestron Powerseeker 114AZ.
Last night I calibrated the Starpointer, and was able to see Jupiter and it’s moons as well as Saturn and it’s rings.
However, after I position the laser in the Starpointer guide, the tube slightly sinks into a different rest position. To accommodate this, I ended up having to predict this movement by setting the laser guide a little higher than the target and let it sink into resting position. I also notice that the optical tube has a little bit of vertical wiggle on the azimuth bracket, which makes the altitude adjuster less accurate. The top hinge of the tripod legs seem a little wiggly too.
Is this normal movement or should I find a way to tweak, adjust, and/or tighten the parts of or the entire assembly?
