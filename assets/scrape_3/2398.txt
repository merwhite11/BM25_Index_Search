Is the Moon only 60x60 pixels?

In doing research on vision, I have learned that "20/20" vision corresponds to a visual acuity of being able to resolve details 1 arcminute in size, that most people have around 20/15 vision, and that due to the limits of physiology basically nobody has vision better than 20/10 vision. This is an upper limit of resolving details about 0.5 arcminutes in size.
According to Wikipedia the Moon is around 30 arcminutes wide when seen by the naked eye.
Put these together, and it seems to say that when looking at the moon with the naked eye nobody can see more details than would be visible in a 60×60 image of the Moon

and that the average person can't see any more details than in a 40×40 version

Those seem so small on my monitor. Can that really be all the detail that I can see on the Moon with the naked eye?
