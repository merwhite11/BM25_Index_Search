I've seen some stars tonight. What could I possibly have been looking at with these pictures?

The weather tonight here is great and I decided to shoot some hand-held (too bad I don't have any tripod) night mode pictures shot with P10. I have no experience in stars observation therefore I can't tell what was I looking at. But I'd definitely love to know what are those. Forgive me if the quality of pictures are bad; I've tried my best. At some point I found some of the stars look clear on my phone but fainter over my laptop monitor.

Star labelled 4 is the only brightest among the others. It shines and flickers so bright that visible very well with naked eyes. The rest are barely to be seen if not focus well.
