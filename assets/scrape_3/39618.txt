Forms of stellar orbits around the galactic center

Do all stars in orbit around Sagittarius A have approximately circular orbits or are there stars that orbit the Milky Way center very elliptically, like being in the Milky Way's outer rim at apoapsis and in the core worlds close to Sagittarius A at periapsis? Do we know what orbital eccentricity the Sun (respectively the Sun-Jupiter barycenter) has?
