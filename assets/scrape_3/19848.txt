If the Earth was in Venus's orbit, would it be habitable?

If the Earth as-is were moved to Venus's orbit (and Venus removed), would the Earth remain habitable, would it eventually turn into what Venus currently is, or would it turn into something else?
I'm mainly wondering which characteristics of Venus (hot, no magnetic shielding, etc) are the result of how it is composed compared to it's proximity to the sun.
