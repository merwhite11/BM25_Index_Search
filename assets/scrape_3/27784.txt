Planning observation: determine dates where moon is within 30 degrees of my object?

I'm planning an observation for a proposal and I need to determine which dates the moon is within 30 degrees of an object so I can ask to not be scheduled for those dates.  This object is near the ecliptic so it is guaranteed the moon will pass close by at times.
In the past I've used skycalc to manually figure out such dates, but now I need to figure out dates over a several month period, and I was hoping there was some more automated tool I could use for this purpose.
