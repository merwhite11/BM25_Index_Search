Mathematical Analysis of Blackhole

Mathematically, for black holes old enough that the stellar material has collapsed all the way into
the singularity, the region between the horizon and the singularity is occupied by a spacetime
where the time and space coordinates are reversed from those of the outside world. What this
means in terms of what you experience is unknown. Other more complex conditions can occur of
the black hole is rotating. In that case the singularity becomes a ring around the center of the
black hole. You can pass through the center, but the tidal gravitational field would be lethal in all
likelihood. In nearly all cases there would be gravitational radiation rattling about, and this would
cause distortions in spacetime that would probably lead to spectacular optical distortions.
My question is Black hole absorbs everything. Is there any mathematical proof regarding this?
