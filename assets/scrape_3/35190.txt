Given this report, you can see why people may think the moon landings were fake?

I was reading today that, in research published in The Astrophysical Journal, molecular oxygen has been discovered in the Markarian 231 galaxy, 561 million light-years from Earth. A light-year, which measures distance in space, equals about 6 trillion miles.
And yet we can't photograph the Apollo landing equipment 243,000 miles away.
Why is it that we can better observe this far-away oxygen than stuff nearby on the surface of the Moon?
