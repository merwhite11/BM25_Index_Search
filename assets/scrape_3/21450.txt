In which direction does the Milky Way rotate?

We don't have a photo of our Milky Way the whole, all the pictures are artists' interpretations showing a bulge, a central bar, and several spiral arms. The milky way is spinning. I would like to know: 
a) Does it spin with the arms trailing or leading?
b) I read if the direction of spin clockwise or counterclockwise depends on whether the Milky Way is observed from above or below. I don't understand how the direction of spin (clockwise & counterclockwise) depends on the point of view of the observer.
