How to determine Az-El pointing of a telescope spiral scan?

I am writing a simulation of an automated telescope observation program.  One part of this is to run a spiral scan pattern on and around objects of interest.  I would like to tile this scan pattern so that each image is immediately adjacent to each other (perhaps with a specified level of overlap).  The telescopes I'm simulating are Az-El.
My primary objects of interest are GEO satellites, and that combined with the specific simulation framework used makes Az-El a little more natural to work with than celestial coordinates.
Given the Az-El of the object of interest, I'm trying to determine the Az-El pointing directions for all of the images.  As I understand it, I can define an image location in pixel coordinates relative to the central image centered on the object of interest and then project this into Az-El (or other spherical) coordinates.  I'm not entirely sure how to do this.  I see online and in codes lots of spherical projections (gnomonic, arc, orthographic, for example) but I don't know which one is the right one to use for what I'm trying to do.  Is my understanding of the procedure correct, and which projection should I use?
