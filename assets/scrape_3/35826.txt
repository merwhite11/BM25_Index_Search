Identify moving object in the sky at night?

Last night in the Carribean, I was looking at the sky at about 8PM EST, and I noticed this really tiny object moving pretty fast from left to right, just between the two stars in the photo. It's very difficult to see and after a while it just disappears.
Somebody told me they had seen it a few days ago going the same exact direction and more or less at the same time.
Can anyone identify this moving object?
I'm including the picture of where I saw it, but you can't see the object. I didn't bother taking a picture while it was moving because it's so tiny that I had trouble finding it myself.
Also, is there a way for an amateur like myself to identify these objects?
