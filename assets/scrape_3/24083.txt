Is Oumuamua tumbling?

given that everyone wonders whether there is a chance that there is something to oumuamua that is not natural, what about tumbling (and/or aiming?)?
is there a natural gravitational or other force that would naturally stabilize non-orbiting asteroids in space?
I would guess that there is a chance that we could detect tumbling.
