What would our night sky look like if the solar system was 100 light years from the centre of the Milky Way

When we look at photo's of the centre of the Milky Way, it looks extremely bright due to the concentraion of star systems...
If our solar system was only 100 light years from the centre of the Galaxy, would we still have a dark night sky?
