Does the Abell 1689 supercluster have angular momentum?

The Abell 1689 is a large group of galaxies, containing a lot of elliptical galaxies :

Usually, an elliptical galaxy don't have large angular momentum around its center of mass (spin angular momentum, if you prefer).
My question is about the galactic group, globally as a whole.  Does it have angular momentum around its center of mass, or should it be negligible ?
