Does mass create space?

Imagine two cubes each with the side 1 light year. One of the cubes is empty of any matter. The other cube contains a massive star.

Does the cube which contains the massive star have a larger volume than the empty cube? (Because the mass makes space curvy)
If the star is replaced by a gas cloud of the same mass but which is evenly distributed inside the cube, does the volume of the cube change?
Is it not enough with geometry to calculate volumes? Is knowledge of the mass (and its distribution?) also necessary?
Does mass (concentrations) create new space volume, or does it just change the properties of the space around it?
