How do we know so many details about Big Bang, but we do not know if Universe is finite/infinite?

I understand that this question may be too vague, but I am confused about the following:
On one hand we know a lot of "details" about Big Bang, like really precise details, evolution of universe, age of universe...
On the other hand we do not know size of Universe, or even if it is finite or not.
This seems quite weird to me, since even if we may never interact with Universe that is not observable those parts still interact with parts of our Observable Universe.

Some examples:

Age of universe: 13.787±0.020 billion years (±0.15%) determined several different ways
Hubble constant: roughly 69 to 74 km/s/Mpc (±1.6%) different measurements disagree with each other
Size of universe: unknown
