What is the "shockwave" of a supernova?

A common notion is that supernovae create shock waves in interstellar gas, and can compress them to star forming densities.
How is that shockwave transmitted? Is it by ejected (sublight) particles, or is the radiation strong enough to move several solar masses of gas?
