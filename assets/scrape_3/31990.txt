Can I learn astrophysics and astronomy with my basic math?

I want to learn astrophysics and astronomy, I'm very interested in it because there are many questions that popped up in my head, and really curious about things, but I'm afraid of a little bit on math, but I'm a fast learner, I can understand things quickly and easily especially if it is translated on my native language, I have learned basic trigonometric functions, special angles, trigonometry, algebra, quadratic equations, and some basic math but not calculus, will proceed on that later, and I have learned basic physics, until vertical dimension, but still afraid a little on math and equations, how can I counteract that fear? I mean I really want to learn astrophysics but I'm afraid of numbers,  can you give me tips? And can you suggest me some book? Or can I learn astrophysics without interacting too much with math? Btw, I'm just taking advancement because I'm really curious and interested in astrophysics, I'm still at high school, hope you can help me.
