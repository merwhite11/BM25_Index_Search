Can an SMBH recycle dark matter into energy?

I just had a conceptual question, hopefully it makes for some really interesting answers. 
I was wondering, as most galaxies have an SMBH at their centre (see Kormandy & Richstone 1995; Richstone et al. 1998), could dark matter accrete onto the SMBH over time (perhaps perturbed by a galaxy collision, interaction or merger) and then recycle this matter as energy? Can dark matter help an SMBH grow?
