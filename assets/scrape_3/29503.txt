How do we know if an object is redshifted?

I have some questions about redshift. I think that the first two hang on the last two, but feel free to point out anything you think I should know. 
How do we know if an object is actually redshifted, and that we aren't just seeing the regular spectrum of the star?
How can we tell the extent to which a star is redshifted? 
Do astronomers have a full baseline spectrum that they compare the measured spectrum against? Or do they just use the hydrogen spectrum since all stars are mostly hydrogen?
