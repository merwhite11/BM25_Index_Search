Place on Moon that always lit?

Is there a place on Moon (sure it's near north or south pole) that is always lit by sun? It's to install solar panels if I will choose to make rancho there :)
What diameter of Moon Polar circle?
How high the hill or mast on the pole should be to be always lit?
I used some online calculators and found next:

Axial tilt to ecliptic is 1.5424Â°, Lunar Radius 1738km
Polar circle is 46.8km
Spherical cap height 0.15km

Are my calculations correct? It shows that it should be near 150 meters high. Is any high enough hill exists on a poles? 
P.S. Where I can check good 3d model of Moon with elevation (sure there is no sea level but ideal sphere)?
Thanks
