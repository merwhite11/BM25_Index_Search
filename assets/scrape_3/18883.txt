Recurrence of Moon at Virgo's "feet"

A friend of mine saw a video that claimed the moon appears to be at the feet of the constellation Virgo about once every 17 years with its next occurrence being in September 2017. Is there any reliable sources that back this up? What I mean by a "reliable source" is an organization that speaks with authority on these matters such as NASA. I would prefer that it is available online, however I understand if it is not. If it is, please provide a direct link to it. If it is not online, please quote verbatim what it says about it, preferably in context. Also, here is a picture of what it might mean for the moon to be at the feet of Virgo (do note that the moon might not be to scale):
