Can you identify a star's 'signature' from its spectroscopy?

I overheard a discussion between friends:

If your spaceship was transported to a random location in our galaxy, you could identify nearby stars by their signature, and then triangulate your position. 

Another friend replied. 

The signature of a star isn't sufficiently unique. You can't identify a star by spectroscopy. 

A third friend chimed in

There would be enough unique pulsars to work out your position from. 

I came away not convinced on the stellar spectroscopy question. 
My question is: Can you identify a star's 'signature' from its spectroscopy?
