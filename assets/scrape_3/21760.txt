What is the large astronomical instrument shown in this 1918 eclipse expedition photo?

This nice video musing about (among other things) the US Naval Observatory's $3,500 expedition to Baker City or at least Baker County Oregon to observe the June 18, 1918 solar eclipse, there is a photograph of the expedition showing both normal-sized portable telescopes, and in the background a very long telescope (at least 6 meters, can't see the end) held up by a ladder, with an even longer tent extending backward from the shack sitting at the bottom of the telescope along the ground.
What is this instrument? How does it function optically, and what kind of data does it produce?
