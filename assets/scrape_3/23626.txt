Mechanics of Supernovae

Where does the energy from a supernova come from? 
My understanding is that the iron core collapses into a large ball of neutrons - is that effectively a star-sized nuclear explosion? What is the reaction product called? 
Why does the effect go supercritical, instead of finding some equilibrium rate of burn? I've read discussion that the reaction energy does not appear to be enough to explain the energy seen in a supernova? How big is the gap?
