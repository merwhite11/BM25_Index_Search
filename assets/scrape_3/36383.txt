Can tidally locked planets have liquid oceans on their night side, and would such a planet be habitable?

Let's say we have a tidally locked planet orbiting a star. And let's say that the conditions on its surface are just right for water to exist on its surface. Conventional wisdom says that the water on the day side will be liquid, while the night side will be covered with a sheet of ice.
However, I'm wondering if this is a hard and fast rule. What I want to know is if it is possible for tidally locked worlds to have liquid water persist on its night side, and what conditions could bring this about. And would those conditions still leave the world habitable?
