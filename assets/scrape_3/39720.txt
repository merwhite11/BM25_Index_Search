Mapping illumination to moon phase (font) icon

I use algorithms that give me the moon phase, age and illumination (and more) for a given timestamp and location. I am struggling to map that information to a (font) icon of the Moon Phases font. Each icon is an approximation because it ignores the rotation. Still, I'd like to map illumination (I guess?) to icon as precisely as possible.

As you can see above there are 13 characters/icons per half cycle; 26 characters a-z. However, new/full moon are represented by the numbers 0 and 1. Particularly there's a gap between m and n where the new moon is in reality. The font uses a-z and A-Z to distinguish between northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere (again, I guess).
Mental model
Illumination 100%                              0%                              100%

Moon         full                              new                             full

              |---------------------------------|--------------------------------|

Character     1            a - m                0             n - z              1

Assuming my mental model is correct this means (for the northern hemisphere)

13 characters plus 0/1 to distribute across the 0-100% illumination range
pick 0 if the illumination is <= 100/15 i.e. <= ~6.66%
pick 1 if the illumination is >= 100 - 100/15 i.e. >= 93.33%
if waning (waning gibbous, last quarter, waning crescent)

round(illumination/100 * 15) + 97 to find character index for a-m


if waxing

round(illumination/100 * 15) + 110 to find character index for n-z



Does that sound about correct?
