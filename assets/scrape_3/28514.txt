Why do shooting stars burn close to the ground sometimes?

I saw a shooting star as I was standing on the roof of my home. My home is double storey. And the height of that shooting star that I saw was maybe 10 to 13 meters. It was burned down at that height. My question is why haven't the shooting stars burnt completely when they enter the earth's atmosphere where the air is thick? Why sometimes a small piece gets to come very close to the ground and then burns?
