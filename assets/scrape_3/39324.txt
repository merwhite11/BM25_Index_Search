Will the Sagittarius A* Black Hole eventually swallow the entire Galaxy?

In one of his interviews, Sir Roger Penrose mentioned that when the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies eventually "collide" and merge into one, their super-massive black holes will also eventually merge. He further mentioned that the newly formed super-massive blackhole at the centre of the new galaxy will eventually "hoover out" all matter within the galaxy.
I recall reading that this is generally the case with super-massive black holes at the centers of galaxies: they will eventually "eat out" all matter within their galaxies.
Question: why don't the stars and other objects within the galaxies just keep rotating around these black-holes, like they do now? Why will they eventually be swallowed by the black hole's gravity pull?
