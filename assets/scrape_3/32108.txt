Long tube for eyepiece

I have two short telescopes. The tubes that the eyepieces fit in are different; one is short and one is long, such as the tubes on the Celestron first scope and the Jason Comet chaser. Why is this so and what is the advantages of one over the other? They both take 1.25 eyepieces.
