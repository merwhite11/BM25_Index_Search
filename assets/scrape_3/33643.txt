Is there a way to tell the difference between earth andesite from Mars

I'm curious if there is a way to test if this sample might be Martian andesite.
What type of oxygen isotope (or other) test can be done to address this in some way?
As background, any information about such tests at the University of Utah would also be helpful to know.
