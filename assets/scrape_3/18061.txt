Are there any measurements of other galaxies indicating the existence of exoplanets?

Of course scientists assume there would also be exoplanets in other galaxies besides our own Milkyway. 
Is it true that our telescopes are not good enough to see planets in other galaxies, nor by brightness changes of the stars nor by inclination changes of stars. If so could the total mass of those galaxies be an indication of the presence of exoplanets, or is dark matter a problem for that?
