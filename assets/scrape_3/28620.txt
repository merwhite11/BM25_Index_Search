How could the Moon have arisen from a collision - what would make for an elliptical orbit?

One serious theory advanced for the creation of Earth's moon is that it resulted from a collision. 
However matter would be thrown off in all directions and some will fall back. How could a mass of ejecta as large as the Moon all end up travelling together in a single direction and therefore a single orbit? For a spacecraft to attain orbit requires some form of propulsion. Even if the impacting object 'bounced off' I'm still not clear that it could end up where the Moon is and travelling in the right direction. This would require it to be 238,900 miles away and travelling roughly at right angles to the Earth's gravitational field.

The giant-impact hypothesis, sometimes called the Big Splash, or the
  Theia Impact suggests that the Moon formed out of the debris left over
  from a collision between Earth and an astronomical body the size of
  Mars
