Doesn't the energy conservation law imply, that the universe can't come to a Big Freeze?

.. because, how would all the current matter and energy manifest then? Isn't everything coming to complete stop, minimal temperature, zero interaction state impossible? Wouldn't there still be some rare minor events occuring? And if so, given infinite amount of time couldn't these result in events resulting in some kind of chain-reaction?
