What would the view be list from TRAPPIST-1g, looking back towards TRAPPIST-1?

There's a lot of interest with the recent discovery of seven earth sized planets around TRAPPIST-1. I saw this poster, and the NASA video says that in the system you could see a lot of other planets whipping around in their orbits. 
It got me wondering:

Obviously that poster is exaggerated, but how exaggerated? 
What would you actually see with the naked eye, standing on TRAPPIST-1g, and looking back toward the other planets? 
How big would they appear?
What might TRAPPIST-1 look like?
