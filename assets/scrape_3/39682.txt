From what distances do the atoms in you come from?

If the atoms of a human come from stars, comets, nebulas and magnetrons, then what is the greatest distance that two atoms of a human can possibly have been away from each other previously? Perhaps the distance could be further than 4 million light years, because two galaxies further than Andromeda could have fallen into the Milky Way in the earlier universe? is that correct?
Am I way off? Could it be 5 billion light years?
