Which is the farthest distance a particular distant known- identified object from the asteroid belt can get from the sun?

According to
Space facts

The Asteroid Belt is located in an area of space between the orbits of
  Mars and Jupiter. That places it between 2.2 and 3.2 astronomical
  units (AU) from the Sun

But asteroids from the asteroid Velt like Pallas and Hygiea have an aphelion of
3.4119 AU and 3.5024 AU respectively. So my question is, which is the farthest distance a particular distant known-identified object from the asteroid belt can get from the sun?
Updated since the question might seem unclear. I'm asking for a currently known object from the asteroid belt which gets closer to Jupiter.
