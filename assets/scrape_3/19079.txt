Gravity of other objects in black holes?

If something falls into a black hole, but has not yet hit the singularity in the center, can we (outside of the black hole) feel its gravity? On the one hand, I've learned that there's no distance limit to gravity and that everything in the universe feels the gravity of everything else. On the other hand, we would be able to measure the gravitational field of the thing and thus figure out where in the black hole it is, which contradicts the idea that no information can escape a black hole.
