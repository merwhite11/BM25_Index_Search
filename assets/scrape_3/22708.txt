What contributes the most to the seasonal temperature variation?

The seasonal temperature is ultimately due to the precession of the Earth around the axis. But what I'm curious about is...  is it due more to the side experiencing winter being farther from the sun or is it more due to the fact that the days are shorter and the nights are longer?
