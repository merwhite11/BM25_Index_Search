Communicating with distant planet with life possibility

So, telescopes are like time machines. If we get an image and data for analysis from a planet say 1000 light years away, we are essentially looking 1000 years back in time. Now, if we notice presence of liquid water on it and somehow notice there is life on it, how do we know it still exists. There are so many possibilities.
It existed 1000 years back, then asteroid came and destroyed it. Or, the evolution on that planet was 10K times faster than what we have and life on that planet already existed to a better planet somewhere else.
Even if we send signals, we will have to wait for 2000 years to communicate assuming they send response instantaneously.
So, have the smarter beings on our planet already figured out a solution to this? I am sure they have thought of this problem already.
