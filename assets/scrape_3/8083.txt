What is the cause of the variation from high and low mean obliquity periods of Mars?

It is reasonably well known that Mars has a greater obliquity range than Earth, due to Mars lacking a stabilising influence of a large moon.  However, the Martian obliquity seems to have gone through periods of high and low mean obliquity, as shown in the top chart below:

What is the current accepted theory as to why there are periodic high and low mean obliquities on Mars?
(Please note, I am not asking about orbital eccentricity)
