Difference in stellar abundance numbers

What is the correlation between stellar abundance by mass and by number?
Let’s take the Sun and Helium for example. This paper mentions an abundance by mass for helium as Y=0.275 and by number as A=10.99, which I believe is derived by assuming N(He)/N(H)=8.5%.

How do you get this 8.5%? Is there a standard value for N(H)?
Why are abundances  given both by mass and by number? Is there a historic reason?
Is there a relation between the two, that is can you estimate one “type” by knowing the value of the other?
