Why Free-Free emission is regarded as Thermal emission?

I read that thermal emission/radiation are the ones whose spectra is similar to that of a Black body radiation. Also thermal radiation depends solely on the temperature of the object. How can we consider Free-Free emission and spectral line emission as thermal emission processes? kindly explain
