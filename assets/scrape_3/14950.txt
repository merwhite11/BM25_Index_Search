How to interprete function value of get_sun in astropy

As I know, spring equinox of 2016 is on 2016/3/20 4:30 GMT.
I execute following statements in python:
```
from astropy.time import Time
from astropy.coordinates import get_sun
t=Time('2016-03-20 4:30:00')
s=get_sun(t)
```
I expect to get s.ra.degree and s.dec.degree very close to 0.
But I got s.ra.degree=0.7052336 and s.dec.degree=0.30536325.
Why?  
Hope some one can help me. Thanks.
