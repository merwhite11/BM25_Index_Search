Counter clockwise rotation of storms at Jupiter's north pole. What explanations have been proposed?

On Earth, high pressures and low pressures occur interchangeably. So that where two pressure systems intersect, they move the air in the same direction. But as Juno revealed the first observations of Jupiter's north pole, that doesn't seem to be the case over there. There are eight gigantic storms surrounding a ninth one, and they all move counter clockwise. With two smaller ones in between on one side that do move clockwise.
How can this be explained? How is this possible?
