Is there any significant time dilation on other planets orbiting the sun?

Is there significant time dilation on the other planets orbiting the sun?  Would an 'hour' experienced on earth actually be 59 or 61 minutes on other planets, depending on their distance to the sun?  What about the moons orbiting Jupiter?
