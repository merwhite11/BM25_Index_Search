If dark matter bends light, how do we know the stuff in the sky is where we think it is?

We measure movement, position, and many other things of an object in space because of its light and what we can measure with it. But as far as I know there's supposed to be a HUGE amount of dark matter in space whose mass and size we don't know, and because it has mass it has gravity and it can bend light.
I know physics can take into account the gravity of stars and huge stuff in space, but how can they be certain of any of their measurements (specially the position) if they don't know how that light has deviated from a straight line?
