Exoplanets, Protoplanets, and planetesimals

So, most of the mass of the solar system (that isn't inside the sun) is inside Jupiter. And most of whats left after THAT is inside Saturn. So, all the rocky planets, moons, and asteroids in our solar system are a tiny minority of the mass. 
Now, we're looking at other solar systems for Exoplanets, and mostly finding gas giants. But not every system has one that we can detect- even some of the nearby systems. Which implies that there are plenty of systems without a Gas Giant.
Unless I'm misunderstanding things, the amount of raw material in those systems should be fairly similar to ours. So what, realistically, would those systems have in terms of planets? Without the massive gas giants to suck up all the mass, they'd presumably have lots of smaller objects, right? Massive asteroid belts, large numbers of small planetoids? Are there any models of what those systems are likely to look like?
