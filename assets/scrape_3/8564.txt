the initial astrometry calibration for a telescope

Generally a telescope can memorize how to point to a target with a particular RA&Dec. There is no need to calibrate every day.
How can it happen?
How to let the telescope(non-amateur) know the position of a star after it was built? For an amateur telescope, how to realize it? There should be a zero point? 
How often should the calibration be?
