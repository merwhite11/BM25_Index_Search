rotation curve in the innermost part of galaxies

I read in Sofue's articles (1999) that he used a method to investigate the bulge of galaxies to obtain rotation curve of this part of galaxies. So my question is how could Vera Rubin et al. obtained the rotation curve in their article (1978), especially the steep increase in the begenning of the curve since in Sofue's article he seems to say it was rather difficult, at that time, to investigate galactic bulges ?
