Is it true that open clusters have $E > 0$ and globular clusters have $E < 0$?

I just need to confirm or refute something I'm believing since a very long time, maybe without real evidence.
Can we distinguish stellar clusters by their total mechanical energy ?
Is it true that all "open" star clusters have a positive energy (i.e. more kinetic energy that potential energy), while all globular clusters are "closed" systems with negative total energy (i.e less kinetic energy than total potential energy) ?
So for example, the Peiades M45 are "open" : they have $E > 0$, while M4, M53 and M80 (globulars) have $E < 0$ ?  Is this true ?
