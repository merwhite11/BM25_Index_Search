How to get error out of astropy constants

How do I get the error value out of an astropy.constants quantity?
In [87]: from astropy import constants as c

In [88]: c.M_sun
Out[88]: <Constant name='Solar mass' value=1.9891e+30 error=5e+25 units='kg' reference="Allen's Astrophysical Quantities 4th Ed.">

In [89]: c.M_sun.value
Out[89]: 1.9891e+30

In [90]: c.M_sun.error
AttributeError: 'Constant' object has no 'error' member
