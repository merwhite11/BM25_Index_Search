Convert a Decimal into RA or Dec

http://exoplanets.eu/ displays R.A. on screen in hh:mm:ss format but when you export the table, it gives the R.A. as a decimal.  Likewise for Declination.  
How can I turn for example 24.35417 (WASP-18) into 01:37:25.0 ?  And likewise for Declination -45.67778 to -45:40:40?  I'm looking for a method, not a website that will do it for me.
Either a way to convert between formats or how do I export in non-decimal format?
Thanks
