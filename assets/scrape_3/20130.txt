How close can planets form to one another?

With the NASA announcement today regarding the discovery of a system containing seven earth-sized planets (3 within the habitable zone), I wondered about the seemingly crowded conditions.  What principles guide the formation of planets and the distances between them?  Are there laws governing this that are well established?  How close have we observed two planets form?
