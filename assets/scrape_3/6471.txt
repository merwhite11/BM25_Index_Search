What is the shape and size of a gamma ray burst?

As I understand it, a gamma ray burst is created when a massive star collapses into a black hole.  The poles of the black hole eject a massive burst of energy which we know as gamma ray bursts.
So my question... Are gamma ray burst more or less cylindrical in shape?  Somewhat like a quasar, but in a spectrum that is invisible to our visible spectrum?  And if so, what would the diameter of it be?
