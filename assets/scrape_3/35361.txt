Is science data from astronomical telescopes analyzed with something analogous to "optical character recognition"?

Do people manually input the science data from telescopes into databases or does some software automatically collect the data from telescopes and put it in servers and databases?
I'd imagine there's too much data from present-day telescopes that they can collect to handwrite or hand by hand input the data from them into spreadsheets therefore computers do it via machine learning?
