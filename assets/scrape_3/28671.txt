Deep space radiation distribution

What frequency distribution law applies to a random point in deep space that is assumed to be far away from any particular source of radiation. 
Can it be expressed by some form of Plancks/Bose-Einsteins/Fermi-Diracs laws or a mix of all of them? 
What would be the mean frequency/wawelength?
Would the mysterious "dark energy" be a major contributor to the distribution?
