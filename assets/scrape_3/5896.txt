is there any theory or observational evidence that our universe is electrically neutral or not?

It seems our universe is neutral in large scale.
There is CP violation (wiki) problem with respect to matter and antimatter. 
Similarly is there any theory about whether our universe is electrically neutral?
Cosmic rays are not neutral. However the atomic nucleus and electrons are just separated. There should be no charge excess in total.
What is the largest scale that is severely non-neutral?
