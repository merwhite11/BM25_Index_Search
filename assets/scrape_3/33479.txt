Minimum telescope needed to see the rings of the Saturn

I am a total novice. My daughter, likes Saturn.  Since Saturn is so close I thought it was a good time to view it with her.
What are the minimum needed telescope specs?
Update: Can answer answers be put in terms of magnification? Or the specs?
