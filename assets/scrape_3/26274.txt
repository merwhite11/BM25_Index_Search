What makes an exoplanet to orbit around its star backwards?And why did we consider our orbital movement to be forward?

I read somewhere that an exoplanet in the name of HAT-P-7B orbits its star backwards.Why?

And why did we consider our orbital movement to be forward?Is there some scientific reason to consider the movement as forward?
