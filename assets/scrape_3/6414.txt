During an eclipse, does the size of the moon and sun match perfectly?

During a lunar or solar eclipse, from our perspective when we look towards the moon and the sun is behind the moon, does it fit exactly?   
Has anyone calculated the sizes of each in a relative context?  Obviously the sun is thousands of times larger, but I am talking about the size of the sun/moon when looking from our perspective.
I hope my question makes sense.
