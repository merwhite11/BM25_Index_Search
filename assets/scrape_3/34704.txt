Saint-Exupery describes visit to plateau where he easily finds several meteorites. Is this realistic?

In "Wind, Sand and Stars" Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry describes a visit to a plateau where it is extremely easy to discern meteorites from stones, since there are no stones.

I picked up one and then a second and then a third of these stones, finding them at about the rate of one stone to the acre. And here is where my adventure became magical, for in a striking foreshortening of time that embraced thousands of years, I had become the witness of this miserly rain from the stars. the marvel of marvels was that there on the rounded back of the planet, between this magnetic sheet and those stars, a human consciousness was present in which as in a mirror that rain could be reflected.

Is this realistic? Are there places on Earth where you can find meteorite on 5 minute walk?
edit: Judging by this NASA article looking for meteorites in Antarctica is relatively hard.
