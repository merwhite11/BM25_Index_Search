What would an asteroid inside of Mercury's orbit be called?

The first Vatira asteroid has been discovered. This makes me wonder if there is already a name for the hypothetical class of asteroids that orbit entirely inside of Mercury's orbit. It wouldn't be the first time that an astronomical class is named before being actually observed.
Is there a name to designate the hypothetical subclass of Atira asteroids whose aphelion is closer to the Sun than Mercury's perihelion ?
