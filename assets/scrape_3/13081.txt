What is the temperature inside a Black Hole?


Is it insanely hot? Cause of so much gravity?
Is it close to absolute zero? Cause the matter is so closely packed, there is hardly any space for particles to move?
Is it room temperature? Cause Cooper didn't die in Interstellar when he went into a Black Hole?
