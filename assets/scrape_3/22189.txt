How much does cloud cover affect viewing the total eclipse

As I look for a spot for viewing the total eclipse, how much will cloud cover affect the viewing experience? Is there a threshold list like:
Under x % won't have a noticeable difference
Over x % you won't be able to see the stars
Over x % you won't be able to see the sun's atmosphere
Over x % you will only notice the darkening
