Spacetime curvature illustration accuracy

When a particle travels through spacetime, this is sometimes illustrated moving in flat grid with various depths. How accurate is this way of imagining gravity?
Can the gravity well be infinitely deep?

Looking at this illustration, it suggests that there is an amount of distance going down the well. Is movement down the well limited by the speed of light? Remember, I'm aware that it is an illustration, and the question is about the accuracy of the illustration.
Is all gravitational wells infinitely deep at the exact center? So that if a particle could be made small enough to fit within the center, it would become a black hole.
