What type of energy is escaping from black-hole's poles?

Following this article, it is stated that: 

As a star drifts too close to a supermassive black hole, intense tidal
  stresses rip the star to shreds. As this happens, the shredded
  material will be dragged into the black hole’s accretion disk — a hot
  disk of gas that is gradually pulled into the black hole’s event
  horizon, bulking up the black hole’s mass or blasted as energetic
  jets from its poles.

Questions are, 

What is the energy type that escapes from the poles? 
What is the magnitude of the power? 
Can this energy be potentially harnessed? 
How far into space do these energy jets blow?

Also, if you feel like discussing this: if mass m goes into the black hole and comes out as energy E from the poles, assuming the speed of light c has no play in this transaction of going in or out, what happened to $c^2$ from ? Could a black hole be hypothetically faster than light? Or maybe the reverse direction of light? (I even got confused from this thought...)
So, if those jets are not pure energy, but are energized matter, 

What type/kind of matter it would be? (gas? solid? liquid?)
Is all the matter that comes in, also goes out? I am thinking if the black hole works like a car's engine - does it have conversion efficiency? 
Can this matter be cultivated, harnessed, or converted back to what it was or something new all together?

This question is presented here after it was asked on the space stackexchange. I want to leave it there because it has some relevant discussion to this question overall.
