Does gravity repel when dark energy is involved?

So I am currently reading the book We have no idea by Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson.
In one of their chapters they talk about how gravity is a force that only attracts and doesn't repel, most of the time. Dark energy is what makes up 68% of the universe and the only way we know it exists is from its rapid expansion.
The expansion isn't slowing down, however, it is speeding up. Gravity is a force that is said to be a force that only attracts and doesn't repel, unlike electromagnetism, the weak force and the strong force. Gravity should be slowing down that expansion, and I am wondering if anyone can explain this or is this concept out of our reach.
