About more than 15 stars moving in straight line through the sky

I had seen more than 15 stars are moved in a straight line through the sky just like a train. And the distance between each star was not same, some of them were near and some of them were far. The intensity of the light of each star was also different. I had seen this phenomena on 21st November 2019 at Indian time 5:30 AM in my place. What could that have been?
