Mars night sky -- Phobos and Deimos?

I'm having a debate about how bright Martian nights would be, in terms of both the sky itself and ground illumination. This answer seems to indicate that the stars would be only dimly visible, and wouldn't provide enough light to see by. However, the question remains of how much illumination the moons would provide. I've seen it said that Deimos would appear about as bright as Venus does from Earth, and that Phobos would be about twenty times brighter, but it's not clear to me how that compares to e.g. our own moon's illumination. So how bright would it look? Would it be enough to see by?
