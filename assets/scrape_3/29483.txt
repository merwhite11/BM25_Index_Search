Did I see a mentionable event in Germany early morning on 6th of February 2019?

Around 6.15am (GMT + 1) on the 6th of February 2019 I 
was looking out of my window somewhat north, when I saw something one would probably call a shooting star. The features were:

A magnitude I haven't seen before; it even had a soft blinding effect, that's how bright it was.
From my view frame it moved from my right to my left (so most likely from east to west). 
The size was a quarter to half of what the moon usually has from my view frame.
It traveled almost through the sky half I was able to see within half a second before its glow was immediately gone again. 

I am assuming the object must have been either very large and fast or quite close.
Was there any meteor worthy mentioning passing by Earth at that given time?
Or are the features I just described way more common than I am assuming, and I just spotted an event that happens quite regularly?
