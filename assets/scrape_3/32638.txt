What will be the end of the universe?

I am looking at this video about the timeline of the future.
It says that the universe will stop expanding in about 1 googol years and become a cold bubble but I am not sure that will be true. There are several theories that can be true, so I am not sure which one. Anyone have some proof that one will be true? Thanks!
