What does it mean for space to expand?

In this YT video Michelle Thaller says The Big Bang wasnâ€™t an explosion but an expansion and as such there's no empty center where the explosion would've been.
To explain expansion she uses the analogies of surface of a balloon being blown up and stretching a rubber sheet.
But isn't it true that any shape, be it having an edge (the sheet) or a balloon/sphere, would have a point that isn't expanding? ... the center of an expanding 2D rectangle, a sphere or cube, etc?
Is it more accurate to say that it's not like a sheet or balloon but that either every point in space is expanding three dimensionally, or, that space is actually not expanding, because it doesn't exist, and that what we call 'space expanding' is actually cosmic entities traveling in uncoordinated directions?
