Black hole's gravity

Is gravity relative to volume, or size of an object? 
Since a black hole is a massive star that collapses on its weight, how comes the same sun's mass, when it becomes a black hole, provides gravity that disallows even light to come out of the black hole? Before it was a black hole, the sun had a similar weight to the black hole, since no mass was lost or gained (and particles, including photons, come out of the star). Once it collapses under its weight, does the gravity become more in relation to the size of the object in question (reduction from the huge surface area of a massive star, to a compact/compressed, low surface area black hole), now that the same non-increased or subtracted gravity is bound to a much smaller surface? 
Or in other words, what is it that makes everything bound to a black hole, but nothing of the same happens to a sun of similar mass, (and therefore with the same gravitational pull).
