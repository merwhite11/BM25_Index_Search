Hole through the earth

I have a problem: If I would dig a hole through the earth, and jump right in, disregarding the rotation of the earth, I should come back out on the other side.
However, orbital mechanics say otherwise: Specific Orbital Energy tells me:
v^2/2 - µ/r = -µ/2a

Now, on the planet, my relative velocity is 0 m/s, so v^2/2 = 0. The term simplifies to:
-µ/r = -µ/2a | / (-µ)
1/r = 1/2a | ^(-1)
r = 2a | /2
a = r/2

My apoapsis is 3000 km by this equation. But it should be 6000 km, since I come out of the other side.
Why is this, and did I do a wrong assumption?
