mirror image of the earth in the past

For example, if there was an object somewhere in the room, say 100 light years away, which would have to be very large and have the surface of a mirror, you could theoretically point the telescope at it and you would see the earth as it is was back then. Of course you would have to do all the details for years, the telescope would have to be much stronger and bigger, and something like this would have to exist and be discovered, but theoretically it could work that way. Your opinions would interest me very much!
Thank you
