How does time work beyond the cosmic event horizon?

The faster you move through space, the slower you move through time - the calculations show that as you approach lightspeed, time comes to a standstill. 
How does time work beyond the cosmic event horizon? Space is stretched in every direction, meaning the further away something is, the faster it moves away from us.
But what about when that speed is more than $3 \cdot 10^8 \frac{m}{s}$ due to the distance away from us it is? What happens then?
