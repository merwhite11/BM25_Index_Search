Book recommendation

I'm looking for a modern astrophysics text. I've had Barbara Ryden's book Foundations of Astrophysics recommended to me and it sounds okay, but the only review of it I've seen slagged off the problem sets as "more complex than they would initially seem, and often don't actually derive from the chapter."
Any other opinions on this or recommendations for other texts?
I have an okay grasp of calculus and I'm currently teaching myself introductory mechanics, so I'm not a complete novice (close, but not quite). I'm definitely looking for a college text, not popsci. I'm looking for an introductory astronomy text that assumes 2 semesters of calculus and 2 semesters of introductory physics - basic mechanics and basic electricity and magnetism, essentially. So nothing too high-powered, but also not too watered down.
