MeerKAT's Epic Image of the Galactic Centre, what are we seeing?

In this answer as well as this one, I've linked to New Jersey Institute of Technology's Dr. Dale Gary's nicely-written Physics 728 Radio Astronomy; Lecture #1 notes where I can see the image below. It links to Gizmodo.au's New South African Telescope Releases Epic Image Of The Galactic Centre.
I have heard of the Meerkat array earlier (Which 16 antenna locations are used for the MeerKAT radio image recently announced?), but I am wondering how to read further about this spectacular image. What is the scale for example? How would it look pasted into the arc of the Milky Way; just a tiny patch of a few arc-minutes, or several tens of degrees?
How will this compare to the radio image of Sag A* that we will see in the next day or two?
Also, if anyone knows, what are those spiky arcs sticking up, and those puff-ball things on the left?
