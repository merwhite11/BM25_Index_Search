Has the effect of other planets on Earth's orbit been ever measured?

Since other planets have their own gravitational pull, I'm wondering if their effect on Earth's orbit has ever been measured? I know that in comparison with the Sun's pull the effect might be rather small, but I'm wondering if it's measurable...
