time on earth compared to completely stationary in space

I recently started trying to understand the theory of relativity and I have the following question.  Because earth is orbiting the sun at approx 67,000 mph (and its my understanding time slows down the faster you are moving) what are the effect of time on earth compared to a completely stationary observer watching earth's orbit, from outer space?  How would the twin paradox work with one twin on earth and the other twin completely stationary in outer space?
