Am I seeing the constellation Orion?

I am on the west coast of the U.S. and for several weeks I have seen two large, twinkling objects in the eastern sky at night with the naked eye. In between them there are 3 smaller ones that are stacked vertically and very close to one another. All 5 rise in the sky as a group as the evening progresses. Could this be Orion? Thank you.
