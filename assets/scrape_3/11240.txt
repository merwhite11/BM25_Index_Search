How significant and accessible is modern Chinese astronomy?

Is China fully integrated in the international astronomical community, or does military secrecy and language problems and sanctions (ITAR) or something else stand in the way? Does China have valuable assets for astronomical observations, and a vibrant national astronomical academical community?
China has an ambitious and successful HSF and Lunar program with orbiters and a lander. They have also announced a very ambitious program for inter-planetary probes to practically the entire Solar system, to date they've flewn by the NEO Toutatis. The are also building a 500 meter radio telescope super-version of Arecibo.
Will for example US astronomers be able to use that telescope? Will they be offered samples of the upcoming Chinese lunar sample return, maybe from the lunar far side? Have lunar ground penetrating radar data from Chang'e 3 been presented publicly and led to papers in international journals? Is there any prominent Chinese astronomical journal?
