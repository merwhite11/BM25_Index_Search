Is the SOI a spherical region or a oblate-spheroid-shaped region?

The Wikipedia article on Sphere of influence states that:

"A sphere of influence (SOI) in astrodynamics and astronomy is the
  oblate-spheroid-shaped region around a celestial body where the
  primary gravitational influence on an orbiting object is that body."
  (Emphasis added.)

It then gives an expression for the radius of the sphere of influence. 
Is the SOI a spherical region or a oblate-spheroid-shaped region? 
If it is an oblate-spheroid-shaped region, then why?
