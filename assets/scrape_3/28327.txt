If a giant object would approach the Earth, would Earth start to turn faster or slower while the object starts to become nearer and nearer?

I am asking myself this question: if a giant celestial object would approach the Earth, would Earth start to turn faster (then day duration would be diminished) or slower (day duration increased) while the object starts to become nearer and nearer?
Thank you!
