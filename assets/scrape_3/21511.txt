Is this image captured by the Hubble Telescope an original image?


Is this image an original picture which is not photoshoped? I see a huge number of Hubble Telescope images on Google and I'm curious whether they are real images or not. If not, where I can find the real images captured by the Telescope which are not photoshopped?
