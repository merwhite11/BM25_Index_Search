Can the Milky Way be seen with the naked eye? Does this apply to any galaxy? If yes, then how and when?

I have seen different pictures in a different community to showcasing the Milky Way. I can never tell whether it's edited or it's the real picture. Actually, I can never see any galaxy as such by with my naked eye. But can the Milky Way be seen with the naked eye? If yes, then I would really like to know when and how this is possible.
