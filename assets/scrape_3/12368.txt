Was that actually a shooting star during the supermoon eclipse on September 27th 2015?

During the super-moon total lunar eclipse on September 27th a meteor-like streak passed very close within view of the event. It appeared to happen at the very middle, the maximum eclipse.

At the time, I thought it must have been some organization shedding an unused satellite. This would be a pretty epic time to do so as so many eyes around the world are looking at the same thing. Maybe even NASA marking the halftime of the event. Can anyone confirm or shed any amount of light on what this was?

note - photo for proof only - shutter cut off leading edge
QUESTIONS:
People on the Caffery's Facebook page seem to have seen in in California and other locations as well, I happened to be in St Thomas, Virgin Island at the time of the event.  CafferyPhoto quotes. "I was only exposing for half a second so the shutter cut off the latter half of the trail, darn it!" - Seems in was taken in the NorthWestern US sometime around 7:30pm.
