Objection on artificial moon for lighting

Some days ago i read about China's artificial moon mission for lighting cities 
In my junior classes i was taught the effect of Moon's gravity on tidal waves.
According to me this is a very dangerous mission this can cause floods due to additional gravitational force.
Am I wrong?Please explain.

I had searched on Internet about this defect of China's artificial moon for lighting but i didn't found any result.Many astronomers are against this mission as this will disturb natural timing of flora and fauna.But no one has raised the point ,that it will disturb natural motion of tidal waves.
