What type of planetary-mass object would Planet Nine be?

Given that Planet Nine is hypothesized to be 10-20 times the mass of the Earth orbiting the sun some 200-2500 AU out, what kind of planetary-mass object would it be?
Even given that it has apparently "influenced" several Trans-Neptunian objects, since its orbit is so large and so slow (approximately 25,000 years) it would take an awful long time to clear out its own orbit (especially given that we do not know how long it has been in that orbit), so it seems like it would not qualify as an actual planet under the rules that re-classified Pluto.
Since it orbits our sun, it wouldn't be an exoplanet nor a rogue planet.  And it sure seems too big to be called a dwarf planet.
A captured planet seems closest in other attributes, but it probably was not either a capture nor a re-capture, but more likely a partial ejection.
So what classification would it fall into?
