Superluminous super nova output

I was reading about how powerful supernova were and found out there are even bigger supernovae also called hyper nova.  A large explosion was discovered in 2016 I believe (or was it 2017).   I would like to know on a human scale how much power that is.  Suppose an inventor produced an engine technology that has the output of the largest superluminous super nova to project a space shuttle.  How fast would the space ship be projected forward?  That is the output pushes air to project the space ship forward.  What speed would it reach.  Part of me wants to say faster than light.  I imagine the ship will travel so fast it would disintegrate since matter cannot exceed the speed of light.
