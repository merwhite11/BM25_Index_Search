Which spacecraft would be moving faster?

If identical spacecraft were orbiting Mars and Earth at identical radii (distances), which spacecraft would be moving faster? Why?
My reasoning is based on equation: a3 = P2 * (M1 + M2). Earth's mass is larger that that of Mars (we can ignore the mass of the spacecraft since it is negligible in comparison that of the planets), and the problem states that a is also the same in both cases. Therefore, for a spacecraft orbiting Earth P (orbital period) should be less than the one orbiting Mars. It implies that it should move faster. 
Am I reasoning correctly? Please consider that it is a question from a introductory textbook chapter which is about laws of planetary motions, Newton's law of gravitations, orbits in Solar system etc. So answer should be adequate to this level.
