What causes the duration of moon phases (the time the moon is visible above the horizon) to vary for an observer in the northern hemisphere?

Why does each phase of the moon stay up a different number of hours per phase, so that, for example, Januaryâ€™s full moon was up twice as long as the new moon? Plus every month this bulge shifts and at some point the opposite phase is doubled. Three June full moon nights takes six March 1st quarter nights. Why does this happen?
