How to generate times of sunset along a line that crosses a continent?

Would like to avoid using single location iteration of a website that gives time of sunset each date for locations.
I want to be able to produce a chart or info-graphic for publishing on a website as a guide for participants stretching from nyc,through Lebanon KS,to San Francisco.
A great circle path with formula or algorithm to produce the table or graph???
interval of time would be June to November only
