Would we have more than 8 minutes of light, if the Sun "went out"?

The common theory is, that if the Sun "shut down", we would see the light for eight more minutes (the time that it takes the photons to reach the Earth).
However recently I have read that photons need around 100,000 years to reach the Earth, since the reactions are happening at the Sun's core and gamma rays can't leave the Sun without interacting with other particles, unlike neutrinos for example.
Is that theory correct? If the Sun's core "shut down", would we still receive photons (light) for another 100,000 years, with only neutrinos disappearing immediately?
