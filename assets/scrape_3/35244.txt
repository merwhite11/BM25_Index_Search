Does the image of the cosmic microwave background radiation show us what the universe used to look like?

Is it possible to interpolate using the cosmic microwave background radiation and currently what we can see in the sky at night to predict what the night sky will look like in the future? Iâ€™m guessing the night sky will be increasingly bright regardless of light pollution on earths because more light from galaxies will reach us in more time?  If we can interpolate forwards, would we be also to interpolate backwards?
From my understanding, the cosmic microwave background radiation is what the universe used to look like.
