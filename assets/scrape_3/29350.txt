Could some bacteria theoretically evolve to survive in space?

There is no edge to the atmosphere, and therefor I expect there would be a gradual reduction of concentrations of bacteria as we ascend into space. Logically anaerobic bacteria should be able to obtain its energy from the sun and nutrients from whatever scarce but available organic floating materials. Cosmic rays and high energy particles could damage DNA, but there might be someway life could protect itself against them. Could it be that bacteria is evolving/ has already evolved at the edge of the atmosphere to live in space?
