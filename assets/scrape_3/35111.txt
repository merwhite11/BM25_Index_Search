I saw this ball of light moving across the sky

As I stated in the title, I saw this ball of light moving across the sky. It wasn't moving fast, but it wasn't moving slow.
So, I was sitting my dad's car when I looked through the windshield and at the sky to see a ball of (white) light moving across the sky. It wasn't small like the other stars, it was actually really big compared to them. It was kind of quickly moving across the sky before it faded. I thought it was a pane but the light didn't re-appear.  I then thought it was a shooting star, but after some research, I realised I was once again wrong.
I've seen this before, yet I still can't find out what it is.
Maybe some of you know what it is..?
