how are the celestial objects measured?

So I am guessing that chemical composition of the starts is measured using the spectrum analysis of waves emitted by them. But what if the spectrum is super packed by different wave lengths?
How do we calculate the weight of the object?
How do we calculate the size?
How do we calculate the distance and speed of the object?
How are we sure that light traveling towards Earth is not emitted by some other object behind the subject?
I can imagine that error margin in those calculations is super high as the distances and values are also super large.
