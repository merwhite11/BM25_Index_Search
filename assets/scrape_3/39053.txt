Why were the Magellanic Clouds named that way?

From the Wikipedia article, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds were observed prior to Magellan's expedition, and the name only stuck long after Magellan's expedition (at first, they were called nubecula major and nubecula minor, or Large Cloud and Small Cloud). So why were they finally named after Magellan?
