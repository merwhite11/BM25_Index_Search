Can hawking radiation be eaten by another blackhole?

Just a theory, from this video. At last, only the black holes are gonna exist and even they'll decay because of hawkings radiation.
As black holes emit hawkings radiation, then if one emits it, another should absorb it, this will create infinite loop kind of thing & universe is never gonna be empty as blackholes will keep on refilling!
Question: Can a black hole absorb hawkings radiation from another black hole?
(this question is quite obvious if we think that black holes can absorb anything but how's that gonna make the universe empty)
