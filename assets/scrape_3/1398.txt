Could the earth's atmosphere have been partially stripped by a passing rogue planet?

I am involved in the fight between palaeontologists and aerodynamicists on the theoretical flight capabilities of the largest pterosaurs (who reached their climax in the Cretaceous and then disappeared at the K/T extinction event).
Is it possible that the earth's atmosphere was reduced at this time by a passing rogue planet or other sufficiently large body?
If so, the atmosphere would have been thicker.
Using the principle of Occam's razor, this one single hypothesis solves the problem of flight in the Mesozoic; the problem of how the dinosaurs could carry such weight; why they all had tails that would be much more use in a thick medium such as water...
The K/T extinction has attracted too many theories about what was 'added' to life on earth such as the comet/asteroid/Deccan Traps theories etc. No-one has looked at what might have been taken away from earth to cause the same effect!
If the earth's atmosphere had been much thicker (far higher pressure/density at the surface) the dinosaurs would have had a much easier time. Losing a huge amount of their atmosphere would kill them off because their 'effective weight' would have been doubled almost overnight.
