Physical laws in other universes

In the theory of multi-verses, we can imagine countless other universes where the constants of nature, including the amount of dark energy in a volume of space and possibly even shapes of hidden dimensions vary from one universe to another. Is there sound reasoning to believe that the mathematics of nature (or laws of nature) would be the same in other universes?
