Was Milky Way formed after Sagittarius A Explosion?

Is it possible that most galaxies (and our galaxy) were formed from leftovers of supernova explosions?
In order to have a black hole 4,000,000 x solar mass the initial mass of the star should have been even greater. 
So I was thinking, is it possible that after the big bang, gas formed much bigger stars 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000x bigger than the sun, which later exploded forming: 

black holes in the middle of future galaxies
Gas, which later created smaller stars, planets, etc.

Am I trying to reinvent a bicycle here?
