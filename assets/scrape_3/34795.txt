If you put all planets between earth and moon what would happen?

It's often discussed that you can fit all the planets in the space between the Earth and the Moon. But if they actually did teleport there instantly what would happen next?
Assuming their initial direction and velocity was the least problematic, the most likely to "work". Would they all smash together or fling apart? Or do we have any idea?
