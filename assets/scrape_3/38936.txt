What is this planet or satellite in this picture?


I took this photo in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China, 38°13'N 115°18'E
(+38.23, +115.31) on the night of February 8, 2020. Here you can see a round object above the moon, and it was moving fast,the first photo was shot on 19:32:24, and the second was shot on 19:31:46. Can you please tell me what it was? Now that I have checked on SkyView Free, it seemed to be in the location of Pollux, but I don't think it was because it was big and it seemed like a planet which did not glow.
