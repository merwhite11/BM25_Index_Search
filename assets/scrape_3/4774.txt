Are there a lot of collisions between stars in the core of the galaxy?

I'm reading on Wikipedia about Halo Stars that orbit the center of the galaxy at a high inclination away from the plane of the Milky Way.  It seems that at some point, these stars must dive back into the core of our galaxy at very high relative velocities.  This causes me to wonder...wouldn't this, combined with the greater density of stars in the core, cause a large number of stellar collisions in the galactic core?
