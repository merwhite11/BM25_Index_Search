Is it possible to disprove geocentrism without telescopes?

The development of telescopes enabled the discovery of moons orbiting around Jupiter, and the existence of a full set of phases of Venus, as opposed to a limited set which would be predicted by geocentrism.
But is it possible to disprove, or at least make implausible, geocentrism without a telescope? Preferably without calculus or more advanced maths.
I'm curious for two reasons. One is knowing whether it was lack of technology, or humanity's attitude towards the universe, that was responsible for geocentrism. The other is that I've heard that some astronomical facts, such as the size of the earth, were calculated before the advent of telescopes, and I'd find it interesting if more facts could have been deduced even with a limited set of technology.
