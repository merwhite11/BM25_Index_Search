Is the Ordovician meteor event detectable in the lunar cratering record?

Approximately 468 million years ago there were a large number of L-chondrite meteorites falling to Earth. This is called the Ordovician meteor event and was probably the result of a large collision in the asteroid belt.
Does the lunar cratering record also show evidence of this event?
