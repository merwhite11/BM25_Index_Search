Can the moon turn red even without an eclipse?

My friend posted a picture of the moon as if there was an eclipse because it was so red but there wasn't a scheduled eclipse at the time (it was last night, from the Philippines). 
I'm a little concerned because how else is that possible? It was in Manila so I guess there was a lot of smoke in the air but I don't know if that's the reason behind the moon's redness.
