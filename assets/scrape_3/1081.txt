Are there any alternative explanations for the gravitational force we attribute to dark matter?

It always seemed counter-intuitive to me that we observed an measured a gravitational force and since the universe has not enough mass to account for it, the conclusion was to say there's a different kind of matter wich doesn't interact with ordinary matter nor can be seen o measured.
What if the force was applied by other adjacent or overlapsed universes or by something completely different? Are there any other theories propossed? or would we just call whatever we find out to be the source of this force "Dark matter" even if itÂ´s nothing alike matter?
