If an object 1 billion light years away emits light, does it take more than 1 billion years to reach us because of the expansion of the universe?

From page 7 of the recent (September 26, 2020) edition of Science News Magazine:

Detected May 21, 2019, the gravitational waves came from a source about 17 billion light-years from Earth, making this the most distant
confirmed detection.  Because of the universe's expansion, that
distance corresponds to a travel time of about 7 billion years,
meaning the gravitational waves were emitted when the universe was
about half its current age.

But that means the object(s) were only about 4 billion light-years or so away when the merger of two black holes occurred, right?  But it take 7 billion light-years, rather than approximately four, for the gravitational waves to reach us because of the expansion of the universe itself?
Is there an online calculator that can calculate this?  Does anybody know the equation(s) interconverting current distance, original distance and travel time of the radiation?
