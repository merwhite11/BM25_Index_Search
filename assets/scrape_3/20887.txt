If the density of nebular distribution increases symmetrically in all directions, how does space curvature explain it?

Edwin Hubble, in The Observational Approach to Cosmology, wrote

Thus the density of the nebular distribution increases outwards,
  symmetrically in all directions, leaving the observer in a unique position. Such a favoured position, of course, is intolerable.

My first question is: do more recent observations still show a symmetrical nebulae density increase? Or did Hubble just do a miscalculation, misinterpretation of an observation etc.?
Apparently, Hubble can solve this problem with spatial curvature. Further below, he writes

Therefore, in order to restore homogeneity, and to escape the horror of a unique position, the departures from uniformity, which are introduced by the recession factors, must be compensated by the second term representing effects of spatial curvature. - There seems to be no other escape.

I understand how an expanding Universe explains the symmetrical redshift, but I fail to understand how it explains the symmetrical increase of nebulae density.
