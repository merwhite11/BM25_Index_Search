How much telescope do I actually need for astrophotography?

I've done the 'sparkly curtains behind landscapes' form of astrophotography for years with DSLRs, lately full frame Nikon. I know what I'm doing with the camera, and want to take the next step into incompetence with telescopes to point at stars with a camera attached, but I'm getting conflicting advice on what kit I need.
One group are saying 'basic motorised Newtonian will be fine' - e.g.

Another are saying 'that's not powerful enough, you need a cadiotropic goto like

They're obviously very different bits of kit...! And I can see both arguments TBH. Either one is trying to waste my time with inadequate kit, or another to waste my money into his pocket with overspecified kit.
Help....?
