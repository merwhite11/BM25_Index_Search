Could the solar system survive in a void?

If the solar system were suddenly placed in the middle of a large void... would everything still function as normal?
Would we even notice any difference here on Earth apart from the night sky?
...and speaking of the night sky, would that even look much different to how it is already? I imagine just less colourful and and more sparse, but seeing whole galaxies instead of individual stars?
Or would moving the solar system into a void just mean the end of the world as we know it?
