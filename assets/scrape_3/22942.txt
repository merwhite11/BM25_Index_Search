Is an expanding universe equivalent to a universe in which everything is shrinking?

Why do we always think of the universe as expanding? 
Surely, from our perspective an expanding universe would look exactly the same as a universe in which everything is shrinking away from everything else? "Oh, but the red shift!" I hear people exclaim. Well how about this:

The speed of light is simply slowing down.

Hear me out. If the speed of light is a measuring stick against which all things are measured, and if the speed of light is slowing down, then it means everything shrinks and high frequency waves generated in the past are observed with a lower frequency today, which causes us to make observations that the universe is expanding.
What is wrong with my alternative?
Given this, if the speed of light were experiencing, say, exponential decay, wouldn't we expect to see the universe's 'expansion' accelerating? (which I thought was a relatively new and profound discovery)
Apologies if the question is silly, I've never made a formal study of physics and the universe, but this has always baffled me and I haven't been able to find an explanation
