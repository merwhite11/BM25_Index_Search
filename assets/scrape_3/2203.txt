How are East and West defined on other bodies of our solar system?

I noticed that East and West appear swapped on maps of the Sun, even though the Sun rotates around its polar axis in the same sense as Earth.
See for example below Sun disk with a Venus transit diagram or also here.
So, at least for the Sun, East and West are defined from an Earth observer viewpoint. This makes me wonder: How are East and West defined on other bodies of our solar system?
