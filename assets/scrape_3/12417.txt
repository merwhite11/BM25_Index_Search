Why does gravity increase in star formation?

When a star ignites ( ie. fusion starts ), the star maintains its form by balancing gravity's inward pressure, and radiation's outward pressure.
I get that the fusion of hydrogen atoms releases energy... fine...
How does gravity keep it together if the mass is lessening as a result of fusion( mass being converted into energy from fusion) while gravity is weakening( as mass lessens )?
Wouldn't the radiation overpower the force of gravity and tear the star apart?
