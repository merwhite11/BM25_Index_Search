Which lens and magnification is best to see planets?

I just bought a Celestron Travel Scope 70 and it comes with a 20mm and a 10mm eyepiece. I get a good view of the Moon but I am not able to see Jupiter, Saturn or Mars as expected. I read about the Barlow lens but I am not sure how much magnification is required to view these planets. So based on my telescope, which lens should I go for? And should I also get Red/Blue filters to view them?
