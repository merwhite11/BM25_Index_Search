What does it mean for a black hole to "evaporate"?

It says in this Wikipedia's article:

Entropy, however, implies heat and therefore temperature. The loss of energy also suggests that black holes do not last forever, but rather "evaporate" slowly.

Would a black hole, given enough time, dissapear? Has this happened before?
