What is a 'hybrid' eclipse?

As mentioned on the NASA eclipse website the eclipse on the 3rd of November 2013 will be a "Hybrid" eclipse.
I have looked at the diagram on that page but can't see what is different about the eclipse that would explain the word hybrid. This terminology also confuses me:

It is one of the rare hybrid or annular/total eclipses in which some sections of the path are annular while other parts are total.
