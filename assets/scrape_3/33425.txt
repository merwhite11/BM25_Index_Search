How many Moon's Topocentric Conjunction occurs per lunar month?

It is clear that only one Moon's Geocentric Conjunction occurs per lunar month, what about the Topocentric Conjunction for a given location?
without scale I can imagine many Topocentric Conjunctions as shown in the pictures below:
yellow disk : Sun
gray disk   : Moon
blue disk   : Earth
yellow box  : Observer's Location
red line    : Conjunction's Line
