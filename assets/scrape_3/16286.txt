How can I convolve a template spectrum with a photometric filter response spectrum?

Suppose I have a template stellar population spectrum (say, from Bruzual & Charlot 2003) which runs from like 1000 Angstroms to 160,000 Angstroms and which has x-axis wavelength units of Angstroms and y-axis flux density units of $L_{\odot}$ per Angstrom. Now, let's say I want to get the integrated luminosity within a bandpass that runs from $\lambda_1$ to $\lambda_2$ Angstroms, and I have another "spectrum" which gives me the filter response function for this photometric bandpass. 
I know that I'm supposed to "convolve the stellar template spectrum with the bandpass response function" in order to get the integrated stellar luminosity within my bandpass, but how do I do this exactly (preferably in python)? The stellar template and filter response spectra don't have the same number of data points and are not defined on the same wavelength grid (the stellar template spectrum obviously extends much further than the filter response function). 
I feel like I could interpolate the filter response spectrum onto the wavelength array of the stellar template spectrum, and assign a value of 0 to the interpolated response spectrum for wavelengths outside $\lambda_1$ to $\lambda_2$. Then I would be able to do a simple element-wise multiplication, but this does not seem like the correct approach using traditional "convolution."
