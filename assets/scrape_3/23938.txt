How can I interpolate 2 orbits

My question is very similar to this one although the answer is not what I was looking for.
Basically I'm working in a space game (KSP) and I'm making it multiplayer. The clients send a packet with their orbital parameters at a interval (30 miliseconds by default) but between those packets I want to interpolate and draw an orbit between those 2 packets.
For normal vectors or speed I use linear interpolation:
private static float Lerp(float v0, float v1, float t)
{
    return (1 - t) * v0 + t * v1;
}

But It doesn't work well when I work with orbits
var inclination = Lerp(inclination, Target.inclination, lerpPercentage),
var eccentricity = Lerp(eccentricity, Target.eccentricity, lerpPercentage),
var semiMajorAxis = Lerp(semiMajorAxis, Target.semiMajorAxis, lerpPercentage),
var LAN = Lerp(LAN, Target.LAN, lerpPercentage),
var argumentOfPeriapsis = Lerp(argumentOfPeriapsis, Target.argumentOfPeriapsis, lerpPercentage),
var meanAnomalyAtEpoch = Lerp(meanAnomalyAtEpoch, Target.meanAnomalyAtEpoch, lerpPercentage),
var epoch = Lerp(epoch, Target.epoch, lerpPercentage),

What function can I use to interpolate them?
