Could we detect if Oumuamua asteroid wasn't an asteroid?

If Oumuamua wasn't an asteroid, could we detect that it is not an asteroid?
Disclaimer: I do NOT suggest that Oumuamua is in fact an alien spacecraft, a giant coffin, or a statue of Weird Al.
Since it apparently has a very unusual shape, if this is something else, with a different material (neither rock nor ice), could we detect that something is unusual?
