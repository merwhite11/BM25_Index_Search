What would happen if a Black Hole and White Hole Collided?

Given our understanding of both black holes and white holes, what would be the outcome if they were both to suddenly collide?
Black Holes:

A black hole is a region of spacetime from which gravity prevents
  anything, including light, from escaping. The theory of general
  relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform
  spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which
  no escape is possible is called the event horizon.

White Holes:

In general relativity, a white hole is a hypothetical region of
  spacetime which cannot be entered from the outside, although matter
  and light can escape from it.
