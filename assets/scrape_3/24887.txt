Dark matter virtual objects hypothesis

I've hypothesized for many years in my head that dark matter are the gravitational after effects of objects that have exploded. My understanding of physics is that when an object explodes, its center of mass remains in the same location. If that's the case, it seems that the gravity of that center of mass could remain. What observations or theories are there that counteract this hypothesis?
