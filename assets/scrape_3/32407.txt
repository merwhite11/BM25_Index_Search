Higgs Field inside a White Dwarf

White dwarfs rank among the hottest things in the universe.In the early years of the life of the universe ,universe was very hot and the Higgs field was deactivated causing all the particles generated by quantum flunctuations to travel at the speed  of light(being massless).Is the Higgs field inside a white dwarf also deactivated so any pair of particles-antiparticles will travel at the speed of light?
