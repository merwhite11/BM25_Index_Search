Is the surface of TrES-2b actually dark?

The exoplanet TrES-2b is known as the darkest planet ever found, reflecting <1% of the light that hits it.
What does it mean in respect to the surface? What would we see below the atmosphere of this planet? Is it a "shadow planet" with an atmosphere so thick and dense that it blocks all light that would reach the surface?
