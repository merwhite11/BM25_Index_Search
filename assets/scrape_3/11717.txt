When a neutron star accretes matter, will its mass increase?

When a nova gets matter, the outcome is that it may lose more matter because of eruptions. Only some kind of nova's masses can increase stably. 
A white dwarf may become a supernova after it exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, and we study that much. A neutron star can get mass too, why do not we talk about their end much?
How about a neutron star when it gets matter from accretion? It is necessary that its mass will increase? 
When will it collapse?
