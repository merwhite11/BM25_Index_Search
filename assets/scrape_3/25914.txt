My first pictures of Jupiter

Well, I'll start off by saying I am certain I am doing it wrong! Now that I got that out of the way here is my image:


I have a feeling I can't see the planet because I need a filter to block out the light surrounding Jupiter, however I honestly didn't expect to have such a profound atmosphere-like disc around Jupiter. 
My fiance thought it was my own eye being projected, but it was a DSLR doing the actual looking. 
I am using the Celestron NexStar 127 SLT which comes stock with a 25mm and 9mm eyepiece. 
Update:
Okay! I focused and was able to see Jupiter, including some aspects of its atmosphere. However, I was not able to take a descent picture of it. Now I'm thinking the need for filters and proper DSLR usage methods will come into play.
