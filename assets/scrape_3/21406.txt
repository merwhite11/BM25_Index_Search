Other than relative temperatures, is there any difference between a red sun and a yellow sun?

As time goes by, explanations for unusual things that exist in fiction get disproven. We know radiation probably isn't going to create a Giant ant that destroys everything, we're pretty sure we can't use ray guns, and the idea that falling into a black hole would put you face to face with Ming the Merciless is laughable.
Comic nerds might have guessed from the title why I'm asking, but I'm curious if there could still be any reason to latch on to to explain why superman is powered by a yellow sun, but not a red one? Does the higher temperature of a yellow sun create a higher level of some concentration of exotic particles, or once you get to the point of [solar fusion] is the output pretty much exactly the same?
Note: This question is not about superman, or his powers, just if there is any (temperature aside) meaningful difference between a yellow and red sun (that could be conveniently used by DC to still justify superman's powers).
