How do proto-planetary nebulae gain momentum?

currently I am curious about proto-planetary nebulae. At first I was curious about how planets spin but I read in a couple of articles that they got their spin from when they were in a proto-planetary nebula and the momentum stayed because of conservation of momentum. But now a new question arises, where exactly do proto-planetary nebula's get their momentum from? I've searched this up on the internet but I haven't really gotten a clear response.
