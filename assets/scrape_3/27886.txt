How much more atmosphere is the sun passing through at sunset as opposed to at its peak in the sky?

I was looking at the sun during a sunset earlier today and wondered how much atmosphere you need to be able to look directly at the sun without damaging your eyes. The thought crossed my mind because I was continuously driving into an extremely oppressive sunset, my eyes were battered by the sun continuously for about a half an hour. Then, suddenly, the sun became more and more dull as it lowered into the sky. 
My question is: 
What is the approximate ratio of atmosphere between the sun and me, when setting as compared to when its positioned at a peak point in the sky? If you have the math behind an approximation like this from a topological observer, I would love to see that worked out.
