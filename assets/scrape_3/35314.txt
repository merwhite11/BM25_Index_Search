Why does moon moves to side if I change my position directly into it?

I've setup this scenario on Stellarium where the moon is aligned with East direction. I wanted to see the change of altitude of the moon if I move straight into its direction (time of observation is always the same) but instead it keeps changing its direction to the left. I expected to keep on the same azimuth and only change altitude but no, and I don't understand the geometric reason of it, for example If I walk in a straight line towards a building it won't move right or left. On the equator works as I expected.
