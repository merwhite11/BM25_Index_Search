Is the North star going to stay in the North sky?

Considering how the our solar system, and how every other star in the galaxy is traveling through the cosmos, it seems like it's a miracle that the stars and constellations in the sky stay as constant as they are.  

How is it that the North Star seems to be fixed in space? Is it following our star through space? are we following it? Is it actually moving? Are we getting further away from it? Closer to it? What is our relationship to Polaris in the Galaxy?
