What to expect to see

I have telescope with a diameter of 60 mm and a focal length of 900 mm. I have a 2x Barlow lens and eyepieces with focal lengths of 10 mm. Can I see any details of any galaxies? Andromeda for an example? What galaxy is the best for watching with this small telescope? I have f15.
I can view one galaxy but I don't know what exactly. It looks really small with no details.
What do you suggest I try to find in the sky? I viewed Saturn and I was delighted.
