I saw 3 consecutive object disappearing in the sky at same nearby location

I was roaming on my terrace and I saw star-like moving object that gradually became small, red colour and disappear. Within a few minutes I saw another similar-looking  object a little distance away coming from opposite of first one and disappearing with red colour at nearly the same location. Within 5-6 minutes, I saw another similar object that soon disappeared. The object was moving from a lower altitude to a higher one. What was it?
