Why is the SETI survey limited to only Red Dwarf Stars?

I was going through the official SETI website, when I came across this article on the same website which said :

Today, the SETI Institute uses a specially designed instrument for its SETI efforts â€“ the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) located in the Cascade Mountains of California. The ATA is embarking upon a two-year survey of tens of thousands of red dwarf stars, which have many characteristics that make them prime locales in the search for intelligent life.

The part that I was not able to understand was :  The ATA is embarking upon a two-year survey of tens of thousands of red dwarf stars, which have many characteristics that make them prime locales in the search for intelligent life.
So my question is : Why is the SETI survey limited to only Red Dwarf Stars? Is there something special about them that I seem to be missing?
Also, is this survey still active?
