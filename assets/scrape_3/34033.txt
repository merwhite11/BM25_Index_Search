The colour of blue dwarf stars

The paper "M dwarfs: planet formation and long term evolution" describes blue dwarf stars, a hypothetical next-stage in the lifespan of red dwarf stars within a certain mass range, after which they become white dwarves.
(Hypothetical because the universe is not old enough for any red dwarves to have reached this stage.)
The Hertzsprung Russell diagram on page 917 of this paper, if I've interpreted it correctly (I'd never seen one of these until recently!), shows red dwarves in the 0.14-0.16 solar mass range progressing further away from the "red" end of the spectrum and in the direction of the blue. But it does not actually depict their surface temperature reaching - or indeed exeeding - 9000K (spectral type A, instead of the B or O-type that are normally considered blue enough to justify the name.)

Am I correct that "blue dwarf" stars would not, according to this paper's H-R diagram, actually ever get past "white", and are thus named because they've moved a long way from the red end of the spectrum toward the blue? I have seen different colour charts depict different levels of blueness for the O, B and A types while researching this question, although the majority consensus seems to be that A types are almost entirely white with only a very small amount of blue.
(The same Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is also shown on page 424 of the 1997 paper "The End of the Main Sequence", if that helps at all.)
