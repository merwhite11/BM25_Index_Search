How can we tell the difference between matter and antimatter by observation in space?

I just was wondering and searching on the internet with little luck in the topic. On Antimatter Wiki they tell the observable universe is built up by matter. I read antimatter can be detected in cosmic rays in very small quantity. But let's go in theories and our practical knowledge, my question is:
How could we detect if a set of objects (like an entire galaxy) is completely built up by antimatter? Since matter and antimatter look like "mirror image" on current, could they form a similar object which is indistinguishable from "our" matter objects? I mean, would spectrum analysis for example show that it is not matter, but built up by antimatter?
