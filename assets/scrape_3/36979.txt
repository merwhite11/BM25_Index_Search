If Planet Nine is a primordial black hole could it explain 'Oumuamua and Borisov's orbits without them being interstellar?

There has been an increasing amount of interest in the possibility of primordial black holes and that Planet Nine may be one itself.  Planet Nine is a potential explanation for the orbital characteristics of various TNOs (trans-Neptunian object).  I'm curious if it would be possible for our two interstellar visitors ('Oumuamua and Borisov) to be from this solar system but have been given a gravitational assist by a small black hole to provide them with their high eccentricity.  I further wonder if the elongation of the low density 'Oumuamua could be due the effects of a close orbit around a small object of unusual large density.
