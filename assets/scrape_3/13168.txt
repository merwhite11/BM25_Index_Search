Do massive OB stars accrete mass the same way as the black holes they turn into do?

It is often said, in spite of sci fi often having illustrated the opposite, that stellar mass black holes do not gravitationally attract material in their environment into themselves anymore than a star with similar mass does. But how and why do blue stars of about 8-10 or more Solar masses which turn into black holes, change how frequently and observably they accrete material from their environment when they transform into BH? Maybe because the supernova ejects material, some of which doesn't get far and is re-accreted when the stellar wind ceases?
BH's are visible when they have active accretion disks. Do massive O and B stars also have such accretion disks as frequently?
