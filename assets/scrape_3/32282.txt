How do we know the radius of the universe is 47 billion light years?

Hubble deep field image at maximum resolution shows a few of the furthest galaxies very small & faint, only just visible, but suggests that there is more to see beyond if only the resolution were high enough. I know the age of the universe is 'only' about 14 billion years, but if Hubble can only show galaxies 13.2 billion light years away, how do we know the radius of the universe is 47 billion light years?
