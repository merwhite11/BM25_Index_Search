High quality, detailed images of planets on web

I have been looking for images of the planets and have found pretty decent ones of Earth and Venus from NASA.

That detail is opposed to this one of Uranus:

And these of Mars, (and this and this)

I am disappointed in the quality of the public domain images from NASA I have found for these planets:

Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus
Neptune
Pluto
Earth's Moon

I am happy with the ones found for:

Mercury
Venus
Earth

They seem to be high quality in terms of detail and pixel size (in the MBs).
Wondering if one could explain how I go about finding these public domain planet images from NASA (or elsewhere, but I imagine they are all from the Hubble telescope, I don't know too much) that are high quality in terms of detail and pixels/size. If nothing else it would be helpful to simply link to them if there is no pattern to where they are located.
If there is a pattern to where the high quality images are located, I would be interested too to find ones of comets/asteroids/stars. I have found many high quality images of galaxies which is neat, but not of the planets yet.
