How can I get/generate/extract PSF image from galaxy .fits image?

I want to model an image of a galaxy from Hubble.
For this, I need the PSF image as well.
I already tried to use TinyTim, but I don't have half of the parameters and cant be sure about the quality of output.
Is there any way for me to get it from the .fits image of a galaxy?
