Difference between quiet, enhanced and active networks

For my research about the sun activity I need to process pictures of the sun. I want the pictures to show 3 stages the quiet, enhanced and active network. I couldn't find any information in the internet about how these 3 networks actually look and how they differ from each other. Can somebody explain this to me? What is showing on which picture?
