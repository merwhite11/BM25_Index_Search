Are they talking about the observable universe or the unobservable universe?

When people say that 95% of the universe is dark matter and dark energy, are they talking about it being in the observable universe or the unobservable universe?
Because surely all matter in the universe must have a gravitational pull because it has mass, just because we dont see it anymore doesn't mean it's force has disappeared from the observable universe?
So what if the matter we can't see outside the observable universe shows itself by imposing its gravitational forces on everything we can see within the observable universe?
