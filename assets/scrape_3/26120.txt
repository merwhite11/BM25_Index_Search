Why is cosmological event horizon closer to us than the particle horizon?

From what I learned, cosmological event horizon is the horizon that moves away from us at/more than the speed of light. And particle horizon is the horizon that particles inside the horizon can have a causal connection with us. It is the maximum distance from which particles could have traveled to the observer in the age of the universe. This simply indicates a contradiction to me. How is it possible that the cosmological event horizon is closer?
