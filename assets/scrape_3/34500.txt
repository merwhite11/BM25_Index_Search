Kepler's equation and eccentric anomaly

From the wiki article about eccentric anomaly follows:
$$\cos E = \frac{x}{a}$$
$$\sin E = \frac{y}{b}$$
where E - eccentric anomaly, a - semi-major axis, b - semi-minor axis, P = P(x,y) a point on elleptic orbit. So if you know an E, you can find a position on an orbit:
$$x = a \cos E$$
$$y = b \sin E$$
However, from article on Kepler's eqution follows:
$$x = a (\cos E - e)$$
$$y = b \sin E$$
Please, help to understand why these formaluae differ? I expect them to be the same.
