How can gravity lead to the Big Crunch scenario?

According to modern cosmology, space is expanding, causing proper distances (but not comoving distances) to increase between galaxies. In the Big Crunch hypothesis, gravity halts and reverses the expansion of the Universe, causing all matter to collide and eventually form a single black hole. This gives way to other oscillating universe hypotheses, which generally propose that the conditions in a compressed Universe would be the same as those during the Big Bang, leading a cycle of expanding and contracting universes.
Ignoring the problems with entropy in reverting the Universe to Big Bang conditions, how can gravity be the cause of a Big Crunch in the first place? Specifically, gravity (to my knowledge) only curves space; the idea that it can revert the Universe to the conditions of the Big Bang seems to imply that gravity actually can contract space. Is this actually the case?
If not, the gravitating objects should be moving through a comoving coordinate system, so space itself would not actually be contracting. As far as I can tell, we would have all the Universe's matter compressed within a single point in space, instead of space itself contracting. This should be completely unlike the Big Bang, when space was far less dilated than it is now. If this is in fact what the Big Crunch hypothesis describes, than I'm utterly confused as to how an oscillating universe could work in such a situation.
Am I mistaken, or do the Big Crunch and oscillating universe hypotheses imply that gravity actually contracts space (as in, the comoving distances of gravitationally attracting objects would not change)? If not, how could gravity possibly lead to these scenarios?
