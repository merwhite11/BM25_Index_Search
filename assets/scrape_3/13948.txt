Is it safe to watch solar eclipse's reflection in water?

There will be a solar eclipse soon at my area... naturally I want to watch this with my son.
Is it safe for us to watch the solar eclipse's reflection in the water? There is a swimming pool near my house and I plan to watch it there.. is it safe to do so?
I remember vividly doing this with my dad when I was little, but some website says we are not supposed to watch it in a bucket of water..
So is it ok to watch it in the water?
