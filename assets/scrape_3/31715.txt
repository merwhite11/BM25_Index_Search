How accurate are the new visualisations of V404 Cygni

A number of pictures and some animations similar to the ones below have had much press recently. Clearly the colours are artificial, but I wondered how accurately the represent the geometry of the system -- the relative sizes of the event horizon and the thin and thick accretion disks, the distance from the companion star, and so on.
Does anyone know.


The images are taken from popular press sites, but seem to originate from ICRAR, where they are described as "artists impressions". I would nevertheless be interested to know how accurate a brief their artists were working from.
