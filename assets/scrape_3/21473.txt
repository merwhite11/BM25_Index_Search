What are these objects on the night sky generally between 8:00 and 11:00 PM?

Many time I saw a moving star in the night generally been 08:00 to 11:00 PM. It is not any satellite, because it move in all directions, although it moves in a straight line. Sometimes from north to south, and sometimes from east to west and vice versa.
It is also not a comet, because its brightness is continuous, and it moves continuously in a direction. It is also not a plane âœˆ, because in the night a plane is travelling with three-four coloured light. And they generally do not move on the way of planes.
What are those moving stars?
