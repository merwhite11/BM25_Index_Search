Water Ice on Meteorites

I was reading an article by David O'Brien et al. where it stated

"in meteorites only the water bound to the silicates can be found, all the water ice having been lost, whereas on asteroids water ice itself has been detected"

Now this was published in 2014, so I'm wondering what is the validity of this statement today. Have we, since the publication of this article, discovered water ice on meteorites?
