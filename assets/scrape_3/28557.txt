What would the night sky look like from a planet at the centre of a ring galaxy?

If there were an observer on a planet in the centre of a ring galaxy (omitting the galactic core) what could they expect to see in their night sky? I am currently under the impression that their night sky would be divided by a dense band of stars stretching across the celestial sphere, similar to the milky band of our sky - though to a greater extent. But is there any reason this wouldn't be the case?
