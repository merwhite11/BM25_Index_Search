Star - Black Hole binary. Star core Collapses. Does the black hole immediately grow from neutrinos?

I was reading on how Type II Supernovae release as much as 99% of their energy as neutrinos. So I was thinking: suppose there was a large star and black hole binary system, but the two were not close enough for the BH to draw mass out of the star, so the star aged naturally instead.
If one were close enough to observe when the star's core collapses - but before the supernova bursts through the star's surface - would it be possible to see the black hole immediately grow in size for no apparent reason as it eats up the neutrinos from the companion star's collapse?
