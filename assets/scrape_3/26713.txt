Will the Sun's solar wind push a permanent magnet out of our solar system?

If you were place a strong permanent magnet into the solar wind, like a 1 inch cube neodymium magnet, would the charged particles of the solar wind colliding with the magnet's magnetic field push the magnet out of our solar system, that being if it does not encounter any planets or objects in its path?
