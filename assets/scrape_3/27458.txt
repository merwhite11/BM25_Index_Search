Can Mercury's core "boil over" if it gets to close to the Sun?

I was reading about how Mercury's core makes up most of the volume of the planet. I'm guessing this is both because of the small size and the distance to the Sun. If Mercury got too hot could it completely "liquidify"? Would it join the Sun and completely merge with it, gradually crack apart and spread, or something else entirely? Would it cause other problems in terms of life on Earth?
