Distinction between metric expansion and objects just moving apart from each other?

I see explanations likes this:

Galaxies and other sources, then, are not strictly expanding away from each other but rather are attached to the fixed grid on the expanding fabric of spacetime. Thus, the galaxies give us the impression of moving away from each other. (Scientific American)
[...] space is expanding [...] the most correct way to think about it would be that the grid points are getting farther apart. (Physics.se)

How have we determined that it is some underlying grid or space itself that is expanding rather than the objects just moving apart on a static grid of spacetime?
