Is there a database for identifying the falling light I saw?

I witnessed a light fall from the sky. It was visibly about as bright as Mars, so brighter than meteorites I've seen, was just a point of light with no tail, and traveled much much faster than an aircraft. The horizon was blocked by a house, so I do not have any frame of reference for how far away it hit the ground (it could as well have been 3 miles or 10,000 miles away), but I do know the coordinates for where I was, and the direction is was relative to my position.
Is there some database I can use to search space events to learn what it was that I saw?
