Hills' mechanism for making Hypervelocity Stars


In Hill’s mechanism, the gravitational tidal force of
  a single MBH disrupts an approaching binary. One star is captured on an eccentric orbit around
  the MBH and, by conservation of energy, the other star escapes with a final velocity equal to the
  geometric mean of the ∼$10^4$ km/s
  infall velocity and the ∼$10^2$ km/s binary orbital velocity.

I don't understand how the high energy/velocity can be transferred to the star.
(Hills' 1988 Nature paper is still paywalled.)
