Could the accelerating expansion of universe inidicate we are surrounded by "denser" space?

I'm quite novice about all this, only have read some vulgarization books and sites, but I wonder: could all the observable universe be falling outwards on some non-observable, more compact kind of barrier - I'll call it "edge"? Could this be a part of the explanation of cosmological accelerated expansion?
Like say we would be in a kind of bubble, or egg-shape thing? This thing could be inflating, and the closer matter would be from the edges, the quicker it would fall? 
Good question "why would we be at the center of it?"... I know already there could be a kind of "flow" of matter at large scales which is already kind of violation of universe isotropy. Could we remove this issue with some kind gravity propagation itself?
Any sense to anybody it makes?
