How LOFAR pass through the ionosphere?

The LOFAR project open a new window in the universe's study because it allows to receive low frequences of the universe that we could not get because of the ionosphere. 
But I'm wondering how can LOFAR pass through the ionosphere? Is it because of the large fields of antennas? Or it is something else?
Thanks for any answers which can clear my mind.
