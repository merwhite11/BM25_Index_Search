Is this the Florence asteroid?


I saw this blazing thing in the sky from Chennai, India at around 21:00 IST. Is this by any chance the Florence asteroid ? If not, what is this ? I'm pretty sure that this cannot be a firecracker because it was huge with large flames and it actually lasted in sky for at least 30 seconds till it reached heights where commercial aircrafts fly. 
NOTE: This object was moving from the ground and upwards towards the atmosphere.
