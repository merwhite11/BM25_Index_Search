What will future populations of stars be like?

As stars slowly using up hydrogen and ejecting heavier elements into space, the future stars will form from nebulae that are more metal and helium rich.
The question is: how does the increased ratio of helium and metals affect star formation and stellar evolution?
Does more helium and metals in the core at the beginning means the star begins it's life in an advanced state so it dies faster?
