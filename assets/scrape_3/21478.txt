In a reflecting telescope (Cassegrain), is there a difference between using a concave or convex secondary mirror?

These are two diagrams of Cassegrain reflecting telescopes.
One uses a concave secondary mirror, and the other uses a convex one.
Is there any difference between the two?
For example, does one cost more? Does one produce a better image?
Thanks!
