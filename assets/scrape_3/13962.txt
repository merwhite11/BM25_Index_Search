How can a supernova cause a gravitational wave?

With the recent results of LIGO, I read a lot how limited the detection capabilities where and how one could only expect to measure the most extreme events like black hole mergers and supernovae.
I get the black hole mergers, since here we see an ever higher frequency gravitational interference of two large bodies. But how can a supernova cause a gravitational wave? All the mass is still there, it is just thrown out  isn't it? So from far away shouldn't the mass still be concentrated on a relatively small place and thus the gravity from the recently exploded star should remain unchanged, right?
