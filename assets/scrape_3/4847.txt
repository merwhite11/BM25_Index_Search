In regards to the holographic principle, what exactly is information?

I'm having trouble understanding what exactly "information" is in the context of the holographic principle suggested by string theory. Can it be equated to a matrix of ones and zeros? Does this information have its own laws of physics or are all laws of physics in our universe a result of this information, as in, does information supersede everything?
