Is the Big Bounce Theory valid? If so does that mean all this have happened before?

IF the universe is just an infinite loop of events from expanding to contracting does that mean all this has happened before? The initial conditions for the next big bang would (or rather could) be the same as ours which would result everything happening in the exact same way. I could be way off but it's really strange thinking all of this has happened "before" like the time of arrow is somehow looped and we're all living the same life over and over again without even realizing it.
