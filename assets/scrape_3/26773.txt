Are galaxies expanding away from us at more than the speed of light?

If you go to the following video, at this certain time:
https://youtu.be/Iy7NzjCmUf0?t=435
you will see that the narrator says:

"We simply don't know what else is out there because the light from these incredibly distant places has not yet had enough time in the universes history to reach us yet back on Earth. And the light from some places might never reach us at all. Because some parts of space, very far from Earth, are expanding away from us, faster then the speed of light, that means that the light from these places will never, in an infinite amount of time reach Earth" 

Am I understanding this correctly? Some parts in the universe are expanding faster then the speed of light? Is it yet proven that there are definitely things faster then the speed of light?
I feel like I am misunderstanding the above statement.
P.S, try watching the entire video, it will be 10 minutes well spent.
