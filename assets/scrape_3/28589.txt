Is the universe always expanding

Currently we observe that the universe is expanding. And this expansion even goes faster and faster.
Why do we know (or presume) that this expansion started slowly at a singularity (i.e. big bang) and is getting faster and faster?
Did a serious scientist ever presumed that the universe might be oscillating, i.e. like a breathing bubble? Currently the universe is expanding but who knows, perhaps in 1 Million year we will observe a shrinking universe and 3 Million year later again expanding - provided the humans will still exist at this time which I doubt.
Of course, this would open many new questions like: How and when did it start? What is the frequency and amplitude? But let's keep this question off side.
