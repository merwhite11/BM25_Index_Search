Do constellations change?

Many stars are part of constellations. Due to dark matter the stars have velocities which are nearly the same unregardless their radius of orbit around the centre of the Milky Way. Also, it takes about 200 million years to orbit this centre. But nevertheless the angle from which we look at those stars could change a bit during this orbit.
Regarding all these effects, could you say that constellations don't change at all or does it just take a long while?  And of course stars could run out of energy and explode and vanish, so that we don't see them anymore. But is this the only way the constellations could change?
