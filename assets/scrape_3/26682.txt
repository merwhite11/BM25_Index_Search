Will a black hole swallow the universe?

If black holes swallow stuff, will a big black hole eventually swallow the universe? The universe will eventually go dark, because there will not be enough matter to make stars, and all that will be left is a bunch of black holes and they can merge. So will the universe get swallowed by a big black hole someday?
