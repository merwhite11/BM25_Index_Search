Estimation of average rock and asteroid mass associated with different stars

There is a lot of information on different star types and compositions. 
Can we make estimates of the total mass of rock, ice, and non stellar matter that orbits stars based on star evolution models?
Take, for example, the sun - are there studies of the total mass of non-solar material associated with the sun and it's composition regardless of accretion. What about nearby stars?
Can we estimate how much non-incandescent material the galaxy contains aside from dark matter?
