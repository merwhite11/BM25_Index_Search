How does the illumination of the sky from the sun compare to that of the moon?

I have trouble describing the questions but this is the best I can do.
The sun lights up the sky, until it's about 18 degrees below the horizon. The moon also lights up the sky, and i'm wondering, how does the illumination of a full moon compare to that of the sun? How many degrees does the sun have to be below the horizon to equal the illumination of a full moon?
I hope i'm clear enough. Thanks for any answers
