Why does the moon 'peel' away from the horizon in this photograph?

The Himawari-8 geostationary weather satellite recently had a lunar intrusion into it's primary sensor (the Advance Himawari Imager, or AHI):

Zooming in on the moon:

I see a strange cupping (or 'peeling') of the moon away from the horizon: 

My question is: what is the explanation for this 'peeling' aberration?
Note: if your answer involves the lunar terminator, please account for the following concerns:

At the time of day of the photograph, we see the Earth with ~5 degrees of longitude in night. The Earth presents approximately 17 degrees across from GEO, so the moon is $17^{\circ}/2=8.5^{\circ}$ degrees away from nadir, and so I expect the moon to have $5^{\circ}+8.5^{\circ}= 13.5^{\circ}$ of longitude in night. With barely half the moon peaking out above the Earth's horizon, the terminator is well behind the Earth.
The cupping aberration appears equal on both edges. The Sun is in the top right corner of the picture, and so I would expect a terminator related effect 
to be more pronounced on the bottom of the moon than the top.
