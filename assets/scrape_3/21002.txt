How to find Greenwich Mean Sideral Time?

I'm writing a program that converts position in the ECI (CIS, EPOCH JD2000.0) coordinate system to WGS 84 (CTS, ECEF) coordinates. To do so, I'm following what's described in this document and implementing C++ code.
My knowledge of astrophysics is very limited, so I find it hard to understand some terms. Especially, I can't seem to understand properly how the Greenwich Mean Sideral Time is computed, and why I always get different values.
For instance (assuming time is 2019-01-01 08:00:00 and Julian Date is 2458484.833333):

If I use this on-line GMST calculator, I find that GMST is 14:42:45.3766.
If I use the expression used in this MATLAB script (showing the value in time, not degrees) I also get 14:42:45.350.
However, if I calculate it myself with the expression given in the above appendix, I get 06:42:45.379163 (with a clear offset of

According to the equations in page A-26, GMST depends upon the number of Julian centuries (Tu). H0 expression is exactly the same than that of CelesTrak for θ(0h). However, I can't really understand what the du truly stands for, or more specifically, why the document shows du → ±0.5, 1.5, 2.5.... Moreover, to find Λ (which is stated to be in seconds of time) the expressions use values in radians and seconds of time indistinctly.
Could somebody shed light into this?
