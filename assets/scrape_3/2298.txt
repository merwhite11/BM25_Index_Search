What is visible light colour output of different stars?

I know the colours of the stars relate to their heat, however if I were standing on a different planet identical to Earth, but orbiting a blue Bright Giant or a Red Giant, or perhaps even a Red Dwarf, what colours in visible light would I be able to see? Is it the same as with our star, i.e. would any be missing such as if I'm in a room with a black light?
