What differentiates a "group of rogue stars" from a galaxy?

According to Wikipedia, a rogue star or intergalactic star is

not gravitationally bound to a galaxy.

But according to a citation on the same Wikipedia page, the first intergalactic stars were discovered in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. 

These stars form a massive group  aproximately 300,000 light years away from the nearest galaxy. (Emphasis mine)

Is there any clear, stated definition which differentiates galaxies from "massive groups of rogue stars"?
