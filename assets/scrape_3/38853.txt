Why does this large Newtonian telescope's front cover have two or three holes in it?

The Michael Bernardo video How to use an Equatorial Mount for Beginners shows a large Newtonian telescope on an equatorial mount.
The cover of the telescope's large aperture shows what looks like three holes each with its own removable sub-cover, but I might be misunderstanding what I'm looking at, perhaps the "central object" is just a handle to rotate the cover when the other two holes are open.
But that raises the question "why two holes" rather than just one. I'm pretty sure that these are not used for this kind of thing but it would be great to know how they are used!
