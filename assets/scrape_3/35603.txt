Light brightened dimmed disappeared reappeared

My son and I saw an unusual light sit in one spot for 15-20 minutes as it got very bright and dimmed, got bright, disappeared and reappeared repeatedly.
It then slowly moved north-west then finally headed west and completely disappeared. it was 45 minutes from the time we first seen it to when it disappeared. I've been searching the web since but couldn't find anything that matches the description of what I saw.
