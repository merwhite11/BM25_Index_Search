Can there be a 2nd possibility deduced from the fact that galaxies are moving away from us?

I just read that according to the BBT the universe is expanding. This is evident from the fact that distant stars (and galaxies) are moving away from us. But it could also happen that the universe is in fact shrinking to a very small point and we being far away from the point are experiencing its pull less than those that are near it. It may be like a race where a very fast (in 1st place) , a moderately fast (in 2nd place) and a slow car (at last) are racing . To the moderately fast car it would seem that the other two are moving away from it,but actually they all are moving towards the same point -the end. So it may happen that earth is like the moderately fast car moving towards the collapse point at a different relative speed. Is this proposition possible? If not,why?
