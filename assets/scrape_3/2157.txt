Cosmic microwave background radiation

If the big bang is true, after the emission of light from the hydrogen plasma, the universe was still expanding. Why would we expect to see uniform radiation if earth very well could have formed outside of this hydrogen plasma. Then we would expect to see bits of background radiation coming from one direction. People sometimes answer this question by saying that the big bang happened everywhere and that where the earth is right now was a haze of hydrogen plasma 13.7 billion years ago. I do not see how one can assume this as since the universe expands we could have formed outside of the plasma and therefore should not expect to detect uniform background radiation.
