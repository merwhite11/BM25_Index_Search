What size of the grating on GAIA RVS spectroscope ?
How many lines on mm, or what defraction angle for 850 nm wavelenth light ?
I find some more details here: http://sci.esa.int/gaia/44092-gaia-rvs-grating/ and http://sci.esa.int/gaia/44093-state-of-the-art-grating-for-gaia/
The GAIA RVS grating has dimensions of 20.5 cm Ã— 15.5 cm and 302.11 grooves per mm.
