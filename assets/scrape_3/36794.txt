Retrograde Motion: Stars in the background

I was reading about the retrograde motion of Mars. All explanations give reference to the stars in the background. But I do not understand why this is necessary. I say this since stars themselves also appear to move and can see and observe this without any references. This brings up the second point: if the stars also appear to move, why do explanations have these background stars frozen?
I am new to all this so this might be a naive question :)
