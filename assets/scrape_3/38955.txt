How many tsunamis have been caused by meteorites falling?

I don't know if this is a better fit for Earth Science (because of the tsunami part) or for Astronomy (because of the meteorite part).
The Wikipedia page on tsunamis says that tsunamis can be caused the the fall of a meteorite. The first reference after that claim mentions that tsunamis can be caused by meteorites, but in an unsubstantiated way. The second reference is behind a paywall so I can't access it.
