Where do asteroids impact upon the Earth most often?
Are impact zones primarily along the equator?
Is there an average area where impacts are more likely to occur?
If there is a zone, is there a way to determine if it's changed? More to the point, if there is an impact zone, are there any similar areas that might indicate the zone has shifted?
