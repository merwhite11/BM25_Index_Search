How does a planet-sized robot standing on a planet affect its gravity?

I originally asked this at the sci-fi exchange but was told it was off-topic as it was about real-world science.
Here is a picture of Unicron standing on top of the planet Cybertron, as written by Simon Furman and drawn by Geoff Senior in issue #75 of the Transformers comic.
Notice how Unicron is pretty much as tall of the planet's diameter. Assuming he was able to land there without causing the entire planet and himself to explode, wouldn't this have affected the planet's gravitational forces and possibly thrown it off its orbit?
