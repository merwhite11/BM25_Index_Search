Objects entering or leaving the observable universe

Have there been any observations of objects entering or leaving the observable universe?
When looking at the physical limit of observing something like this I will to assume that the "object" would be an galaxy. I think it would be a good assumption to choose the size of such an galaxy, $G$, to be in the order of $10^{5}$ light years and the radius of the observable universe, $OU$, is $46 \times 10^{9}$ light years. Using the limit of angular resolution and the fact that the current biggest telescope has a diameter of 22.8 meters, then the longest wave length which would still yield would be about $40 \mu m$. When reversing the redshift, assuming this would be around $z=9$, then the longest emitted wave length which would be detected would be $4 \mu m$.
So observing such an event would technically be possible, however relative to the astronomical timescale we have only been able to observe with such a high resolution for a very short time, so the probability will not be very high.
And if such an event would be observed, would such an object suddenly appear/disappear. It will take along time for an entire galaxy due it size, so this would translate to more of a fade. Or will something else happen?
