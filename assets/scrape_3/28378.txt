How active was the Milky Way in its first 5 billion years?

When I look into the history of the Milky Way, it seems like the Milky Way has been the pinnacle of stability. It seems highly likely that our galaxy has eaten several smaller galaxies/dwarf galaxies in the past. Also, our galaxy seems to be one of the first to form. I am wondering if our seeming stability is the result of our galaxy's age. So, was the Milky Way more active (as far as stellar formation, supernovae, etc.) in its early years? How do we/ could we know?
