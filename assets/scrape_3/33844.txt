Is it possible to see mercury transit "clearly" by the naked eye?

I don't have a telescope but I'm interested in seeing events like eclipses and transits. 
I'll use the atmosphere as my big natural lens. So I'll watch the upcoming mercury transit at the sunset time where the sun looks bigger than usual. Will this make the black dot of mercury bigger or big enough to be obviously seen by the naked eye? I've never seen it before.
