Can I have a career in observational astronomy if I study astrophysics or does it have to be particularly astronomy?

So I'm in year 11 and have an aspiration to be an observational astronomer but I'm worried that if I study astrophysics I won't be able to be an astronomer in particular. It probably sounds like a really dumb question. I am open to doing any job in astronomy/astrophysics but I just need to know. Thanks :)
