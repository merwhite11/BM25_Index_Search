Why in my area does NEOWISE appear so dim and small?

So, I was always amazed by images of NEOWISE around the Internet like this:

Or this:

Yet, all my efforts to see it or photograph it in its full glory were fruitless...

Here you can barely see it at the bottom-left of the image...

Here is the zoomed version... Very very blurry. The point is that I couldn't even see it with my "naked eye" (well I couldn't see it even if it were much brighter, because I use glasses, and that's automatically not "naked eye", but yea). The maximum that I could see was just some smudge. With 5x binoculars I could see it, again super dim and blurry. I decided to purchase a telescope specially for this, and although I could see Jupiter's moons and Saturn's ring quite clearly, I had no success with NEOWISE. Both at 56x and 140x zoom the comet seemed super blurry and dim. Although stars around it were in good focus, no matter how I tried to focus the comet itself, it always seemed out of focus...
BTW, these 2 shots were taken at the closest approach to Earth around 2
So I thought, maybe it's because of light pollution? I live in a not-super-giant city, but a light pollution map showed some amount of pollution still. So I went to a light grey area (only one step brighter than black) on the map. This, however didn't change much at all...

The comet is still very dim and small. I couldn't find it with the "naked eye" reliably. Its size is almost the same as surrounding stars, yet on other people's photos it appears like 10 times bigger than the stars around it!
What could be the reason for this? If not light pollution, maybe it's that my location is very bad for viewing it? I'm located in southern Ukraine, Kherson city.
