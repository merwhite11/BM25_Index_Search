antimatter annihilation in stars

Electrons annihilate with positrons produced through fusion processes in stars. Which particle interaction produces new electrons so that the sun isn't deplete of electrons? Or is something else happening altogether?
Regular fusion cycles in stars produce neutrinos and positrons as by products. Those positrons annihilate with electrons that are already there in the plasma of the star to produce the light that we eventually see. How are those electrons replaced?
