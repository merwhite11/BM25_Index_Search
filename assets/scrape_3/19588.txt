Orange star like ight

Tonight high up in the night sky, it was 8.20 precisely, I saw a bright orange light floating slowly across the sky ,occasionally slowing as if looking for something and flickering, it was too high up and far away to see an exact shape, but it looked like a star, so was it a star, do we have bright orange stars
