What is the acceleration of the stars' speed in the Universe? Positive or negative?

I have read quite different opinions about that, so can someone tell me what is the sign of the acceleration of the stars in the Universe if we accept that the center of the Universe is the beginning of the coordinate system? At least what is considered as correct finally :)
