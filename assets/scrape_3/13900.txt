What exactly is meant by "expanding universe"?

What exactly is meant when we say the universe is expanding? I understand stars and galaxies are getting farther and farther away from us, but are individual particles (atoms, molecules, anything found on Earth, etc.) drifting away from each other as well? If no, then why not? If yes, then shouldn't it, at some point, get to a point when particles can no longer bond with each other?
