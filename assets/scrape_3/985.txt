What do we know about the lifecycle of the Milky Way (or any other spiral galaxy)?

I know that the Milky Way will collide with Andromeda in the distant future but my knowledge about the lifecycle of a galaxy is very lacking. 
I was surprised that Wikipedia is so sparse on information in this topic. So how can I visualize its lifecycle? What will happen in the future?
FYI: I just found this very informative video on the topic.
