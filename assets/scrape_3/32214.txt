If fusion only happens near the center of the sun, what's with all the "fire" on the surface?

I understand that it isn't "fire" in the combustion of oxygen sense, but I can't find an answer online about what we're witnessing happening at the visible surface of the sun if all actual fusion explosive stuff is occurring near the center.
Would love a primer or a link to an explanation.
