Mini black holes, a possible result of the LHC experiment at CERN

A scientist at CERN LHC (Large Hadron Collider) was asked during an interview about the possible results and consequences of operating the LHC at full power of collision in the near future, one of the results he literally said :

One of the theories that predicts the consequences of operating the LHC at full power collision is that mini black holes might form, but do not be afraid of those black holes, they will not start expanding and destroy the earth, they will instantaneously disappear.

I know that black holes create disturbance in space-time. And they actually appear when matter massively gets pressurized into a small size of volume in space which causes gravity to increase insanely which in turn initialize a black hole that even light its self can not escape away from.
So how can a mini black hole disappear anyway?
What in the world would cause a small size, a mini size, a tiny little black hole to vanish or disappear?
