Solar Analemma - but with a star instead

We (homeschool students and I) are trying to find the answer to this question.  Does a star also create Solar Analemma figure 8 when photographed daily for a year?
Has anyone published an experiment where the same star is photographed every night at the same time?
We tried answering this ourselves by googling it, but only come up with websites mentioning the sun.   Is this because it is only possible with the sun?
