Why doesn't the moon always follow the same path? Or why aren't the moon's apoapsis and periapsis fixed?

I have seen many times that the moon doesn't follow the same path. Sometimes the moon gets very close to earth which is shown in the news. If the periapsis of the moon is soo close then why doesn't a super moon occur every 27 days? And if the moon is inclined at 5.1Â° so how can more than 2 eclipses occur in one year?
