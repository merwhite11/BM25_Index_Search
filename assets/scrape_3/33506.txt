A question related to black holes

Not a physicist just a simple guy, don't know much about physics as well. Just like to read things. I was reading about black holes and a question popped in my mind. 
If I understand it correctly then the black hole is created by collapse of a super massive star at the end of its life. This star will have a finite mass. Then what leads to the black hole to have such massive gravity so that nothing can escape it (because if it was a star before with a finite mass then it would also have some finite gravity, right)?  
And then they start absorbing more and more matter. So they grow bigger and bigger. Do black holes die? 
Do all galaxies have a black hole at their center?
Thanks & Regards
