What EM spectrum can stars be most cheaply observed using Remote Sensing during the day?

I would like to augment my GPS navigation with remote sensing of 'the sky.'  I am looking for any astronomical body that can be perceived during the day.
Maybe Pulsars emit something easily detected, seems IR is obvious..  
Any input is appreciated.
