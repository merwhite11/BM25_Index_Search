Sun from SuperNova

I have read that our sun was created from older star(s) which had exploded in a supernova.
If all the matter is travelling away from the central point of explosion, how does it coalesce back into a nebula and then form a sun?  Wouldn't all the matter just keep moving further and further apart?  Wouldn't gravity be far too weak to bring it all back together into one place?
