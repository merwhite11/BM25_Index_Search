(Thought Question) What would a giant far away mirror look like to a telescope?

If there was a theoretically perfect mirror the size of say, our solar system, somewhere out in space that had a focal point of literally earth. What would that look like to a space or earth telescope? Could it be distinguished from other parts of space? Could you identify earth in it? (A la By putting a mirror in space, would we be able to see into the past?)
