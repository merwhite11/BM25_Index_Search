Why does matter spiral into blackholes?

Narrators of astrophysics documentaries constantly state that matter spirals into black holes as if it were intuitive that this would happen because of gravity. But the moon isn't spiralling into the earth. Newtonian physics suggest that an object would either fall past the event horizon in less than half a revolution, or it would orbit indefinitely until acted upon by a third party.
Why would an orbit gradually degrade?
