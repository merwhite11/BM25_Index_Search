Saw moving stars in the sky

So I was out with my friends at a bonfire and we decided to sit down and star gaze, my other friend pointed out a star that looked to be moving and we all followed it with our eyes and t was smaller than the other stars and would disappear for a second and then come back but not blinking. And once it went out of view another one would appear again and just go opposite directions in kind of a circular path not a straight one and they were really fast too. This was like by the Big Dipper btw super confused is there like something that moved in our space that does that, a satellite wouldâ€™ve gone in a non crazy direction right? And not so many of them..
