Opposite Constellation of Sagittarius A*

Suppose an alien race fired a laser beam from the centre of the Milky Way, it went through the Sun and then off further out of the galaxy.  What Constellation would the light beam head towards, closest star also if possible?  Am not interested about how much devastation the light beam may or may not cause, just the journey and destination.  
Would that direction be the quickest/shortest way out of the galaxy if we had a spaceship that could travel that fast?
