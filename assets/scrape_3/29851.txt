Super conductivity of black holes

We all know that we cannot see black holes due to its strong gravitational force. But I think gravity is not the cause for invisibility of black holes. The temperature of a black hole is  1.4Ã—10-14. At these low temperature any body can act as super conductor due to Meissner effect. So that's why we are not seeing black holes due to this effect. Can it be possible?
