Question about the formation of elements

So, elements such as iron, gold, etc. are formed from different types of supernovas, whether it's type 1A or 2. My question is, is it possible that there are elements that are formed that we never received during the formation of Earth and that we are unaware of? Or have we discovered every non man-made element?
