Create an inhabited black hole

Hello I was watching one of Isaac Arthur's videos about the end of time and i just got a crazy idea
Is it theoretically possible to "create" a "solar system" that would look like a supermasive black hole to ouside observers , but inside would be normal-ish, by plasing the most massive star in the universe at the center, then thousands or milions of main sequence stars orbiting it with 2 or more stars (at L points) on the same orbit?
Would you be able to get the mass high enough that the inner "solar system" would look like a black hole from the outside if you ignore problems with orbital stability and heat of such system?
My guess is no, but thought i'd ask 
Thanks
