Advancement of perihelion, data

I was looking for accurate and up-to-date data regarding the advancement of the perihelion of the planets in the Solar System, the only ones I've found so far are at least 90 years old bout I really doubt that no progress has been made so far in this field... does anyone know where to find newer ones?
In addition to this, can anybody make an estimation about the difference between the Moon-Earth system precession around the Sun and a Moonless Earth system? It should be very small, too small to be detected maybe...
Thank you in advance!
