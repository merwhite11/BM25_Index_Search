Astrophysics of Supernovae - Energy over Distance?

I need this for worldbuilding, but it is a physics question. I want to be able calculate the energy over distance from a hypernova of a variable star like Eta Carinae. Understanding what energy levels would be dangerous to a planet, and dangerous on what level, would also be necessary.
Scientists have numbers saying that a normal supernova would damage Earth from within 50 to 100 light years. I'm more interested in hypernovae, because Eta Carinae is 7500 light years from Earth, and some scientists are saying it could strip our ozone layer literally any minute, day, year, or century now. I have to wonder: if it might be that bad here, how bad is it 5000 light years or 1000 light years away?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae#Possible_effects_on_Earth 
I know we have models to predict these, but after repeated attempts at searching I cannot find them, and maybe I just don't know the correct terms to search. I like this answer to a similar question: https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/a/19002 but it appears to be about planets orbiting the dying star having a normal supernova.
I'd like to be able to take the characteristics of the star and create a distance spectrum that goes from planetary evaporation to an aurora light show for a wide range of planets: rocky, Neptunian, or Jovian . Being able to estimate that of any star would be a bonus, but I mostly just want to be able to do massive variable stars.
