Is T Tauri a compulsory stage for stellar evolution?

Do all stars go from Protostar stage to T Tauri and then to Main Sequence or is T-Tauri stage only for certain stars?  If only certain stars, is that those that are less than 3 solar masses which i see mentioned?  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Tauri_star)
