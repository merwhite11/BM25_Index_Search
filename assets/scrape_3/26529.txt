Does the CMB pattern evolve in a human lifetime?

I was thinking, as CMB is a snapshot of a slice of the Universe during recombination, how much the cmb is changing with time ?
I mean as we progress in time we look a CMB a bit more faraway each time, could this effect be seen and could we watch the pattern of CMB anisotropies changing with time (on a "human" timescale I mean) ?
