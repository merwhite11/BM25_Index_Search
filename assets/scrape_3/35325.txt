Is it only possible to look at solar systems with stars at least as old as ours to be able to find intelligent life?

Assuming the speed it takes to development intelligent life is the same in all solar systems, would we need to look at exoplanets with stars as old or older than ours to find intelligent life? A young star would be assumed to have been surrounded by planets that are relatively new and havenâ€™t had time to develop intelligent life. Visiting those planets with young stars relative to the sun would most likely only give us planets with prehistoric life.
