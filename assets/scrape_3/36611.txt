How large were the deviations of Uranus's positon from predicted which led to the discovery of Neptune?

After Uranus was discovered and its orbit calculated, its future orbit was calculated, and its future positions as seen from Earth were calculated.
And observers of Uranus began to notice that Uranus was deviating from its calculated positions.  Eventually the possibility that an undiscovered planet was perturbing the orbit of Uranus was used by Adams and Le Verrier to calculate the orbit of Neptune and led to the discovery of Neptune.
So how large were the deviations in the apparent position of Uranus that were used to calculate the orbit and apparent position of Neptune?
