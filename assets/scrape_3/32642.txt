How can we estimate if a certain astronomical object will be visible from a place on earth?

If we have the RA/DEC of an object that we want to observe, how can we tell if that object is visible from our place on earth (at a particular time of the year)?
Given that the part of the sky we are observing is changing throughout the year, it seems fairly complicated.
