Tracing back OMNI data to the sun

I have been reading the OMNIWeb data documentation in order to clarify one particular question without success. I need to associate each measurement in the OMNI dataset to a moment in time at the sun (at least to narrow it to a time interval). Therefore, I need to understand how long it takes for the solar wind to get from the sun to the point where it is measured. I understand that the solar wind velocity is variable, so this time interval is constantly changing.
Could you please help me understand this question? Can the solar wind measurements be used to trace back into the moment at which it left the sun? I would be very grateful if you could explain or point me to some sufficient references.
