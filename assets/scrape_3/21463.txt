How much light would be reflected from Jupiter to Europa (in Europas night)?

Suppose Europa is found habitable and humans start living on it. Europa is close to Jupiter and during the night Jupiter would be reflecting light to Europa, just like our full moon reflects light to earth. Our moon is small compared to Jupiter. Would humans still need artificial light during Europas nights?
