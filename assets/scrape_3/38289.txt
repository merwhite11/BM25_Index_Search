If the Sun disappears right now, when the absence of its gravity affects on Earth?

Imagine if the Sun disappears right now. When the Earth will be affected by its absence? Does it affect immediately, or it takes almost 8 minutes? (The time that light travels from the Sun to the Earth.)
So if I ask this question in another way, the changes in Space-Time will affect immediately or it will travel by light speed?
