Why different specifications for telescopes and binoculars?

Sorry for the noob question but I don't seem to be able to find the answer on the internet.
I've been looking through some telescopes and binoculars and noticed that shops typically give different specifications for the two groups. For example, for telescopes I'll often see focal length, aperture ratio, or limit value, but I haven't seen any of those for binoculars; for binoculars, on the other hand, they'll mention exit pupil, field of view, or glass material, none of which I've seen given for a telescope. Why is that? Are the two devices so different as to be incomparable?
