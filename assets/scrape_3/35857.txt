How many degrees does the sidereal month orbit?

It's written everywhere that anomalistic month orbits 360 degrees completely, then how many degrees does the sidereal month orbit?  
Here is written that the sidereal month orbits 360 degrees too, but it doesn't make sense that they have the same orbit degrees since the anomalistic month is longer.
According to my logic, if 360 degrees equal to 27.55455 days, then 27.321661 days (=sidereal month) equal to 356.9 degrees, rather than 360 degrees. Is it correct?
