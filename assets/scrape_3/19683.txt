Why does the traslation movement of the earth last the same time as the four seasons?

Why does the traslation movement of the earth last the same time as the four seasons? The seasons could take 100 days or 200 or 20 years (aprox. like in GoT)... but exactly (exactly???) 1 year. Why?
Edit: I think that I need to redefine the question.
I define a year as the full traslation movement of the earth around the sun.
And the four seasons as the full movement of the perpendicular axis from 0 to 23.5 to 0 again to -23.5 to 0 again.
Why do these two movements take the same time?
