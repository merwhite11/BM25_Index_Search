Are there any known low-inclination trans-Neptunian objects?

All the trans-Neptunian object's orbits I know are very inclined compared to those of the eight recognized planets, and Centaur's orbits are highly inclined as well.
Are there any known Centaurs and/or trans-Neptunian objects or TNOs whose orbit isn't significantly inclined to the ecliptic or to the invariable plane, but is on about the same plane as the eight main planets?
And to double check, the hypothetical planet Nine also has a high orbital inclination, doesn't it?
