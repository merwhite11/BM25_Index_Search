Betelgeuse and sun classification

In this video, between 4 and 6 minutes, the lecturer describes M type stars as being less massive, smaller, and redder than G type stars.
He then gives Betelgeuse as an example of an M type star and mentions that the sun is a G type star.
However, Betelgeuse is more massive than our sun, and larger than our sun.
How can I reconcile these facts?
