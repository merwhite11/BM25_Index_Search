How many Supernovae have been Imaged in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field?

The Hubble Ultra-Deep Field is an image showing about 10.000 galaxies:

Consider Victor Buso's spectacular discovery of an early supernova in NGC 613 (named SN 2016gkg):

This got me wondering about how many supernovae the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field may contain without us knowing because we would need a light curve or reference image to identify one with certainty. Some supernovae also would be only a pixel or less and impossible to identify.
Is it possible to calculate a meaningful lower bound?
