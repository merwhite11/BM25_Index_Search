Occurrence of Venusian transits

As transits of Venus come in pairs, each separated by 8 years, wouldn't that imply an accurate ratio between Earth's and Venus' revolution period? I've found the ratio to be about 0.681. I presume one could see a resonance of 2/3 in that number, but as other resonances in our solar system as for example Thethys and Enceladus (4:3) are far more accurate, could it be "just" coincidental? And if so, why the regularity in the transits?
