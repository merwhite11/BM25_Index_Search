Could there be additional Neptunian satellites between Larissa and Hippocamp?

Plotting the moons of Neptune in terms of semimajor axis and eccentricity using the values given on the Wikipedia page for the moons of Neptune, there appears to be a fairly large gap between the orbits of Larissa and the newly-named satellite Hippocamp.

Are there stable orbits within the gap, and are there likely to be additional moons there?
