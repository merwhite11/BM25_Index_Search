Are astronomers waiting to see something in an image from a gravitational lens that they've already seen in an adjacent image?

@RobJeffries' answer to the question Does gravitational lensing provide time evolution information? points out that there can be a substantial different in arrival times of light from a given source seen in different images from a gravitational lens.
The linked paper there shows "$\Delta t$" values of the order of 30 days, but it is hard for me to understand what the actual observable is.
What I'm asking for here is (ideally) if there is a well defined event that a lay person could understand, something blinking or disappearing or brightening substantially that has already been seen in one image produced by a gravitational lens that has not yet been seen in one of the other images, and is expected to be seen in the (presumably near) future.
If something like this does not exist, a substitute could be a case where this has happened, and the second sighting of the same event was predicted, waited for, and observed on time.
I have no idea if this happens all the time, or has never happened yet.
