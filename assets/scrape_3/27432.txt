Can the Moon eclipse Venus?

The title basically says it all. As seen from the Earth, is it possible for the Moon to eclipse Venus (or any other planet) or are the orbits inclined such that this never happens?
If such an eclipse is possible, is it a frequent or infrequent event? How would I find out when the next one occurs?
