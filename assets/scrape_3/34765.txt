Consequences of strong wind on an alien Planet on the possibility of life

I was surprised to learn recently that Neptune has winds of 1500 miles an hour. 
My question is whether life could ever evolve on such a Planet that has such powerful winds? Not necessarily on Neptune of course but on another exoplanet in another Solar System.
