How did pre-Earth's mass and orbit change at the Moon formation event?

The popular, but still disputable, Moon formation theory is that a pre-Earth was hit by a Mars sized planet. The mass ratio of Earth:Mars:Moon is roughly 100:10:1.

Does this mean that pre-Earth was roughly 9 Moon masses (~10%) lighter
than today's Earth? Or could much mass have been ejected from the
Earth-Moon system?
Did the impact substantially and immediately change Earth's orbit,
such as its average distance from the Sun?
Is there a better planet name for "pre-Earth", like there is for
Theia? It was after all another planet than Earth is.
