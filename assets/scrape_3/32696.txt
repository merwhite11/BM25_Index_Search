Speed of Moonrise relative to fixed point on ground

Due to the curvature of the earth, and the way the moon interacts with the atmosphere (especially close to the horizon), is there a known function that describes the speed of the moon relative to its angle in the sky?
For bonus points, imagine that you are at altitude in a plane, and for some reason want to descend at a rate that would keep the total % of the moon illuminated constant. Is there a function for that?
Thank you in advance, this is not for an assignment, just for my own curiosity as I watched moonrise tonight. I have tried googling these questions, to no avail.
