Can we learn anything from observing galaxies edge-on, like the Spindle Galaxy?

I was reading about NGC 5866, sometimes referred to as the Spindle Galaxy. It's notable because of its inclination relative to Earth; we see the disk from the side, rather than face-on. The difference is akin to viewing a person's head in profile, instead of looking at their face from the front.
We do lose some information about the morphology of NGC 5866 because of the unusual orientation, as it's difficult to see any spiral arms, bars, or other structures. That said, I'm wondering whether we can still learn more about the galaxy than if we viewed it face-on. For instance, can we gain information about the density distribution of the galaxy at various distances removed from the galactic plane, or perhaps about the structure of its central bulge (if there is one)?
