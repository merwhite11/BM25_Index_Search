Orbital plane evolution and planet discovery via transit method

I'm aware that our solar system is largely/roughly on a single orbital plane, but haven't other star system's orbital planes been scrambled by billions of years of interaction? 
If so - how much chance is there that an exoplanetary system's orbital plane is inclined favourably enough to witness the dimming of a transiting planet across its sun?
