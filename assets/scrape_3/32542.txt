Sagittarius star cloud?

I was using SkySafari with my phone, but the compass didn't quite work.
So as I knew where the cardinal points were, I think I have shot the Sagittarius star cloud, at least a part of it.
Can you guys tell me if I am wrong? 

It was the 5th of July at 00:10 local time. I was at N 45.61°, E 7.35°.
