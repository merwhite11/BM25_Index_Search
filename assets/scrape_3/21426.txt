Observing the night sky with a 6-year old

We currently possess a Celestron NexStar 130 SLT computerized reflector telescope and have an opportunity to do backyard astronomy with my 6-year old daughter from time to time.
She is quite interested in space and astronomy, knows a lot of objects in the Solar System, which have atmosphere and what don't, knows major planet satellites and thinks there is life on Titan.
But, I find it quite challenging to actually do telescope observations with her:

it takes time to set things up, assemble the equipment and align the telescope. She is not patient enough and that sometimes "kills" all the fun and excitement
it is not easy for her to get used to looking through an eyepiece
it is easy to touch the telescope which leads to a shaking image

What are the general guidelines to observe the night sky with the 6-year old? What can I do to make the process less tedious, more fun and engaging?
