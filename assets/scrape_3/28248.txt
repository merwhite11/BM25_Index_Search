Why does earth's north pole roughly point in the same direction throughout the year?

I know there is a gioscopic explanation but I was under the impression that Earth is traveling in a straight line through space that has been curved by our sun's gravity ,so my question is why doesn't one hemisphere always point away from the sun ? It just seems like a bit of a contradiction that gravity can curve the fabric of space but has no effect on earth's axis...
