First observation that the movement of a planet or asteroid in its orbit was affected by another planet?

Answers to the question How did Kepler determine the orbital period of Mars? describing careful observations centuries ago got me thinking.
Question: What was the first analysis of observations that directly demonstrated that the movement of a planet or asteroid in its orbit was affected by gravitational attraction by another planet?
I don't mean inferences based on the spacing of orbits, I'm thinking of detailed positional measurements; something like planet/asteroid A was X kilometers or Y arcseconds away from it's predicted position and it couldn't be accounted for if not for the gravitational effects of planet B.
I am not sure if First observation that the Sun and Jupiter (and friends) move around a common barycenter? is a completely separate question, or if this confirmation happened all at once, but I've currently asked it separately.
