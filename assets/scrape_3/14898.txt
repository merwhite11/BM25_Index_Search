Why 225088 Gonggong is not a dwarf Planet yet?

Per definition a dwarf planet is:

a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape1, (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite.

The Wikipedia page for 225088 Gonggong, former 2007 OR10 states three possibilities for its dimensions:


1535+75−225 km
1280+210−210 km
1200+300−200 km


Which is all minimum 1000km in diameter. So how can you still doubt the hydrostatic equilibrium for such a large body?
