Seeing a star near zenith around sunset

I'm recalling while taking a university astronomy class the professor brought a few of us up to the observatory, around sunset.  He showed us a star near zenith with the telescope.  After we left the observatory and were walking back to our dorms we thought we saw the same star, with the naked eye.  The sky still seemed somewhat bright.
Is that possible?
