Would LIGO Detect Head-On Collision?

Assume two black holes collide head-on.  In other words, they were not orbiting one another before the collision.  I know this is unlikely.  Further assume that their sizes and distance from Earth are similar to past collisions detected by LIGO.
My understanding is that detectable gravitational waves are caused by massive objects undergoing massive accelerations and that detections so far have been of colliding objects orbiting one another many times within a fraction of a second.
I assume that a head-on collision would create a single gravitational "pulse" instead of a wave.  I don't know if "pulse" is the right word for this.  Would this pulse be detectable by LIGO?
