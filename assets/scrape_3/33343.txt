Would two Earth-like planets on opposite sides of a Sol-like star at about 1 AU be a stable configuration?

Would two Earth-like planets on opposite sides of a Sol-like star at about 1 AU be a relatively stable configuration? I understand that there are tadpole-like orbits and the two planets may not stay exactly opposite each other, but oscillate around those position.
But given perturbations from other planets, say a Jupiter-like one at say 5 AU, might they eventually crash into each other, or would one end up moving to a higher orbit and the other to a lower orbit?
