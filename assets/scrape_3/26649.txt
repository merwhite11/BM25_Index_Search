Generating random galaxy catalogs for correlation functions

The galaxy correlation function, when computed directly from a galaxy catalog, relies on computing a randomly generated counterpart catalog.
When dealing with a simulated galaxy mock-catalog, where the sample of galaxies is roughly uniform over a large box (e.g. the galaxy mocks created from Millennium/Millennium II), the random catalog can be just be a uniform distribution of points in the same volume as the real data.
However, real-world galaxy catalogs are not homogenous boxes, and have very irregular shapes and observationally induced redshift and angular distributions. Even some mock-catalogs are endowed with these properties to better represent real data. In these cases, how is a random catalog best produced? With some sort of probability distribution in coordinates which attempts to mimic the "non-physical" (i.e. not due to observational constraints) part of the distribution? Or a simple binary mask which filters out empty regions, but otherwise leaves the random catalog uniform.
If the answer is that some nonuniform distribution should be used, is there a usual method for doing so? The literature I have found (e.g. for the SDSS published data, and for galaxy mocks mimicking SDSS's constraints) does not discuss this in any way. Note, if this is a highly involved process beyond a brief summary and a source or two, I do not expect a full answer here. Rather, I am trying to determine if there is an existing set of standard methods which are documented but have eluded me thus far.
