If the earth lost 1/81th of its mass how would it orbit change?

If a planet becomes lighter, then I believe its orbit will change.
For example, the moon is 1/81 of the mass of the earth. So, if the moon disappeared, then the earth-moon system would lose 1/81th of its mass. How would the orbit of the earth change in that circumstance?
