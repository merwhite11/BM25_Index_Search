Is the age of the solar system equal to the age of meteorites?

I've read articles that state the age of the solar system has been determined by measuring the amount of decay of isotopes in some meteorite, which has demonstrated that  the lead isotopes in the meteorite have cooled and locked into place some number of years ago.
However, if a yellow sun can not create heavier elements, wouldn't it be correct to say the age of an meteorite dated this way is how long it's been since the asteroid was ejected from a blue or heavier star? The sun may have started burning many years after that.
