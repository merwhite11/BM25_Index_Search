do rockets follow a straight path but is looks curved because of space time?

Does the path of a rocket or anything going straight up look curved because the mass of the earth is curving space-time?
If we assume the earth, the rocket and all the celestial bodies whose gravitational field reaches the earth to be massless then will the rocket follow truly a straight line, because there would be nothing curving the space-time?
