Since when are we able to discover interstellar objects similar to 1I/ʻOumuamua?

Since when are our observation capabilities good enough to discover objects similar to the first discovered interstellar object 1I/ʻOumuamua (October 2017) with high probability?
Could we make rough estimate how frequent are passes of similar objects through the inner Solar System?
What could be the probability that during this century we will be able to gain more observational knowledge about interstellar objects?
