What does half-lit means?



Aristarchus estimated the relative distance of the Sun and Moon by
  observing the angle between the Sun and the Moon (α in the diagram)
  when the Moon is exactly half lit. Angle β must be 90° for the Moon to
  be half lit. By observing the angle α, he could then set the scale of
  the triangle and thus the relative lengths of the sides. (Sizes and
  distances are not to scale.)

Does half-lit mean exactly 45 degrees?
