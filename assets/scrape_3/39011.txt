What would you call death by magnetar?

The magnetic field of a magnetar is so strong that it would stretch people's atoms apart. This, would obviously, result in death. But how spaghettification refers to death by extreme tides, and for the most part, refers to death by black hole, what field-specific term would best refer to death by extreme magnetic fields, eg. from a magnetar?
