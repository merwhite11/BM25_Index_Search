Is Mars expected to go through the tail of Comet Siding?

This question will likely be answered "in retrospect" in about 8 days.  So it's a great opportunity to "lay it out there" and then let reality prove you right/wrong.
On the 19th of October, Comet Siding is expected to pass Mars very closely (1/3 the distance of the moon from Earth). My assumption is that this means its nucleus.  But comet tails can be very long (100s of millions of miles).  For the sake of this questions let's keep it to "obviously observable" tail and coma.  
Additionally "going through" may need a definition.  So let's say that if a line drawn from the outer (obviously observable) coma closest to Mars and the end of the (obviously observable) tail were to intersect with-in 20 miles of the surface of Mars, then we would say that Mars has "gone through the tail" of the comet.
So is Mars expected (or even more fun, do YOU expect Mars) to go through the tail of Comet Siding on the 19th of October?
If so, what will be observable from the surface of Mars? Large number of shooting stars?  
NASA is preparing to hide its satellites (repositioning them to the "far side" of Mars)  from comet dust traveling at 35 miles/sec.    Is there any idea of how long the encounter will last?
