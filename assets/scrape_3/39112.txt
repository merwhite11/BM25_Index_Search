Considering that the moon’s gravitational pull on earth is so weak- we need special instruments to detect it- how does it cause the tides?

That the moon’s gravitational pull is responsible for the tides is established. However, if we want to detect the moon’s gravitational pull on earth, this is very challenging. This seems to be a paradox considering the enormous force needed to drive the tide.
