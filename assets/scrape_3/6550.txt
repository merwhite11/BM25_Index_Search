What scientific evidence is there to support or refute the Iron Sun Hypothesis?

Professor Oliver Manuel,  a professor of nuclear chemistry at the University of Missouri-Rolla, claims in the article Sun Is Made Of Iron, Not Hydrogen, Professor Says that

iron, not hydrogen, is the sun's most abundant element.

Specifically, he and his colleagues postulate that

"We think that the solar system came from a single star, and the sun formed on a collapsed supernova core," Manuel says. "The inner planets are made mostly of matter produced in the inner part of that star, and the outer planets of material form the outer layers of that star."

Is there evidence to support or refute Professor Manuel's theories?
