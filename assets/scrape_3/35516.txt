Tongue-in-cheek quote on dust extinction

I remember hearing a quote or maybe rather an anecdote about a famous astronomer but I can't recall the exact wording and I also forgot who allegedly said it. Unfortunately, that has thwarted all my googling attempts.
It goes like this:
The retired astronomer gets asked by a journalist if he would do it all again and he replies something along the lines of:

Only if selective to total extinction were constant.

Is this something that really happened? If so, who said it and what is the exact wording?
Please also provide a source if possible.
