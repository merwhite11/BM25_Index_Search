Different full moon face on different places on Earth same time

I have theoretical question.
Let's assume that it is full moon and two different humans are looking at it at the same time. One human is for example in London and one in Beijing. It doesn't really matter where exactly, important is that they are almost on opposite side of Earth but they both see the moon at the same time.
I assume they see the moon from different angle. Is it possible that one of them see different part of the moon because of this angle. It could be just the border, tiny part.
Could you please tell me, how big is this tiny part of the moon which one see and the other don't? Few meters? Kilometers?
Thanks everyone for help.
