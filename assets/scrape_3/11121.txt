Does a week represent something in astronomy?

I know that a day represent the time for the earth to make a full rotation around its own axis and a year is the time for the earth to make a full rotation around the sun.
But does a week represent something? And a month?
Thank you.
ps: Not sure what tags I need to use, feel free to add/remove them
