Why does the neutral hydrogen velocity have this characteristic behavior in the galactic plane?

The recently released map of galactic neutral hydrogen density and velocity is really beautiful. The work has been relased by the HI4PI collaboration (HI = neutral hydrogen, $4\pi$ = complete spherical coverage).
My question is fairly simple. Looking at the image near the galactic plane, why do I see near the center a green bump on the left and a blue bump on the right, then near the edges of the image a much stronger blue bump on the left and a green bump on the right. In other words, there is a major and a minor peak in the positive radial velocity gas, and a major and a minor peak in the negative radial velocity gas. 
Does this have some simple geometrical explanation?

above: for those who can not distinguish the green and blue in the image, this plots the average green (solid) and blue (dashed) intensity within the central equatorial band.
There is a nice article at phys.org with a video, which can also be seen in YouTube. It shows the intensity of HI as a cut in radial velocity is slowly scanned through the data set.
