How does a neutron star emitting magnetic-dipole radiation lose angular momentum?

Is the ultimate reason that the neutron star loses angular momentum that the magnetic-dipole radiation is not spherically symmetric and photons have momentum?
Just for the loss of angular momentum, particles emitted from the neutron star surface are not necessary, right?
