Apparent Ring of Craters on the Moon

I saw this picture on the BBC news website.

There appears to be a ring of craters in the center of the picture, aligned in an approximate sub vertical orientation.
Am I just seeing things or does this apparent ring of craters a feature and does it extend to the far side of the moon? If it does exist, what form of bombardment or gravitational attraction would have create such a ring?
