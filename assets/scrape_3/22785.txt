Saturn observation : how to calculate requirements for Parallax method

In September, Saturn is 9.9au away from Earth. If we use the parallax method, what should be the base line between the two people?
So I know that $D = B / \theta$, but how do I find out theta? I'm pretty sure the answer is pretty obvious, but my mind really is not working right now, so any help is appreciated
Thank you in advance.
