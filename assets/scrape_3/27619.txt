What is the difference between wind, jet and outflow?

For jets, I found a pdf file here

Jet: collimated beam of matter of high velocity
sources: young stars, active galactic nuclei, $\mu$-quasars, gamma­ ray bursts, planetary nebulae, pulsars
jet sources host accretion disks

How about winds and outflows? Can somebody make some clarifications for the three concepts， their correlation and difference?
