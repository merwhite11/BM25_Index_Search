How to chose a comfortable 2 inch eyepiece for a Skywatcher Dobsonian 150 mm f/8 reflector?

Totally newbie here. I got the Skywatcher Dobsonian 6 inch (150 mm) f/8 Newtonian reflector. I had a brief chance to test it yesterday when the skies here in Melbourne cleared a little bit. I was able to see the Moon that was not that high in the sky.
With the telescope, it came with two 1.25" eyepieces; 10 mm and 25 mm, and a 2" adapter. 
I found out the best view with the 25 mm although it wasn't that clear. I still have to check the mirrors alignment and collimate.
However, I found a bit uncomfortable to use it though. It was hard to keep the entire view clear. If I moved slightly I couldn't see the entire view.
After reading some articles, it seem that a 2" eyepiece offer a more comfortable view experience.
I'd like to ask; how can I choose a 2" eyepiece that would be more comfortable for observing the Moon and planets? What should I look for in terms of types or specifications?
