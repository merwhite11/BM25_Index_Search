Software for simulating a night sky

Not sure if this is the right StackExchange for this, but seems appropriate.
Is there any off-the-shelf software that can display a star field (view of the night sky) as if seen from a particular location and looking in a particular direction?  Ideally, I'd like to be able to specify the location (Lat/Lon coordinates) and the direction in which the virtual camera is pointing, and get an image of the starfield.
The ability to modify the parameters of the virtual camera would be of additional benefit.
Free software would be best, but paid may be ok as well, depending on the price.
