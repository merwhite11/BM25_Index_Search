What is the significance of the asteroid belt?

This may seem like a trivia question or a question for skeptics, but I really would like to know, what is the significance of the asteroid belt? The only reason I've seen from my research is "because it's there", but I'd like to know a more scientific reason. Evolutionists state the reason is "because the Belt will give us more clues to the formation of the Solar System"; but I don't buy into that theory. Some dreamers say that asteroids may one day be mined for precious minerals; but this is only a far-off dream.
Theses three reasons given are all unsatisfactory; could a professional or knowledgeable amateur astronomer help me out here?
