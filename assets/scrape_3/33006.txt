Could anything consume a small black hole?

Whenever I read about black holes, it is normally involving how they devour anything that comes too close... regardless of how big anything is.
But what if it were a really small black hole vs something really large? How about something like a large star or neutron star... could a black hole be small enough to get devoured / consumed by something like that or would it just not be possible?
