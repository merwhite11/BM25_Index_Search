How has the Earth's orbit changed over hundreds of millions or billion of years?

First, I know that modeling orbital mechanics of 8 planets is hard, but there are some theories out there, for example, Jupiter is thought to have moved in towards the sun then started moving away.   Article
and Uranus and Neptune may have switched spots Article
Is there any pretty good evidence on how the Earth's orbit has changed over time.   I remember reading some geological evidence that a year used to be longer, implying that the Earth used to be farther form the Sun, but I've since been unable to find that article, and for purposes of this question, lets count a day as 24 hours even though a day used to be quite a bit shorter hundreds of millions or billions of years ago.   - footnote, I've still not been able to find that article but it occurs to me, it could have been counting shorter days, not longer years - so, take that part with a grain of salt.
Are there any good studies out there on how many 24 hour days were in a year, 100, 300, 500, 800 million years ago?  or 1 or 2 billion years ago?  Either geological or orbital modeling?   Preferably something a layman can read, not something written by and for PHDs?
Or any good summaries, also encouraged.    Thanks.
I also found this article, but it seems more theoretical than evidence based.   http://www.futurity.org/did-orbit-mishap-save-earth-from-freezing/
