2D Distorted Star Map for Pasting on Sphere Surface

Are there printable 2D star maps that are distorted such that, when printed, they can be cut (along printed lines) to be applied to the outside of a sphere to represent the celestial sphere, as seen from the center of the substrate sphere?
Is there a term for this type of map?
If they don't exist, how can one be created?
