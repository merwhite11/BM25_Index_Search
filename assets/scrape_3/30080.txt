How is this the last supermoon of 2019?

Media coverage of the "super worm equinox moon" (*eyeroll*) has stated that this is the last supermoon of 2019.  Since supermoons normally happen every three or four months, how can there be big gaps?
It feels like phenomena like supermoons, which are basically due to the relative phase of orbits, shouldn't have sharp transitions like this.
