How far into the future can we go by traveling close to a black hole?

If we sent someone on a path that passed as near as possible to a black hole without getting pulled in, how far into the future would they go due to time dilation?  Let's assume the black hole is 5 solar masses (I am assuming the mass will affect the calculation).  I would like to know from two considerations:

An observer that can survive anything (e.g. ideal case)
The forces that a human can tolerate (e.g. a human would not be able to get as close to a black hole as would be ideal)
