Is it true that we see the center of the milky-way for only half of the year?

I'm not an astronomer, please excuse my non-formal language.
Since we are located in one of the arms of the Milky way, the center of the galaxy should be in one direction from our location, while in the other direction, we stare into the "other side".
So at nights as we are in the orbit area that is between the sun and the center of the galaxy we are able to see the center (the "milky-way"), while when in the other side of the orbit, at nights, we are not able to see it.
Does this mean we only see the milky way (meaning the milky-way's famous pattern) half of the year?
In the below diagram, the small circle is our year-orbit around our sun. Red dot is the earth location on day 0 of the year and the green dot is the earth location on day 180th of the year.
I know that as we are orbiting our sun, it also orbits the galaxy, but since it is so slow, it is negligible for this questions.

Is this reasonable?
I mean, if we look at the sky, we will see the center of the galaxy only during half of the year?
