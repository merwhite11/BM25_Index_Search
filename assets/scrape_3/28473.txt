Why don't we see purple stars

I know that we don't see green stars because in blackbody radiation star doesn't produce one spectrum.
The stars that have peaks in the green spectrum produce other spectrum in nearly same amout. This make them appear white.
If stars have peaks in the infrarad spectrum that has wavelength little longer than red.
We see those stars red because they produce red spectrum more than other visible spectrum.
But if stars have peaks in the ultraviolet spectrum that has wavelength little shorter than violet. Why don't we see those stars purple ?
