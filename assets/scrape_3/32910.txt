Lorentz transformation for stars

If a star that has regular pulses(standard candle) is flying away from us at relativistic velocity(very distant), would that pulses look like very sluggish compared to a non-relativistic velocity(close to earth)...something like a clock ticking in a relativistic spaceship and....... ofcourse red-shifted.Thanks.
