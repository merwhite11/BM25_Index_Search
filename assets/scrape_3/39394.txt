Is extra-planetary phosphine actually a new discovery?

For all the buzz on Venus’s phosphine, I’m curious as to what sets it apart from the findings of phosphine on Jupiter,  Titan, etc.  There are several papers on NASA.gov dating to 1979 and more recent on the subject.   Per request in comments:  https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/annual-reports/2010/jpl-titan/the-commonality-of-life-in-the-universe/index.html
Why is this latest finding of Venusian phosphine a special case?
