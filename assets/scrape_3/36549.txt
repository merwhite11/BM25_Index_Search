Are there other planetary systems where gas giants are on the inside to rocky planet orbits?

I understand that formation theories for gas giants suggest they should be born further away where there is more gas for them to monopolize vs the sun, and then to form Hot Jupiters they need to migrate inwards, which would disrupt the orbits of rocky planets.
Are there any quibbles with this? Out of all the extrasolar systems is there even one where you have hot or warm gas giants and then cold Earth or Super-Earth sized terrestrials? Bodies like we have in the Kuiper belt lie beyond our gas giants but they are mostly made of ices and represent a small leftover fraction of the system mass, so they don't really count here.
