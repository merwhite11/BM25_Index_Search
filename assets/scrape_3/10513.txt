What are the most popular computer programming languages in observational astronomy?

I would like to work in the field of observational astronomy (not so much theoretical astronomy).
I currently know two computer programming languages: C# and MATLAB.
I have read that computer programming is absolutely essential to every astronomer, and that it takes a very significant part of the time of the work of most astronomers.
Therefore I would like to learn a few more programming languages. Hence my question:
What are the most common programming languages in observational astronomy?
