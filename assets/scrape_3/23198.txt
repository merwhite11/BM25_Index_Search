Do mixed type remnant collisions produce anything interesting?

The recent detection of a binary neutron star inspiraling and colliding raises an interesting question in my mind. Type Ia supernovae are believed to be caused by white dwarf/regular star pairs and/or white dwarf pairs. Short gamma ray bursts are now known to be produced by neutron star/neutron star collisions. Black hole/black hole collisions haven't produced any verifiably detected electromagnetic radiation. What about some of the other mixed type collissions? Especially white dwarf/neutron star or neutron star/black hole?
My understanding is that stellar binaries tend to have similar mass, so mixed type remnants will likely be rather rare. Hence, why I didn't ask about white dwarf/black hole binaries. Even so, I'm curious how the large difference in density would affect things. Especially if a neutron star would be tidally shredded into an accretion disk by a black hole before they can collide, making a relatively slow event, or will the process be more rapid and violent, akin to the events we've seen so far?
