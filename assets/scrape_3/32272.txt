Struggling to understand the phases of the moon

 Source
Typically this diagram is how the phases of the moon are explained but the issue is this, namely, the phases seen on the right half are not possible. All the phases should appear on the left half during the night when the moon is typically most visible. 
So how on earth are the phases even generated? 
The most remarkable phases are waning moon phases because the moon is lit up on the face away from the sun light source. 
What am I missing? 
Iâ€™ve edited the question by adding two additional photos showing the progression of the moon in the night sky over the course of a given time interval and several days, as well as a synodic month which would hopefully indicate based on the position of the moon the sequence of days and based on the height the time of day/night.

Here is a link to the explanation of how she generated her photo and over what time span but you must have a Facebook account to read it. It is easier to follow the Italian than the English but both are available
