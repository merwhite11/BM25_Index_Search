What effect does Earth losing a part of its mass have, is there an impact on the Earth's orbit around the Sun?

This is a random question that popped into my mind. I'm not a physicist or astronomist, however, I am genuinely curious. Also, this is not intended as a science fiction question, but an actual science question.
I had doubts about where this question should be posted - the Astronomy or the Physics SE page, in the end, I decided to post it here.
Sub-questions that I have, all being closely related to the one in the title:

Do the liftoffs of spaceships have any impact on Earth's orbit? As negligible as they might be?
Every bit of mass lost (sent into space) decreases the gravity of our planet, as tiny as the change might be. Is that correct?
Could the loss of Earth's mass over time (Hypothetically - centuries in the future, with tens of thousands of spaceships having left Earth.) change the orbit of Earth or produce any side-effects?
