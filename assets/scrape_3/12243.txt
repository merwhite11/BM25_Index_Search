What is the temperature on surface of Pluto facing Sun?

According to wiki page, the mean temperature of Pluto is 44 degree K (-229 degree C). However, given that Pluto is tilted greatly and there is daylight for long periods on part of Pluto facing the Sun and also given that atmosphere of Pluto scatters light to a high degree, the surface temperature on that part of Pluto may be higher. The atmosphere of Pluto contains methane which is a powerful greenhouse gas, and that also could push up the temperature. 
What can be the maximum temperature on part of Pluto facing the Sun? Does available temperature estimate take into account findings of New Horizons probe which flyby Pluto earlier this year? Thanks for your insight.
