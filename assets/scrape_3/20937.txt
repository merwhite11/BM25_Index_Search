How Can I View KIC 9832227?

I've heard that KIC 9832227 is a contact binary star system that is expected to merge and explode as a "red nova" sometime in the next ~5 years or so.

Before that happens, I'd like to see it.  Where would I need to be / what sort of equipment would I need in order to be able to view this before it goes nova?
