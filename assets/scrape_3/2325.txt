What shape are black holes theorized to be?

I have always been curious about what black holes (or their event horizons) would look like if we could directly observe them. I notice that they tend to be depicted as flat holes in space but it seems to me that they would be spheres. Is there a scientific consensus on this. Or is it a vague question?
