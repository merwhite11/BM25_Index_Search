Does Earth revolves around Milky Way?

As we know Earth rotates around Sun and Sun around Milky Way but then Sun must have some velocity/angular momentum (I don't know that much physics terms).
So as Earth revolves around Sun, it must adjust its orbit as Sun also revolves.
Is it so? Or am I missing something?
