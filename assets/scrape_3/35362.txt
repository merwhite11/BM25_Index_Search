The size of the Earth

Has the earth always been this size apart from a few occasional additions from time to time.
Meteorites hitting the planet now don’t become part of it and the moon when it collided just spun of into its orbit.
So how, as documentaries show, do chunks of rock stick together to form planets etc?
I get dust particles coming together to make suns eventually but in a vacuum. I don’t get how stuff with a large mass sticks together. When stuff with mass collides today it doesn’t stick together: Kuiper belt, rings of Saturn etc.
