How will nearby galaxies some day expand beyond our horizon? (Neil deGrasse Tyson)

In his appearance on Television contained in the video The Mystery That Keeps Neil deGrasse Tyson Up At Night, Astronomer andeducator Neil deGrasse Tyson says:

I donâ€™t want to be blamed if you can not get to sleep tonight.
This dark energy, in the future, will render the universe so large, having accelerated so significantly, that all the galaxies of the night sky will have accelerated beyond our horizon.
All the galaxies are the source of our knowledge of the big bang.
Everything we know about the history of the universe comes to us from these galaxies.
If they accelerate beyond our horizon, the next generation of cosmic explorers will only have the stars of the milky way to think about.

What does this mean, in simple terms if possible. How will nearby galaxies some day expand beyond our horizon (if that's what he's saying and if it is correct)?
