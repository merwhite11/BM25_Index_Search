Examples of Equal Mass, Unequal Mass and Double Binary Star Systems

Can anyone give me an example of a star (ideally those with a common name e.g. Rigel, Sirius, etc) of the following multiple star systems.
Equal Mass Star System, where two binary stars orbit round a central point of space.
Unequal Mass Star System, where a smaller star(s) orbits round a larger binary star.
Double Binary where two sets of binary stars orbit round a spot. (Regulus?)
