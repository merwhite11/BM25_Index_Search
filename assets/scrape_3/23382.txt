Is it possible that a satellite creates a forever eclipse?

So, to add a bit of context, I’m doing the NaNoWriMo challenge, which consists of writing a novel of 50k words in one month. My whole idea is based around the following question: What would happen if the sun were to suddenly disappear?
To make it short, the story is about a colony on a faraway planet, which is settled for few generations already. And one day or let’s say, in less than a month, the sun disappear. So far, so good. Except I need a valid reason as to why the sun disappear… I have found some ideas (dust from volcanic eruption, change of orbit, dying sun, etc…) but none of them looked good enough. (I’m open for suggestion if any.)
I’m now investigating the possibility that the planet would gain a satellite big enough to hide the sun on the whole planet (like an eclipse but lasting forever). This topic lead me to think that if the satellite is in geostationary orbit, it is possible. But there is still some questions I can’t get my head around.

How fast a new satellite can “appear”?
Is it possible that a bigger but “lighter” (with less gravitational force) satellite can orbit around a smaller but “heavier” planet?
This topic reminded me that no sun means no heat. Can the geothermic activity of a planet be enough to prevent the surface from being impossible to live on? (Off topic.)

So, basically, the question is, if it's possible to have a forever eclipse, how ?
I’m sorry in advance if the questions are not clear enough, even though I understand the basics, I don’t necessarily have all the technical terms.
Thank you !!
