Which quantum reality will be seen in a far away galaxy

I recently watched Brian Greene documentaries on parallel universes and am trying to wrap my brain around multiple quantum universes that form at every event and Einstein's relativity that in space-time, past present and future coexist so we can observe the future of a far away galaxy from Earth by moving. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO_Q_f1WgQI - Around 7th minute - explains how an alien moving towards earth has a now slice cutting in Earth's future
My question is which quantum universe will be seen because future events in that galaxy would create multiple such universes.
My question is regarding many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics according to which multiple alternate futures are possible https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation
