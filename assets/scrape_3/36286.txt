When was the atmosphere of Venus first observed?

Nowadays, atmospheres of transiting exoplanets are being characterized. We can measure the absorption of the star's light through the exosphere of exoplanets. 
The same can be done closer to Earth, with the inner planets. In fact, this was done during the 2012 Venus transit. 
When is the first time that a transit was used to study the atmosphere of Venus ?
