Discontinuity in space-time

What I understood about it till now is that space-time fabric is kind of broken there. Please tell me whether I am correct.

If it's true then does it mean that perception of time will stop there?
I really can't get what broken space fabric is like. If it's a hole then how is matter supposed to be present inside that?
Is a black hole a discontinuity?
