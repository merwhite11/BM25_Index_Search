Would it be possible to equip an asteroid to collect space junk in Earth's orbit?

We all have heard about the problem with space junk in low earth orbit. NASA has a plan to put an asteroid in orbit around the moon. Would it be possible to equip propulsion systems onto an asteroid in order to maneuver it into an elliptical orbit around the earth, with the goal of collecting this junk?
