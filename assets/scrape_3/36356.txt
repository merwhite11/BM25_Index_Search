Why isn't there a large gap in the number of captured moons Jupiter and Saturn have?

Given that Jupiter is roughly 3x as massive compared to Saturn and is located right next to the asteroid belt, it feels that Jupiter should easily have a larger amount of captured moons. However currently, due to a recent survey of Saturn discovering 20 new moons, Saturn has 57 observed captured moons compared to Jupiters 71. 
Also summing the mass of the 6 largest captured moons for each planet gives:
- Jupiter: 7.844*10^18kg
- Saturn: 8.372*10^18kg
Why isn't there a larger gap between the number and mass of Jupiter and Saturns captured moons?
Note:
While Jupiter has a very large amount of Trojan asteroids, the main focus of the question is moons directly in orbit around the main planet.
