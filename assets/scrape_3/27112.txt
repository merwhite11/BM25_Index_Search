What percentage of gas giant exoplanets are in the habitable zone?

Approximately what percent of exoplanet gas giants discovered so far are in the habitable zones of their stars? I hear that most of them are "Hot Jupiters", orbiting so close to their stars that the heat causes them to swell up like a hot air balloon.
