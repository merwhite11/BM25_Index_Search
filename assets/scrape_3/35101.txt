How long could an ocean last in space?

If all of Earth's oceans were suddenly moved into outer space, how long would it take for them to evaporate?
My understanding is that water evaporates straight away in space... but what about when it's a quantity as large as an ocean?
Would it be a matter of seconds? minutes?
Would it be possible to swim in an ocean, that was floating in space, for a short while before it all evaporated?
