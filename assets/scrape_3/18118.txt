On the lack of observational records by European astronomers of the 1054 guest star

This question relates to the Crab nebula, the Crab Pulsar and the known concurrent supernovae event as recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054.
I'm wondering, I'm looking at the history of the discovery of the Crab pulsar...and I'm wondering what the reason is (or suspected to be) as to why European records show a discernible lack of observations?
