Eclipses of Jupiter's Moon during Retrograde motion

When Jupiter is undergoing retrograde motion as seen from the Earth, would you expect the eclipses of Jupiterâ€™s moons to occur several minutes early, several minutes late, or neither? 
Can someone please explain?
I am a novice in astronomy, and I read a couple of articles on the retrograde motion. I understand it is an illusion. But how would I expect the eclipses of Jupiter's moon?
