How is a Galaxy formed?

How is a galaxy formed? I know that the center of our galaxy is considered to be Sagittarius A* and it's surrounded by a lot of stars (also a lot of neutron stars).
But what makes this happen? I mean, why are all those stars in that right formation, like other galaxies, rather than just being random clouds of stars in the universe?
