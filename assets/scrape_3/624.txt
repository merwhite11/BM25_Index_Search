How do large solar flares compare to flares on other stars?

Solar flares are violent releases of solar magnetic energy. Other stars are also known to have magnetic fields, in some cases much stronger than the Sun. How do the largest stellar flares compare to the largest solar flares in terms of energy released? It would also be interesting to normalize the answer by the strength of the magnetic field to be able to compare the efficiency of magnetic energy release on other stars compared to the Sun.
