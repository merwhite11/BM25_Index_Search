How can the Sun block an X-ray telescope from observing a QPO galaxy "for several years"?

Phys.org's Black hole's heart still beating  says:

X-ray satellite observations spotted the repeated beat after its signal had been blocked by our Sun for a number of years.

I can't imagine any kind of satellite orbit (Lagrange-point associated, Earth orbit, Heliocentric) for which the direction of the Sun would prevent a suitable orientation "for a number of years" assuming that number is greater than 0.5.
Why was this so?
