What evidence is there of Earth-Like internal features of Europa?

This question is inspired by "What are the Earth-like features of Titan?".  According to NASA's Europa overview, Europa is believed to have an iron core, rocky mantle and an ocean under the frozen surface.
Does the tidal heating of Europa's interior by Jupiter make it a smaller analogue for Earth?
