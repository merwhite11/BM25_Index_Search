How to tell a pulsar is rotation-powered or accretion-powered?

We need to calculate P/Pdot?
A pulsar may switch between theses two states.
For a rotation powered pulsar, it can pulse and, the pulsed Lx can be much larger than the luminosity given by its rotation?  
If Lx is very small, smaller than the luminosity given by its rotation, how to tell it is rotation-powered or accretion-powered? There are not necessarily X-ray pulsations
You can see I am asking a very tricky scenario.
