Could a moon of a mini-neptune around a red dwarf harbour life?

I am planning a game where on could control evolution on an alien world.
I was thinking red dwarf as per here Habitable Planet around Red Dwarf
To my understanding three questions arise:

Tidal lock
Radiation
Sunspots

Could a parent body (think small gas giant) be tidally locked and a moon then freely rotate? Could the magnetic field of a parent body protect a moon from a sun without the parent radiating too much?
I don't know what to say about sunspots though.
Then about the parent body itself:
Is the formation of the mini-neptune so close to a red dwarf impossible? Would its gravity wreck eveything?
