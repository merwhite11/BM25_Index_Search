What telescope might this be a model of, with Sir Fred Hoyle?

The BBC article Archaeopteryx: The day the fossil feathers flew has nothing to do with Astronomy but it shows a file photo of the famous astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle with a model of what looks like some kind of telescope.
I don't know if the "dish" is supposed to be fixed metal to reflect radio waves, or a rotating dish of mercury to reflect light, but I'm guessing the former is more likely. It looks like an off-axis, tilted secondary mirror reflects radiation back to ground level, but it's just a model so I can't be sure.
Are there any ideas what real instrument (if any) or at least what design that this fixed-"dish" model might be a model of?
What's scary is that at the bottom right it looks like a building several stories tall, which means that the telescope is huge, and the size of Sir Hoyle is on par with Godzilla. The time frame seems right for that too! ;-)
