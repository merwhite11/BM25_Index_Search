Stargazing (Tenerife) - different quality today and yesterday

I'm on the Tenerife island and (in the mountains above the clouds - 2300) the day before yesterday, I could clearly see the Milky Way and stars (1 am). So I went to the same place yesterday and the quality was much worse (at midnight).
I'm curious why there was such a difference and what parameters could cause this difference.

bigger moon?
different moon position?
sand from Sahara?

It's El Teide park cerca 2300 meters above the sea.
Is it worth to try again today? What parameters should I look up? It's like 2 hours of driving so I would like to be able to estimate the results in advance.
