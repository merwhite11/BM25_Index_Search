What should I look for in an astronomy tripod?

I have a Celstron SkyMaster 20x80 binoculars, and a tripod — Vanguard 263AT with a SBH-100 head.
The binoculars weighs 2.2kg, while the head is rated to a loading capacity of 10kg, and the legs to a tilted loading capacity of 5kg. This means that the tripod should work well, but it doesn't — it vibrates a lot even when my face gently touches the eyepiece, even without the center column extended, so much so that it becomes a pain to use the binoculars.
So I'm considering upgrading my tripod legs. I'd like this tripod to work well not just with the 20x80 binoculars I have, but also with a 25x100 pair of binoculars I'm considering buying (weight: 4.6kg), and maybe a small telescope (say with a 6-inch aperture).
Am I correct in understanding that:

I need to upgrade my tripod legs.
I don't need to upgrade the head, since it's rated to twice the capacity of the legs, and to twice the weight of the biggest binoculars I'll use.
I should look for legs that are rated to twice the weight of the biggest binoculars I'll use.
I should look for a set of wooden legs, since these have greater stability than aluminium legs while being affordable, unlike carbon fiber.
What else should I keep in mind when I look for an astronomy tripod?


I read that:

[...] the most popular materials are aluminum, carbon fiber, and,
  somewhat surprisingly, wood. It’s one of those common compromises—pick
  two of the following three: weight, price, and/or vibration dampening.
Wood is extremely good at absorbing vibrations, and is pretty
  affordable, but weighs a ton. Carbon fiber is light and stable, but
  you’ll pay for it. Aluminum is affordable, and fairly light, but is
  prone to channeling vibrations.

So I'll prioritise stability and affordability over weight.
