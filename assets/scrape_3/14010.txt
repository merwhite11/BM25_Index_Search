Has THC been detected in space?

I was wondering if and how astronomers have/had detected the molecule Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), commonly known for it's effects in marijuana, in space.
I had previously seen a hoax regarding the drug being detected on an exoplanet, but I wanted to know if there was any possibility of it.
