Is blue light not traveling faster then red light in space?

I just can't understand why light and other massless particles are not traveling at different speeds?
Gravity effects anything with a mass but light has no mass but a black hole, and weak lensing changes the trajectory of light to create more red shifted light more than blue shifted light. That tells me light has mass. Can someone clarify this to me in Laymons terminology? 
Pictures would be helpful.
