Is it possible to have a star orbiting around a brown dwarf?

I know a single star is almost surely more massive than a single brown dwarf, but consider a case: a very small star is orbiting a very massive brown dwarf which has a very massive moon, such that the total mass of that brown dwarf and its moon is larger than that of the star. Not counting capturing, is this type of system possible (formed naturally)?
