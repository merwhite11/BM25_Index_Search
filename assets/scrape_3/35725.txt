In practice, can very high magnetic fields significantly alter the dynamics of an astronomical-scale bodies?

The direct effect of magnetic fields on the dynamics (as in the movements, trajectories etc of the bodies themselves, rather than lower-level phenomena like stellar winds and atmospheric degradation) of astronomical bodies in places like the solar system are so weak that they can be ignored without real consequence. But it seems intuitive that in the vicinity of bodies with extremely high magnetic fields - such as magnetars - that such fields would have a significant or even dominant effect dynamically, requiring electromagnetism to be considered alongside gravity in order to supply an accurate dynamical description of the system. 
Considering the fact that the magnetic fields of such bodies range upward of 100 billion Telsa, the fact that the coupling constant for electromagnetism is some 40 orders of magnitude greater than that of gravity, and the fact that magnetic force drops off with the square of distance just as gravity does, it seems odd that such magnetic fields wouldn't have such an effect (at least on other bodies with magnetic fields, as well as bodies with a high content of ferromagnetic materials), but I've never heard any mention of such a thing. So what I'm wondering is if such behavior is expected in the vicinity of highly magnetized astronomical bodies, and if not, what am I overlooking here?
