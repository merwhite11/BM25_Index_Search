Aren't there more naked-eye-visible stars in the Milky Way plane?

Most stars which are visible to the naked eye are within 1,000 light years. The Sun is inside the Orion arm which has a diameter of about 3,500 light years. Thus, all stars (with very few exceptions) we can see unaided are inside the Orion arm and should be equally distributed in all directions. The structure of the galaxy is too large to affect the distribution of visible stars.
Still, we do see the Milky Way disk. What is it we see? The dim light of stars we can't make out individually? Or star light reflected by gas clouds? And is the density of stars to the unaided eye really not higher in the plane of the Milky Way? (Since I'm living in a light polluted city I can't easily check it out myself)
