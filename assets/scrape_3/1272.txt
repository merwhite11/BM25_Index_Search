Which planet or moon has all resources that can be used to sustain life in a controlled biosphere?

Now that we are making it to Mars, continuing onward, in an effort for humanity to civilize other planets, not just setting up residential colonies, but to mine minerals and carry on geological and scientific research, which planet or moon has all resources that can be used to sustain life in a controlled biosphere?
And how can the available resources on that body be converted to suit human requirement?
