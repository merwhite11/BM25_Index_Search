What's that ring that only now appears in black hole illustrations?


If you'll notice, space time starts to deform near the black hole, but then at considerable distance from the black hole' surface, images in the background become ultra-distorted, but then as you look even closer to the black hole, the distortion starts to look normal again almost like nothing is happening except for a minor fish-eye lens effect. 
If space-time distorts in a monotonic way as you approach the surface of a black hole, how does this ring of ultra-distortion exist? Why doesn't the image look even more distorted at the surface than at that ring?
