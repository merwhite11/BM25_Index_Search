Astronomy Olympiad Books

I'd like to one day take the Astronomy Olympiad, however I'm at a loss to know where to begin. As it currently stands I have no experience whatsoever with Astronomy. If there are people here with some expertise on the matter, I'd like to know what books you would recommend to study? The syllabus is at the following link: https://www.ioaastrophysics.org/syllabus/
