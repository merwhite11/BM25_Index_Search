How far are we from the edge of the Universe?

Following the Big Bang the Universe continues to expand, presumably and roughly equally in all directions. It is understood that the Big Bang occurred 13.798 Â± 0.037 billion years ago.
Is there any way for us to know how far we are away from the nearest edge of the expansion front of the Big Bang?
