Retrograde motion of planets: reason and time?

As beginner, I would like to understand how planets exhibit retrograde motion.
When does the retrograde motion start for a planet like Mars and how long (time limit) planets will appear to be in such motion?
Any good URL or simple explanation will be helpful.
