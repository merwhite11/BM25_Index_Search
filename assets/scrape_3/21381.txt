How do we not know what's in the Solar System?

It seems every once in a while there's a claim of a new planet in the Solar System.
I don't understand how local planets can stay undiscovered for this long when astronomers are accomplishing what seem to be far more difficult feats.
For example, it's been a whole century since they had accurate enough measurements to tell that Mercury was precessing in a way that didn't jive with Newtonian mechanics.
Now, if there are Earth-sized planets out there, shouldn't their presence have a pretty sizable effect on the orbits of bodies such as Neptune and Pluto? How can there be such large planets with no measurable effects until 2017 technology came along?
