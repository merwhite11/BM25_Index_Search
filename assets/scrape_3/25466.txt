Has a “white hole” theory been advanced to explain anomalous star formation in Sagittarius A?

In 2008, the European Southern Observatory reported, upon the end of a 16-year study described here http://www.eso.org/public/usa/news/eso0846/, that the 28 stars nearest the very large black hole in Sagittarius A included 22 in varied orbits compared to a "swarm of bees", and six (all slightly farther from the BH) in a disc of very fast orbits. As the stars were "too young" to have migrated far, and as the tidal forces in black holes had apparently been felt to leave star formation in that region unlikely, further research was planned. I'm asking whether there might have been any results, given the torsion-based cosmology which pairs black holes with white ones and is most concisely described at arXiv.org > https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08834.
The spin of smaller celestial bodies may affect the spin of the larger systems of which they're a part to an extremely great extent, according to a version of inflationary cosmology developed by physicist Nikodem Poplawski since 2009. The simplest statement of his cosmology is at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.0587.pdf, but, in spite of its title as an "alternative" to cosmological inflation, it actually describes a version of that theory, as pointed out in the Wikipedia article "Inflation": Poplawski's version uses an extension of Einstein's General Relativity that's usually referred to as the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble (ECSK) theory of gravity, and was developed, partly in consultation between Einstein and the French mathematician Cartan, to incorporate particulate spin (the rotation of subatomic particles) into relativity, since GR had been formulated several years before such spin was discovered. 
Partly because ECSK made an assumption that fermions (loosely describable as "matter particles") have a spatial extent (tiny, but about 37 times the Planck length) that's incompatible with a renormalization technique useful in quantum mechanics (which generally requires all subatomic particles to be pointlike), and perhaps partly because its application to cosmology allows a universe that's eternal to the past and to the future rather than one that's eternal only to the future, the ECSK theory has not been widely utilized in cosmology until recently, when physicists exasperated with the failure to discover any specialized subatomic particle that would cause inflation began turning to it. As you can see on p.7 in the piece I've linked you to, Poplawski's torsion-based cosmology may be falsified if there's no evidence for any prevalent direction of rotation, whereas inflationary cosmology that's based on a field of hypothesized "inflaton" particles cannot be falsified at all, leading to many recent objections to it by theoreticians.
I'd also like to know (if possible) whether the direction of the orbits of the stars concerned is the same as the direction of rotation of the super-massive BH itself, assuming that the latter was not inferred from the former: This would help me to assess the plausibility of this BH cosmology, as one of its leading proponents (Nikodem Poplawski) feels the arrow of time to derive from the direction of matter's passage across the event horizons of BHs, and has also felt the torsion-based theory to be falsifiable by the lack of a prevalent direction of rotation in the universe. (These are details to me, but might appear in whatever conversations or observations might contain the answer to my question.)
