Did a galaxy get discovered more than 30 billion light-years away? How does one observe light older than the estimated age of the universe?

I'm more into questioning mainstream science and pseudo-science to remain open-minded.
Why is it that we are seeing light 30 billion light years away; when the estimated age of the universe is much younger?
How does space-stretching circumvent the light-speed limit?
