Can young surface of Venus be caused by early oceans instead of global resurface event?

There is evidence of a global resurface event on Venus: the craters are young and evenly distributed.
Is it possible that there is another reason: Venus had a very deep ocean in the past, and that hindered formation of craters on the young planet
Venus is believed to have had a large amount of water when it formed, but the water molecule has been broken down due to lacking magnetic field for protection, and the hydrogen released has escaped from the planet. 
My hypothesis is:

In ancient times, Venus had a very deep ocean
The very deep ocean prevents formation of impact craters on the ancient planet, so no old impact craters are found on the surface of Venus
Later, the water in the ocean was broken down into hydrogen and oxygen  by solar activity, so the water level decreased.
When most water had escaped from planet, asteroids can strike the crust directly and form impact craters.
As most impact craters can only be formed after the water escaped, so we can only find young craters at the surface of Venus.

Is my hypothesis possible?
