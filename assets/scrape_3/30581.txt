Eddington luminosity in various plasmas

So I know that the Eddington luminosity is given by:
$L_{Eddington} = 4\pi GMc/\kappa$. 
I want to calculate this luminosity for a plasma of purely ionized helium, as well as for an electron-positron plasma.
How do I find $\kappa$ in each of these cases? I know sometimes this is approximated as $m/\sigma_T$, but I'm not sure when to invoke this approximation, and what the respective mass would be.
