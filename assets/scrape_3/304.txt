How fast do we travel through space?

Could someone give the rough estimates of speeds of our travel through space?
I can easily find the two nearby ones:

Earth's own rotation - depending on latitude, up to 40,075 km/24h = 463 m/s
Earth's orbital speed around the Sun - 940 000 000 km/year = 29,786 m/s

Now how do these fare?

Motion of Sun within the arm of the galaxy, around the center of the galaxy?
Motion of the galaxy within the local supercluster?
(if possible to measure at all) movement of the supercluster within the universe?
