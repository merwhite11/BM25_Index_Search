How dense would planet earth have to be to have the same gravity as Jupiter?

I was reading this question about how small could a planet be while having earth-like gravitational pull. 
This got me thinking, how dense would planet Earth have to be to have the same gravitational pull as Jupiter while all the other factors staying the same (even if it is impossible in the real world)?
If there are any formulas could you please explain them so I understand them please?
Edit
Sorry about some of the confusion but I meant keeping everything but the mass the same.
