How do astronomers detect gases that are in the atmosphere of exoplanets?

Exoplanets are planets that are located outside our solar system - whether that be orbiting a star or drifting past one. Now, the closest star to us is Alpha Centauri which is just over four light-years away. So, how can astronomers detect gases in the atmospheres of planets over this distance with any degree of accuracy (or at all)?
