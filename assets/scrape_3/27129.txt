Why was the July 27th 2018 lunar eclipse not visible in North America?

I was just wondering if it had anything to do with the fact that last year we were blessed with the opportunity to see the total solar eclipse in our neck of the woods. So this is the universe's way of making things 'even'. Or is it pure chance and luck?
Jokes aside, there is probably a physics explanation regarding tidal forces or angular momentum, so I am curious how these factors affect which parts of the world get to witness the event.
