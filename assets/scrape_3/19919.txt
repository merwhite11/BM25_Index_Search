Can you identify this planet seen in the night sky?

I saw a very bright star in the night sky on Monday (Jan 30, 2017). The star was in the Western sky and was directly above the crescent moon.
My location is Toronto, Ontario. Canada. It was about 8pm at night, but by 10pm the star had disappeared over the horizon.
I'm sure this was a planet as it shined brighter then any of the other stars, but I couldn't guess which one.
Can you identify this planet for me?
