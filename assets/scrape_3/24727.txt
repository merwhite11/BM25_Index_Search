Hazy patch with huge comet tail

Tonight between 4:30 am & 5 am, we were star gazing on a skyscraper. We saw hazy illuminated triangle patch. We took out star app but didn't find any comet passing through that region & I was sure it wasn't Andromeda Galaxy. I'm not sure what I watched. 
Please note we thought it could be light of aeroplane, but we were sure it wasn't as it didn't move quickly. The second thought was some form of satellite. I think there isn't any satellite with that much light.
Please can anyone help me identify hazy triangle patch in the sky. I am attaching star map of my sky. The region I saw the hazy patch is marked with red circle on the map.
I'm based out of Mumbai. I don't want my curiosity to die without knowing what I saw, I'm happy to be wrong if it isn't any stellar object. Thank you.
