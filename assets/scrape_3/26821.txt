Effects of a rogue planet passing between the Earth and the Moon?

The plot of Thundarr the Barbarian got me thinking about the science behind 

the passage of a runaway planet between the Earth and the Moon

and its effect on the Earth and Moon themselves, as well as their orbits.
For the following scenario:

planet has half the mass of Earth, and is moving at 16km/s
moving perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic
passes directly between the Earth and the Moon with closest distance to Earth of 192,500 km

What sort of effects, if any, might this have on Earth and those of us residing there during the passage in later months and years?
