Could two stars collide without a resultant explosion?

Are there any scenarios in which two stars could collide, and simply fuse without triggering a supernova. Maybe a mid-sized star slowly spiraling in together with a smaller star? It seems like any time stars collide it's incredibly violent. It seems that one star always gets torn to pieces and accretes matter onto the other, or ends in a red nova. Is there any way this process could be calmer?
