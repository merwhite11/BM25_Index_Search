How to prove to my friend that aliens have never visited earth

I come from a physics background where I don't believe something unless the evidence is shown to me, however I have a friend who believes Aliens have visited earth , which he believes based on conspiracy theories.
My question is: is there any solid scientific reasoning as to why the conspiracy theories aren't true. As for him I need to give him evidence as to why they don't exist , and not the other way around .
