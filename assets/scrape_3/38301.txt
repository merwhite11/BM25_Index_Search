Why does Stellarium tell such imprecise distance for Betelgeuse?

The newest version of Stellarium, as well as the former ones, tell that Betelgeuse would be 497.95 ly plus/minus 56 ly away. Celestia also lists Betelgeuse ~500 ly away, but Celestia is comparably old. Isn't it a proven fact that Betelgeuse is about 640 ly away? Why is Stellarium so imprecise?
Rob Jeffries' comment below and this link answer my question well, rather than the link provided above.
