Could the largest SMBH swallow an entire galaxy?

It is unlikely that the largest supermassive black hole in the universe has already been discovered, there may be much larger ones. 
Are there, or could there be, supermassive black holes large enough to swallow whole galaxies as opposed to the occasional star?
Are there other factors beyond size that would also affect a SMBH's ability to swallow it's own galaxy?
