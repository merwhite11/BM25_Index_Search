How can the Event Horizon Telescope image Sgr A* when it's not visible from all sites at one time?

I went to https://eventhorizontelescope.org/array and read about the ten sites listed as part of the EHT, I have a mashed-up screen shot of them below.
I made a little script also shown below with approximate coordinates, and saw that Sgr A* is at a declination of about -29.5 degrees (South).  I spun it around the earth, calculated the dot product between each of the sites' position vectors and all normals pointing to Sgr A* as it rotates around the Earth.
I then plotted the elevation angle above the horizon for all ten sites. I was quite surprised!

Sgr A* is never above the horizon for the Greenland telescope!
Sgr A* is never simultaneously visible even to all of the remaining nine telescopes

Have I made a mistake? If not, how do these ten sites combine their data to image Sgr A*?

        self.norm = np.array([clon*clat, slon*clat, slat])
