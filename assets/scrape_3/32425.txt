Gravitational waves: how can scientists derrive the sizes and spin and distance of two merging black holes?

After recording the ripples of  passing gravity waves I would imagine that some high-power math would be required to derive information about the sizes, spin, and distance of the merging black holes. Is it possible to get some insight into how they figured out one was 31 solar masses and the other was 20? How do you "see" spin from a wave?
