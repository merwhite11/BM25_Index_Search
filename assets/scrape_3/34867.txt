What influence does the Interplanetary Magnetic Field have on Planetary Orbits?

CONTEXT
The equation $F_D=\frac{GMm}{D^2}$ is a standard equation in Newtonian gravitation. It describes the centripetal force exerted, by a source mass$M$, on a target particle of mass $m$  located at distance $D$. Here $G$ is Newton's Universal Constant of Gravitation.
The Non-Newtonian Apsidal Rotation Anomalies ( aka "Perihelion Precession", first observed by LeVerrier for Mercury) observed in planetary orbits are explained by General Relativity. For example the formula $F_D=\frac{GMm}{D^2}*\left(1 + \frac{3GM.P}{C^2}\frac{1}{D^2} \right)$  where $P$ is the semi-latus rectum of the elliptical orbit of the target and $C$ is the speed of light.
However it is known (e.g. Wells 2011 ) that Apsides Rotation anomalies (in the context of perihelion precession, very similar to those from GR) can also be generated from an alternative, hypothetical, model by invoking a supra-Newtonian inverse-distance-cubed force, independent of $P$; as per the following equation:-
$F_D=\frac{GMm}{D^2} *\left(1 + \frac{K}{D} \right)$ where $K=\frac{6.GM}{C^2}$. At the distance of Earth the additional force is ~ $6*10^{-11}$ times the Newtonian force.
According to wikipedia:-

The Sun's Dipole Magnetic Field of 50–400 μT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1 nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the Interplanetary Magnetic Field at Earth's location is around 5 nT, about a hundred times greater (see Figs 11,12 in Svalgaard & Cliver 2010 ). The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.

A paper by Laine & Lin 2011 considers long-term angular orbital momentum transfer through electromagnetic interactions between Stellar Magnetic Fields and close-in Super Earths.

The source of energy is the differential motion between the (close-in Super-Earth) planet and the magnetosphere of its host star. The Lorentz force on the planet and its host star leads to an evolution toward a state of synchronous rotation. Inside the corotation radius, planets tend to lose angular momentum and migrate inward and the opposite trend occurs outside the corotation radius. Consequently, planets inside corotation migrate inward and those outside corotation migrate outward.

Their analysis is too far beyond my current knowledge of physics for me to extrapolate to the case of the modern Solar System. But it does suggest to me that electromagnetic interactions between the Sun and its rocky satellites may lead to transfer of angular momentum from the former to the latter.
QUESTION
(a) How does the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) vary with distance from the Sun (e.g. does it decay in strength with distance in proportion to $1/D^3$ ?, what is the orientation of $B$?, ...)
(b) what quantitative effects does the present Solar System IMF have on the orbits of the planets and asteroids?
UPDATE
After a bit more trawling through wikipedia I guess that the problem can be modelled (initially) in terms of the force between two magnetic dipoles. The force exerted on $m_2$ is given by:-
$$F = \frac{3\mu_0}{4\pi |r|^4}((\hat{r}*m_1)*m_2+(\hat{r}*m_2)*m_1-2\hat{r}(m_1. m_2)+5\hat{r}((\hat{r}*m_1).(\hat{r}*m_2))$$
where $r$ is the relative position vector, $m_1,m_2$ are the magnetic moment vectors and $\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability or magnetic constant.
An alternative, equivalent formula given by Yung et al, equation 37, 1998 for the force exerted by $m_1$ on $m_2$ is:-
$$F = \frac{3\mu_0 |m_1| |m_2|}{4\pi |r|^4}\left(
\hat{r}(\hat{m_1}.\hat{m_2})
+\hat{m_1}(\hat{r}.\hat{m_2}) 
+\hat{m_2}(\hat{r}.\hat{m_1}) 
-5\hat{r}(\hat{r}.\hat{m_1}).(\hat{r}.\hat{m_2})
\right)$$
Note that the magnitude of the dipole-to-dipole force varies in proportion to $1/r^4$.
The dipoles will also exert torques on each other. The torque exerted by dipole 1 on dipole 2 is given by:- $$\tau = m_2 * B_1$$.

Interplanetary Magnetic Field
User /u/uhoh pointed out in a different question that the IMF has a major effect on the Sun's magnetic influence.
From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_magnetic_field:-

The plasma in the interplanetary medium is also responsible for the strength of the Sun's magnetic field at the orbit of the Earth being over 100 times greater than originally anticipated. If space were a vacuum, then the Sun's magnetic dipole field — about 10−4 teslas at the surface of the Sun — would reduce with the inverse cube of the distance to about 10−11 teslas. But satellite observations show that it is about 100 times greater at around 10−9 teslas. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory predicts that the motion of a conducting fluid (e.g., the interplanetary medium) in a magnetic field induces electric currents, which in turn generates magnetic fields — and, in this respect, it behaves like an MHD dynamo.


The interplanetary magnetic field at the Earth's orbit varies with waves and other disturbances in the solar wind, known as "space weather." The field is a vector, with components in the radial and azimuthal directions as well as a component perpendicular to the ecliptic. The field varies in strength near the Earth from 1 to 37 nT, averaging about 6 nT.[5]
