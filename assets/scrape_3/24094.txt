What should be the declination of a star to be marginally circumpolar given the latitude & height from ground?

If I'm given the latitude, I can easily find the declination by using
declination = 90 - latitude.
I can also find the angle of dip from the height but should I add or subtract it from the declination I found?
Also I have to consider atmospheric refraction but I don't know how.
