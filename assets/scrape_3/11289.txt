which pulsar has the longest spin period so far?

Vela X-1 has a 283s spin period, while this one may have a 2.7hr spin period.
However neither of them is included in ATNF catalog.
They are not included in $p-\dot{p}$ diagram either. The longest period is just about 10s in this diagram.
My question is since Vela X-1 is definitely a pulsar, why is it not accepted? 
Which one has the longest spin period so far?

When this diagram is mentioned in textbooks, we do not say which kind of pulsars are included at all. Why?
$p-\dot{p}$ diagram only shows radio pulsars?  no!
you can see magnetars,radio quiet pulsars and pulsars which are only active in $\gamma-ray$
Except magnetars, there are no single pulsars only pulse in X-ray band?
If a pulsar pulses in X-ray band, that does not necessarily mean it is an X-ray pulsar?
Only pulsars in binaries and accretion-powered pulsars could be called X-ray pulsars? They should be radio-quiet?
In binaries, there are no pulsars which pulse in radio and x-ray band simultaneously?
