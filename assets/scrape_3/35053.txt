How much rock has Jupiter "swallowed"?

During its formation approximately 4.5 bya, Jupiter passed through what is now the asteroid belt,gravitationally deflecting some spacewards and some sunwards.
Logically, Jupiter, due to its massive gravity, must have swallowed up a fair portion as well.
Is there any way to calculate how much rock Jupiter contains? Have any estimates been made?
