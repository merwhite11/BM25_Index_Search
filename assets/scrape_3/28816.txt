How do they measure sub-centimeter wave height on a moon of Saturn?

Michael Stevens from V-Sauce has a video called The Mandelbrot Set on a different channel. At 12:56 he says:

Thereâ€™s a moon of Saturn that has liquid hydrocarbon lakes that literally have waves that are only like a fraction of a centimeter large, but, you could surf that, right?

While Michael occasionally does indeed say things that appear to be wrong I'm guessing he got this correct.
How are waves a fraction of a centimeter tall measured on a moon of Saturn? How is the existence of these waves either measured or deduced?
