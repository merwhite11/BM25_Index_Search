How to deal with data that's billions of years old?

We look at galaxies that are billions of light years distant and draw conclusions based on the red shift of the light. How is the age of the light accounted for. We see the reality of a galaxy perhaps a billion years ago. Why not conclude that redshift is related to time instead of distance?
