Any book on `How do they know it (in Astronomy)`?

I am reading my college/undergraduate level astronomy textbook. It has lots of Ã­nfomation but every page raises a similar question in my mind: "How do they know it?". It starts from simple things like radius of Earth, other planets, masses, composition, distances of stars, temperatures, luminosities etc. "How do scientists know/determine these facts?" is a question that pops up in my mind about every fact I have read. Do you have any book recommendations which mostly (if not exclusively) focuses on the question "How do scientists know it?"
