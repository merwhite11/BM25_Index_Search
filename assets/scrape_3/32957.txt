Snowball Earth brightness

The Earth likely froze over almost completely about 700 million years ago. This increased its albedo significantly, and I wonder if that would have a considerable effect on its apparent magnitude from other planets. (The Sun was like 4% fainter, though.)
If so, would the Earth be naked-eye visible from farther away 700 mya than it is now? Maybe from Uranus's moons?
