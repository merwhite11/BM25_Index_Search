Did Io start out as an icemoon?

Looking at the big moons of the outer solar system a clear pattern can be seen. Thick icey surface layers covering rocky mantles and deep down metallic cores. The only outlier is Io as it has no icey, but a rocky surface. Did Io form this way or has Jupiter's tidal heating now powering it's intense vulcanic activity cooked away its oceans? After all water vapor could not be retained on Io so if the surface ice where to melt it would escape Io for good.
