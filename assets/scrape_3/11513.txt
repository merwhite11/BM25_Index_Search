Help plotting a trip to the Moon!

Take me to the moon!
I know this is literally rocket science but, I would like any sources or formulas that would help me plot a trip to the Moon. I'm not sending anything, nor do I ever plan to, I just want to do the next best thing by plotting the trip. So if anyone could give me any info as to how I can plot the trip, that'd be great! :)
P.S. I'm perfectly aware that the moon isn't always the same distance away, that it's like hoping onto a taxi in New York City, and how it's got a lot of work (I wouldn't mind doing it really), I'd just like to plot the trip. And please don't hate on me for asking, let's just be civil adults here. :)
