Is the universe simply a mass of atoms in 'void'; what does it look like?

I've always been stumped with the question of what lies beyond the universe, and I've come to the firm conclusion - void (i.e. completely empty).  Does it make sense then to think of the universe as a finite 'blob' of atoms (the completely full) flying around each other in nothing?  Furthermore, and more importantly, does it have a shape like a sphere?
