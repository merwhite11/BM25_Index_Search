Precipitation and weather and seasons on other planets

I have participated in an exhibition on astronomy and decided to make a project on the topic "weather season and precipitation on other planets"
I have the knowledge about the weather on earth but I need to know more about that on other planets in the solar system like venus, mars, mercury and Jupiter etc or in other planets in the other galaxies.
Can anyone explain me how the precipitation and season  occurs,why do it occur, what is the effect,do they form clouds or something else,how do the temperature rotation and revolution affect the process? You can also suggest me some videos on this topic
Thanks in advance
