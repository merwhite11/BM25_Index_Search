Could anyone recommend a good book about the basics of astrophysics?

I am sorry if a similar question has been asked before. I look at other questions but was not entirely satisfied. So, I am a Psychology student who would like to know more about the basics of astrophysics. Could anyone recommend a good book about this. Also, I am particularly interested in black holes, so introductory literature on that is welcome too.
