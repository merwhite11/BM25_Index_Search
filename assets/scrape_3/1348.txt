How to plot orbit of binary star and calculate its orbital elements?

I have a set of dates, position angles ($\theta$) and angular separations ($\rho$) for visual binary star. For example:
1994.3132  57.0    0.097
1996.1783  73.4    0.051
2006.1938 182.0    0.126
2009.2597 192.9    0.152
etc.

What are algorithms to calculate orbital elements and to plot the orbit of the binary star?
Are there available codes (or programs) for this calculations?
