How do you convert an observed magnitude to a flux?

For a series of supernovae I have the observed magnitude and I want to convert these values to flux.
I understand that I need to apply:
$m - M_r = -2.5\log_{10} \frac{F}{F_r}$
where $M_r$ is a 'reference magnitude' with corresponding known 'reference flux'.
What exactly should I use as my reference values?
