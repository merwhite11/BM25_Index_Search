How big would the Earth look from the Moon?

Imagine standing (somewhere) on the Moon's surface. How big would the Earth look from the Moon, compared to the image of the Moon we see from Earth? What would be the ratio between the diameters of each body? How would this ratio be calculated? Any help with answering such a calculation would be highly appreciated.
