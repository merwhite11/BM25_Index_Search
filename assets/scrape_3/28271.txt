Why do stars twinkle but planets don't

Many people say that stars twinkle because of Earth's atmosphere. However, the atmosphere is still there when we look at planets and don't see they twinkling.
Is there a clear scientific consensual explanation for the twinkling of some objects but not for others?
Note: just as a metter of distinction, my question is different from this one. In fact, the moon is obviously different from stars, while my question is based on the fact that the only actual difference between stars and planets is that planets move across the sky, differently from stars (since they are the sky's reference). Proof of my words is the late distinction of Uranus as a planet due its extremely slow motion, although it also doesn't twinkle.
