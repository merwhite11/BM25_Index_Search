Is the Tombaugh Regio on Pluto visible from Earth?

Is the Tombaugh Regio on Pluto discernably visible from Earth ground based or Earth orbiting telescopes? And more generally, can surface features seen in Hubble images be matched with images from New Horizons? I can imagine a match from the image compilation I attach, with TR being the bright triangle, but is that intuition valid?
