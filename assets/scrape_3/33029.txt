"Table of Astronomy's" depiction of the solar system models

This is going to be a follow up question to my question about the "Table of Astronomy" from yesterday, What is this “Table of astronomy” about?.
I wanted to take a close look at the three depiction of the solar system models (left to right):

Fig. 43. Ptolemaic System; Fig. 45: Tychonic System; and Fig. 44: Copernican System; They are is this order in the original resource
I cant figure out what some of the symbols and circles are supposed to mean. I have marked everything im unsure about partially or completly in red.

(From left to right again)
Ptolemaic System:

The ptolemaic system is a geocentric system, meaning it has the Earth as its center. I have identified most of the symbols that mark the orbits, although I'm missing two. Furthermore, the 5 outer most orbits(?) are what I'm unsure about. As far as I understand it, Claudius Ptolemy believed not only that the Earth was the center of the universe (making this a model of the universe and not the solar system) but also, that the stars were laying on the inside of the universesphere. Therefore I can imagine that the innermost ring is just to close of the sphere. But there are still 4 rings left.
In addition to the rings, I cant identify the third (anchorlike) and the fifth symbol.
Tychonic System:

Here again I'm unsure about the two outer rings, and the third, not dotted, orbit around the Sun. 
The two innermost orbits are Venus and ?
If the (red)dotted orbit is supposed to be the Earth's orbit around the Sun, then why does the earth have two orbits? 
Also, what are the two stars under the Moon?
Copernican System:

This one is rather straight forward. I'd like to know which of Saturn's moon's orbits this illustration depicts and if my guesses on Jupiters moons are correct.
And at last, what are the 4 marks, A, B, C and D for?
I hope you can help me! Thanks
