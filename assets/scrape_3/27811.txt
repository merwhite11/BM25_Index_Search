Type of telescope on Star Trek

In the first episode of Star Trek: Discovery, we learn that Captain Georgiou has an old-fashioned telescope in her ready room. Michael Burnham inherits it a bit later in the season. I wonder if anyone can identify exactly which telescope it is. What's the model and manufacturer? It seems to be an equatorial-mounted refractor with a finder scope.
