Are there ways to estimate size of the "whole universe"?

Words escape me, but by "whole universe" (I think) I mean everything that's spatially connected to the observable universe in a conventional sense. If there is a better term for it, please let me know!
I was surprised to find out that theories and measurements about the big bang seem to mostly relate to the size of the observable universe via expansion, and if I understand correctly don't say much about the size of the whole universe.
Have I got this right? Are there any ways at all to try to estimate size of the whole universe? Does the term even mean anything?
See @RobJeffries' excellent answer to When will the number of stars be a maximum? and @Acccumulation's comment for background on this question.
