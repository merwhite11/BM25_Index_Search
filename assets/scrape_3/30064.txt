Seeing a line rather than a dot when looking through refracting telescope

I bought an amateur(and rather cheap) refracting telescope and while I can see moon quite clear and crispy I am having difficulties in observing some larger stars. 
All stars appear as lines rather than dots. It is always one longer line. I read something about those lines but this stands only for reflecting telescopes that have some kind of structure inside that holds a mirror and this structure interfers thus producing these lines. But I don't have a reflecting telescope, mine is refracting.
I cannot seem to find anything on google regarding this. Maybe it is because I lack the vocabulary.
EDIT #1:
This is the telescope I have.
Edit #2:
This is my depiction of what I see. Forgive my MS pain skills. As I focus out(or in, not quite familliar with the naming) it goes more clearer and clearer but I never get to see a simple shiny dot. The closes to dot is the first image but this is so blurry that I barely see it. The red line is the one I perceive as the clearest. The orange lines is what I perceive as "outline" and the yellow inside is that shiny effect one usually gets when looking at objects that emmit light.
