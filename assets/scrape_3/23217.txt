Would 2 stars in binary star formation with same mass and no velocity collide into each other?

Velocity decides if 2 stars with different masses in a binary star formation will collide or not, but if 2 stars with same mass existed but with no velocity (i.e they are not orbiting each other, just staying at their places at some distance), would they collide ? I guess the answer is no, but just not sure of how and where do the gravitational wave friction come into the scenario.
