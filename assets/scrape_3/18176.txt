How to get the axial tilt vector(x,y,z) relative to ecliptic

According to the orbital plane XYZ, I understand that the axial tilt is the angle between the planet axis rotation and any normal of the plane (actually Z in right handed system). BUT, this is not sufficient to define a vector direction, I need another angle into the XY plane. Where do I find this information?  Actually I believe it's relative to the direction of the periapsis. Am I right?
Following all the nice conversation on the answers, I maybe need to ask 
How to get the axial tilt vector(x,y,z) relative to ecliptic or orbital plane, given ONLY ONE angle, i.e. 23.439281 deg for the Earth, 25.19 for Mars, etc.
