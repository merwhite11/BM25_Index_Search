Could there be Earth-like planets in binary or trinary systems?

Could Earth-like (suitable for Human habitation) planets exist in systems with 2 or 3 suns, have any been found?
With more than a single star, isn't it likely that the habitation zone would be too irregular, gravitational forces be irregular/strong and numerous other issues?
