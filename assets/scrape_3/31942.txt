Why does the number of extrasolar planets vary in different sources?

There are at least three catalogues that are counting up-to-date discovered exoplanets. What criteria do they use to count the number of planets? Every catalogue has a different count value.
So at this moment various catalogues as:

exoplanet.eu
Open exoplanet catalogue
NASA exoplanet archive
etc.

show values of confirmed number of exoplanets between approx. 3500 and 4050.
Why do they disagree with each other?
