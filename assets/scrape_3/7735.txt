Do we get any benefit from being in a galaxy?

If our solar system were to somehow be created outside of a galaxy as a single star in the vast nothingness between galaxies, would life on Earth change any?
Does being a member of a galaxy actually provide some kind of benefit to our solar system or the creation/sustaining of life?
