What are the Gamma rays and Cosmic rays effects on humans and equipments?

First of all not to consider me a conspiracy theorist, but isn't landing on the moon a questionable issue? I am really not an expert in astronomy but let's assume that a moon landing has happened.
1- How would the Gamma rays and cosmic rays affect the equipments on the lunar surface and would these equipments function normally like on earth?
2-Could the enormous amounts of solar energy bursts be avoided somehow for protecting human flesh?
3-How is it possible for an FM or any kind of data transmission type be achieved in an environment that has nothing but an empty space? How would the electromagnetic waves travel and enter the earth's atmosphere to be captured by the receivers?
4-What is the bright lunar surface real temperature and is there a way to equip an astronaut to protect him from the over-heat?
Thanks for sharing any ideas that could explain these points not just for me, but for interested people who might view this question.
