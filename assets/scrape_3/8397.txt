What are the odds of (Semi) Intelligent Life in the Milky Way?

I know that it can vary A LOT if you are using the Drake Equation but using realistic figures, how likely is it to discover a civilisation that is at least semi-intelligent (stone age - medieval era, comparing to human history).
Also I heard that there are various classes of civilization:

Us (Humans), doesn't reach the energy milestones in the classes. (Level 0)
Controls 100% of the energy from their home planet (1,000 - 10,000 yrs away). (Level 1)
Controls 100% of the energy from their home star (5,000 - 20,000 yrs away). (Level 2)
Controls 100% of the energy from their local group of stars (never or 10,000 - 30,000 yrs away). (Level 3)
Controls 100% of the energy from their home galaxy (NEVER! just deal with it). (Level 4)

The last paragraph is NOT PART of the question; it is just for your knowledge!
