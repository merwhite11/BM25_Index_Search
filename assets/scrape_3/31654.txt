Where do local users of ALMA live and work?

These days with high speed internet, observational astronomy can be done from remote locations. Still I believe from time to time an experimenter might travel to work on-site for particularly challenging or unusual/non-standard observations, where working closely with the instrument support team is necessary.
When astronomers travel to the Atacama Large Millimeter Array or ALMA:

Where do they live?
Where do they work during observing sessions?

Representative photos would be greatly appreciated!
I'm guessing it looks a little different than this:
