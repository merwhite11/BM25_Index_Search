Unknown moving objects

Last night, I used my new Sony WX500 camera to get long exposure pictures of the sky from my backyard.  I used the "Heavens Above" app to find out when satellite flares would happen and I even got a great picture of the ISS passing overhead at roughly -2mag.  I was able to identify many flares that I had gotten pictures of when reviewing the pictures today.  However, this is where it gets odd.  
Some moving "things" didn't match what was supposed to show according to the app.  Some were accidentally caught in the pictures I took, and I'm sure there aren't any flares that the app showed me.  
What could they be?  Shooting stars?  Forgotten or broken satellites?
