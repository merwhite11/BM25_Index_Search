What direct or indirect observations of dust can one make by eye or with binoculars?

The solar system and space in general has plenty of dust, and dust has major impacts on observing both visually and in radio astronomy.
If I wanted to "see dust" in space, or see its effects, using my eyes or at most a pair of regular binoculars, where could I look and what would I look at in order to say to myself "yep, that's dust!" or a direct result of dust's properties in space?
NOTE: It doesn't necessarily have to be interstellar dust!
