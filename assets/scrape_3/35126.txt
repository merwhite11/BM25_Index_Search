Field rotation and observing the moon

For stars, field rotation can be accounted for with an equatorial mount aligned with the Earth's axis and turning at the correct rate.
Since the Moon's orbit is on a different axis then the Earth's rotation it seems like the Moon's own motion would also contribute to field rotation with respect to the observer. 
Is this correct? For instance, would pictures taken on a properly aligned equatorial mount still appear rotated to each other over time?
How would we find the field rotation due to this?
