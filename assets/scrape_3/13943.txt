Oxygen in a methane atmosphere akin to methane in oxygen atmosphere?

If we assume a planet the size of Earth with an equally dense atmosphere of nitrogen and methane, rather than oxygen, and it's in the goldilocks zone. Would a hypothetical alien species be able to use oxygen for lanterns and stoves the same way we use methane (or natural gas, etc)? 
If so, what primary differences in ratios and/or densities of gasses would have to exist? If not, why not?
