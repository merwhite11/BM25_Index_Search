Is there, in fact, any close-up photography of Saturn's rings, showing individual pebbles/rocks?

After reading this excellent but difficult answer, https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/18407/13071
I've been thinking how difficult it is to get a sense of the distance between and the size of typical items of dust, pebbles, rocks and/or anything else in Saturn's rings.
In short, have any photographs been taken by spacecraft, more or less "in" the rings, close enough to actually see individual dust, pebbles and/or rocks?
(As I understand it, the rings are on the order of 10m thick.  So I'm asking, have any photos been taken from that order of distance from the rings?  What's simply the closest viewpoint ever taken?)
Failing that, is there perhaps an artist's rendition somewhere of "what you'd see from 100m above the rings looking straight down at them?"  What would be in that frustrum - nothing?  Lots of fist-size rocks you could see? Or?
It's completely unclear to me if each (say) pebble-size piece is inches apart, meters apart, or for all I know 100s of km apart?
