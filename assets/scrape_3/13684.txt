Why is the detection of gravitational waves such a "Big" deal?

I'm a non-scientist. Today's announcement of LIGO's detection of GW waves has been heralded as "huge" â€“on the same level as the Higgs Boson detection. I realize this is the last remaining part of Einstein's theory of general relativity to be directly observed. Is that why it's such a big deal? Does this mean the theory is now on pace to become the  law of general relativity?
Side note: I had the privilege to visit and take a general tour LIGO in WA in 2000 or so and found it quite fascinating from a layman's pov. I've been waiting for this day ever since.
