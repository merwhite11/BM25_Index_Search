Looking for star database

I am looking for a particular set of information to essentially make a star map for a game.
What I need:

All stars within 11,462 light years of Earth.
Their stellar classification.
If they have any planets around them (hypothetical or otherwise)
Their position using an x, y, z coordinate relative to earth or
galaxy center (I don't really get declination, etc)


I need the extrapolated position/distance data, not the catalogs themselves.
The best one I can find is HYG, HabCat, and HYGHag is limited to to like 120,000 of 1,2 billion estimated stars... Are there any better?
