Is the moon inside earth’s atmosphere? If so, what are the consequences?

Recently, a paper was published claiming that the Earth’s atmosphere extends far beyond the Moon. This has been reported on by a number of news sources and websites, including the ESA, Business Insider, Space.com, and EarthSky.org.
If these findings are true, how does this affect the current understanding related to the measured atmospheric pressure, the currently accepted pressure in space between the Earth and the Moon, the pressure on the Moon, the effect of Earth's gravity on the atmosphere, and Earth's ability to maintain this extensive atmosphere while traveling through the Solar System? Is the atmosphere gradually lost or replenished?
