Orange light that rises quickly and moves of to the righ

I have recently noticed an orange "star" (or what I presume to be a star), rise above the hill line behind my home. It rises later than every other star and rises within a few hours while the other stars are stationary! It moves off to the right when half way in the night sky this happens every night when clear for the past few months. I also believe I'm looking south. It's really bugging me. Could anyone identify this object from my description?
