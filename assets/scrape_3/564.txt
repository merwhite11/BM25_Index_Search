Were effects of a planetary magnetic field reversal observed on other planets than Earth?

From geological records in rocks and minerals we know that the magnetic field of Earth changed its polarity multiple times in the history. See Geomagnetic reversal.
Was a similar process of a planetary magnetic field reversal observed on other planets?
I suppose that the record could be in rocks directly found on the planet (i.e. Mars), on its moons or in asteroids.
