Lunar eclipse above the atmosphere

Would a lunar eclipse seen from low (or even high) Earth orbit look different to the naked eye than it does from the surface of the Earth?
The only image I could find taken from orbit was the photo by Alexander Gerst from the ISS.  "The slight hue of blue is actually the Earth's atmosphere, just before the Moon is diving into it."
