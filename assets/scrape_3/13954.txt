Dish antenna as parabolic mirror for OPTICAL telescope?

Can I use a chrome painted dish TV antenna as a parabolic reflector for my optical telescope? Given that glass mirrors are quite expensive, I am thinking of using a Dish TV antenna and coating its reflecting surface with chrome paint to give it a mirror finish. But I couldn't find any instance of it online. I did find several examples of people using a dish antenna for making an amateur radio telescope.
I was wondering if there is a reason why we can't use it in optical telescope.
