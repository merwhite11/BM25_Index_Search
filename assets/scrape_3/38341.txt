Strange trail left by shooting star

I saw something really odd last night that I cannot understand.
Last night I got up around 3am to catch a glimpse of the upcoming Perseids meteor shower, now I know it's not peaking until next week but we have clear skies so I thought I'd take a look. I've seen hundreds of meteor showers, so know what to expect.
Whilst looking at another part of the sky a large shooting star radiated from the Perseus constellation, I just missed it! However, what was left in the sky was most odd, a really long dotted line of what looked like dust trail from the meteor. Usually, these trails stay where there are, and slowly fade away. But this trail didn't fade and very slowly moved across night the sky in an absolutely perfectly straight line until it faded into the horizon.
From the moment I first saw it to when it fully disappeared into the horizon was probably about 30 seconds or more. What did I see?
