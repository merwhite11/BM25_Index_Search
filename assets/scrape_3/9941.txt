What happens to a white dwarf past the Chandrasekhar limit?

This is a multiple choice question I had trouble with on an exam.
Will a white dwarf that has had too much mass piled on top of it
a) undergo a thermonuclear flash and explode in a type IA supernova
b) collapse to form a black hole
c) collapse to form a neutron star in a core collapse (type II) supernova
