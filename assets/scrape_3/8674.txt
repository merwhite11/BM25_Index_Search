Do objects look larger the further away they are, beyond z=1?

I stumbled upon this text which illustrates and says:

We find that as the object is moved to higher redshifts its angular
  size first decreases (as naively expected) but soon begins to increase
  after passing through a minimum value.

Is this correct for the mainstream standard model? What would an English language explanation be?
