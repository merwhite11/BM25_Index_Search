Simulate earth, moon, sun constellation with dates

I would like to simulate the three object distance, specifically the distance of the moon to both, sun and earth for further investigation into tide prediction. 
What would be a good starting point to browse?
Do any (preferably python) libraries exist for this?
My use is to query the function with a date and it would spit out the distance. 
A first model I would be happy to start with would be basic circular trajectories and expand to elliptical & inclinations from there.
