Do we know if there are asteroids leading or following Earth in Earth's orbit around the Sun?

A search of the Internet is so clouded with discussions about the asteroid belt or asteroids orbiting the planet Earth that I couldn't see an answer to my question.
Do we know if there are asteroids orbiting the Sun in Earth's orbit (NOT orbiting the Earth).
To be clear: these would be asteroids located somewhere around the Sun at the same distance as Earth, either following it or leading it in the Earth's own orbit around the Sun.
I hope that was clear.
