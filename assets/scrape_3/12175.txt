Is the time lapse considered when estimating the age of the universe?

We say that our universe is 13.7 billion years ago. During the big bang, it doubled at least 90 times in trillionth of a second (as given here), and other topological statements.
The question is which time are we talking about. Is the time-lapse considered? If yes, how?
