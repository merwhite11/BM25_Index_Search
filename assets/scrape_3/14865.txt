How come the northern and southern lights are the same?

Not an expert, hence the question. To my knowledge the magnetic field of the earth travels south to north. Wouldn't there be a bias on whether the charged particles causing the auroras are negatively or positively charged? If each pole attracts the opposite, how come they're the same?
