Could blackholes warping space-time create dark energy?

I think the effects of blackholes on the surrounding space is localised to a small area around the blackhole but I wondered if the largest blackholes at the centre of massive clusters could be a reason for the expansion of space?
If at the event horizon, space-time is compressed could this have a stretching effect on the space-time fabric within the voids between clusters? Again I dont really think this is the reason for the expansion rate to be increasing over time but as these central blackholes become larger and their effect on their local space-time becomes greater, it made me wonder if this could be what is stretching out the space between clusters giving the expansion of the universe?
