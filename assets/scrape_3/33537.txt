What would we notice if the Sun stopped fusing atoms?

(This question was stimulated by Would we have more than 8 minutes of light, if the sun "went out"?)
According to this answer, the "Sun has enough gravitational potential energy to supply its current luminosity for tens of millions of years."
Does "current luminosity" mean that the same spectrum will be radiated, or will it be just as bright, but radiating at different wavelengths (like not in the violet-blue and reddish orange-red wavelengths which chlorophyll requires, or the IR that keep us warm)?
