Why is Ganymede's aurora only visible in ultraviolet while Earth's is bright green and red?

NASA's Hubble Space Telescope observed a pair of auroral belts encircling the Jovian moon Ganymede. The belts were observed in ultraviolet light by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and are colored blue in this illustration.
