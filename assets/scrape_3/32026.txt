Planets may repel each other in few cases

We know that when two huge black holes collide they produces gravitational waves in space time curvature. So if I am not wrong another object in space if goes in that direction during production of waves then that huge black holes can push that object like star, sun, planet into opposite direction. So, indirectly, two objects in space can repel each other in a very few cases.
Is it also the case that two planets can repel each other in a few cases?
