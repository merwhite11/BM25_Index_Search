What process shaped Ultima Thule?

When I see this picture, I'm trying to understand how these two elements merged together and have two hypothesis :

two balls of lava in fusion together 
two solid rocks fused at their contact point 

But it appears that the collision speed was not particularly fast so I'm not sure in the end. 

What process likely formed Ultima Thule?
