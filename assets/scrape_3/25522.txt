"Esperance" rock on Mars formed by erosion or weathering? or is there any rock on Mars not formed by erosion?

I was wondering if the "Esperance" rock that was found on Mars by the Opportunity rover was formed due erosion or weathering? I have been reading a lot online but I did not seem to find anything. Does anyone know a type of rock on Mars that was not formed by erosion?
