Is a comet necessarily confined to the solar system?

I had the following question:

A comet enters the solar system. Assume that it is influenced only by the Sun, not by any of the planets. Which statement about its orbit is correct? 

And I chose as correct statement:

Its orbit might be an ellipse, or is might be a parabola or a hyperbola (because a comet is not necessarily confined to the solar system forever).

I want to know what it means by a comet is not necessarily confined to the solar system forever.
Does it mean that eventually the comet will "die" out, with the sun vaporizing all of its ice, so it will basically cease to exist while it is in the solar system?
Or does it mean that the comet can leave the solar system? If the comet enters the solar system it is subject to the mighty force of the suns gravity, then how can it escape?
