Term for altitude of the sun?

The sun travels in an arc across the sky. Where I live, during the summer the arc rises higher, but in the winter the arc is lower. Once might speak of highest altitude or elevation the sun reaches during any given day. In the old days this was called "high noon" when the sun had reached the highest point in the sky for that day. The town clock would be set to 12 at this point.
Is there a term for the elevation of the sun in the sky?
