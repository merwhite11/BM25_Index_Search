Existence of a "reflecting" star

Wasn't even sure about what the title should be, but I had a thought and I wonder whether it may be possible or not.
Is it possible that there is a star which acts as a mirror and reflects back the light almost as it was received?
My though is that if there is something like that and let's say that the star is far from earth 50 light years, than we could see 100 years back to the past.
