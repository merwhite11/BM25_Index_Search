What other “planetary formation mechanisms” exist beyond “gravitational collapse”?

My curiosity was pricked by the an edit made to this post: What's the distinction between "planetary formation mechanisms" and "gravitational collapse"? sadly the edit was changing the original questions intend, so I had to roll it back.
But the question of the edit itself felt interesting to me aswell, so I'm reposting it here in another question:
What "planetary formation mechanisms" other than "gravitational collapse" exist?
