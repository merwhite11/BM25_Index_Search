How complicated is the heating of meteors?

When any gas, including our atmosphere, is compressed, it's temperature rises.
When a meteor is falling through the atmosphere, it is compressing the air below it.
Because this makes the air hotter than the meteor, heat moves from the air to the meteor.
Also, some amount of oxidation (burning) might also take place.
What I would like to know, is it really that simple?
Alternatively, what else causes meteors to heat up?
I've heard people say "air friction," which sounds to me like nonsense, but I am not a rocket scientist, so what do I know?  If "air friction" is real I want to know how it works!
Also, I'm fairly certain that heating of air due to turbulence will only affect the air which the meteor has already moved through... not the meteor itself.  If I'm wrong, I want to know!
