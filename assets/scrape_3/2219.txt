Are satellites orbiting around earth visible to the naked eye?

I was just lying under the sky trying to possibly see some meteorites, unfortunately never seeing any I might add, but I saw three objects all moving at about the same speed( all at different times). They were far too faint and small to be aircraft or anything inside of the atmosphere I would think and there were no blinking lights. They were also moving fairly quickly it seemed. Could these have been satellites in low earth orbit? It's the only other thing I would think that they could be.
