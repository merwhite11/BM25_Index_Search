Looking at the Expanding Universe through the lens of relativity

The basis and most observable metric for how the universe is understood to be expanding at an accelerating rate is the red shift in observable light.  I am assuming it has been thought about or maybe it is just obviously wrong to people with more knowledge, but why can we not say the universe is technically always collapsing on itself under gravity's pull when considering relativity?
We know that space and time are affected by gravity so if we think in relative terms if everything is accelerating at an accelerating rate towards everything else this could explain the red shift (appearance of moving away). Things behind me would be accelerating slower towards the singularity things in front of us would be accelerating faster. Therefore relative to us it would actually look like it is all expanding at an accelerating rate, explaining the red shift.
In this very simplistic thinking, this would work for a universe that expands and contracts or is in a never ending state of contraction, which relative to us could go on infinitely since time and space is all intertwined with gravity.
