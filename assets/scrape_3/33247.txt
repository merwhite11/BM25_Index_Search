Strange object crossing the sky

Was stargazing last night and spotted an object traversing the sky from roughly East to West. It had a bright light that was intermittently flashing but with three different intensities. The "third" flash was really bright like a camera flash. Never seen a plane with lights this bright and was not a satellite (like any that I've ever seen), nor was it the ISS as that was not in this part of the world at this time. Any ideas anyone?
