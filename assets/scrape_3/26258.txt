How many (or percentage) satellites of Solar system planets have their orbits synchronized like the Moon (always facing earth)?

Mercury and Venus have no satellites. Then earth has moon (synchronized orbit). For Mars - both its satellites (Fobos and Deimos) also synchronized. Analyzing other planets is hard - too many satellites. Maybe someone knows percentage - all of them synchronized or which ones are not synchronized (if just a few ones are not synchronized). All 4 largest Jupiter satellites are also synchronized.
