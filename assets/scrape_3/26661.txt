Can a black hole be torn apart by SMBHs?

Suppose two SMBHs (supermassive black holes) are brought close (e.g. during a galactic merger).
Suppose that a "normal" black hole drifts into the space between the SMBHs.
Could the gravitational pull of the SMBHs be sufficient to tear the normal black hole to pieces?
If so, will we be able to examine the fragments, free from being obscured by the black hole's event horizon?
