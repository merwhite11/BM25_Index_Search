Does the accelerating expansion of spacetime mean that the pace of time is changing?

Space expands everywhere, also here. And time is inseparable from space. Does this mean that time also "expands" as in changing its pace? Is the changing rate of time also astronomically observable? How did time behave during the radical inflation shortly after Big Bang?
