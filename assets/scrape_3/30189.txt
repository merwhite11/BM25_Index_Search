Compare this planet to Earth and determined its habitability (can humans live in this environment?)

I'm given this set of data and I need to describe the habitability. Would this not be habitable since the temperature of the albedo and the equilibrium is similar to Earth's or does the Spectral Type M affect the planet that much?
