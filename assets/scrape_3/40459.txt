Minimum distance between planets

In our solar system, MOIDs (minimum orbital intersection distance) of different planets reach a minimum of ~30 million miles (Mercury and Venus). However, other star systems have more compact planets. So I am wondering, what is the absolute minimum for planets of different sizes (list below)

1 Earth mass
5 Earth masses
10 Earth masses (Neptune-sized)
50 Earth masses (Super-Neptune)
100 Earth masses or 0.3 Jupiter mass (Sub-Jupiter)
1 Jupiter mass
5 Jupiter masses

P.S. Sorry if the list is too big, some can be omitted for sake of writing all of that.
