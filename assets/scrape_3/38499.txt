Which star has the lowest absolute magnitude?

I have seen many lists of stars with the most luminosity, mass, and temperature, but I have never seen one that is about absolute magnitude. So I'm wondering, which star has the lowest absolute magnitude (in other words, which star is the brightest when a viewer is 10 pc away)?
