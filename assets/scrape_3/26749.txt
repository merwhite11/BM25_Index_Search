Say we were to bring Titan to Earth's orbit. How much would its atmospheric pressure change?

I've heard one of the reason why Titan has such a thick atmosphere is because of its really low temperature. So say that were were to magically bring Titan to the Same orbit as Earth, and the moon starts to rapidly heating up. How much of its atmosphere would it lose? Would we still be able to stand there without a pressurized suit? Is it possible to terraform Titan to the extent that we can heat up its surface while still retaining its thick atmosphere? 
Thanks
