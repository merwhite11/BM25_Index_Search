Instead of using flexible mirrors, could software be used for adaptive optics?

Telescopes that use adaptive optics now use flexible mirrors to adjust for distortions in the atmosphere.  The mirrors are flexed in real time to account for the distortions.  I am wondering if it would be feasible to instead use fixed mirrors and use software to make the needed corrections to the image?
