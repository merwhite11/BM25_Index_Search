Does the average person in China know the constellations by the traditional Chinese system or Hellenic designation

As discussed in the International Dunhuang Project website, in traditional Chinese astronomy "the Chinese sky was divided into five great regions or palaces called gong хол," and "Chinese astronomers identified twenty-eight segments in the sky known as mansions" with "each of the four directions contains seven of the twenty-eight mansions and together with the central region of the sky." 

These do not directly correspond to the Hellenistic constellations familiar throughout Western culture.
Has the curriculum in China been nationally standardized so that the traditional Chinese astronomy designations is taught and the Hellenistic constellations is not.
