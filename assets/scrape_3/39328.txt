Do celestial objects need to be big to have liquid water on their surfaces?

I mean no asteroid, planetoid that I am aware of has water on its surface. It is way more common to see ice in it. So I figured that the size of the celestial body has something to do with the cycle of water. Does this theory hold true? Do exoplanets with water have to be similar size than Earth? To have water does it has to be a rocky planet?
I mean some moons have water inside their crust (I think). Some planets seem to have had water before, like Mars.
