Sunrise - from earth - sun position or when sun rays reaches earth?

Time for the sun rays to reach earth is approximately 8 mins. 
If time of the sun rise is 7:30 - which time is this? Time when sun rays reaches earth or time when earth and sun comes into correct position where sun is visible again after night?
If it is time when sun rays reaching earth - that means sun is already 8 mins away from that first position.
If it is second option - it means it's still 8 mins to wait until we actually see 'sun rising' - sun rays reaching earth.
So which time sun rise really is?
