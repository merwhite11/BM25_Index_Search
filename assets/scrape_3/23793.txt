When would Oumuamua have entered the solar system?

So from what I've read, Oumuamua travels at around 26km/s when in interstellar space.
I also remember reading a while back that Voyager was travelling at around 18km/s when leaving the solar system.
Seeing as Voyager took around 35 years (I think) to exit the solar system, I'd guess that Oumuamua entered our solar system around 20â€“25 years or so ago?
