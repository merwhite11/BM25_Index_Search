Why are stars still distant from one another?

Why are stars so far from each other? Shouldn't gravity pull them closer over time? And if the effects of gravity are negligible is there an explanation why stars have to be so distant from one another?
The closest star is Alpha Centauri (I think) and it is 4.4 light years away.
