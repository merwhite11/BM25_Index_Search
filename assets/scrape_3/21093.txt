Mass of quantum fluctuations in space?

I have no formal training in physics, just a casual interest, so if this question doesn't make sense i would love to understand why.
I know from casual physics talks etc that pairs of particles pop in and out of existence due to fluctuations in the underlying relevant field.
Does that mean that for every instant there is an extra amount of mass per unit of space equal to the massive 'fluctuation' particles that still did not pop out of existence/annihilate?
If that holds true has anyone measured it or calculated it?
