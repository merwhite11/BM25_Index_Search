Does the astrology of constellations relate to its position during the year?

For example, pisces birthdays are from Febuary 19th-March 20th. Would the sun be near or at the pisces constellation during Mid febuary to mid march? Basically, I was wondering whether the astrology we use now is related to the sun's position relative to the zodaic constellations.
