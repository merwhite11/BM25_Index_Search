Can we observe what objects exist at the L3 positiion of planets of our solar system?

From what I understand Earth's L3 is obscured by the Sun, so is that true for our viewpoint of the other planets? Or, are there times when other planets are on the other side of the Sun from Earth and we can see their L3 position? For the Hilda's of Jupiter have we observed them in that position or is it that we have calculated their coordinates to be in the L3 position?
