What would be the sizes of the bodies created from Jupiter's trojans?

If all trojans from the Greek camp and all the trojans of the Trojan camp were combined into two bodies respectively, what sizes and masses these bodies would have? Would they qualify as dwarf planets? Would they be greater than Ceres?
