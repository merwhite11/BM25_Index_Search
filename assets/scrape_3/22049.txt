When it was discovered that the classical planet are not stars?

The classical planets (Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) were considered to be "wandering stars" - and the word "planet" means just that.
Wikipedia says "By the 17th century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers."
Since the planets were considered stars in those times, the question is when did the astronomers realize that they are something else?
The same question in put in another words: When did the scientists first hypothesize that the planets do not emit their own light, like stars, and they just reflect the star from the sun? And when was that proven for the first time?
