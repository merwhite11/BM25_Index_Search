Knowing the RA/DEC of a star how do I locate a star from ground?

Standing in Melbourne at 4 am in the morning on 14th April 2019,  Sirus RA = 06h 45m 08.9s, Dec = -16Â° 42' 58"..How do I Locate this. Standing facing east I turn myself towards south approx 90 Deg and then look up about 16 Deg, I do not find any star.
