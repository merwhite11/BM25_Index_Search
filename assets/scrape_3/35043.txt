What book(s) should I read to get started learning about astronomy?

I'm an undergrad software engineer but I also love physics and math. I'm starting to get going in AI/Machine Learning techniques and I'm going to use NASA data-sets to conduct analysis. However, I am not really acquainted with the pieces that make up the universe. This is a GIANT problem for me! I could browse wikipedia for hours but I don't think that would fit well with my way of learning in a linear fashion. I do not have any background in astronomy, so:
I realize this is probably a bit hard to answer but what book(s) should I read first? What should I read after that? What about after that etc...?
I love learning and am more than prepared to take the time to work my way through them. Thank you in advance!
