Why can't we determine the center of the universe

I find this baffling. If we can observe objects moving away from us and each other, than it stands to reason that we can track their paths (relative to each other and ourselves) backward to find a point of origin. In this question answers given suggest that there is no center of the universe. I'm looking for clarification as to why we cannot reverse engineer (to some degree) where this point of origin exists, even if a simple general direction relative to us. I understand that paths may be distorted and skewed by forces as time goes on, but I still don't grasp the concept that we have no way to determine a point of origin or general sense thereof. Help wrapping my inferior brain around this is much appreciated.
