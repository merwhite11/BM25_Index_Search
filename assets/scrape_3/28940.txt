How did they make a video of the center of the galaxy, and what is it exactly that's flashing there?

The ESA video ESOcast 173: First Successful Test of Einsteinâ€™s General Relativity Near Supermassive Black Hole includes a clip of images of stars at the center of our galaxy orbiting around SgrA*, a presumed supermassive black hole. This isn't visible light because it's obscured by dust, so it may be radio or long wave infrared, but I don't know.
In the middle, I can see something flashing at whatever wavelength this image has been produced from.
Question: 

How are these images obtained, and
what process is it that is believed to be causing that flashing?
