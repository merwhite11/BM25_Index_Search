Are the most distant known objects in the universe more than 14 billion light years away?

When I hear about the most distant objects in the universe, such as the recently discovered galaxy GN-z11, their distances are usually stated to be a little under 14 billion light years away....
But, the observable universe is 46.5 billion light years in radius... So..
Does the 13.4 billion light years or so distance for GN-z11 factor out the expansion of the universe itself?  So-called 'co-moving distance'?  Or is it actually, currently about 13.4 billion light years away?
