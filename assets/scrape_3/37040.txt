Can any satellite train still be seen?

I "missed the train" on the Starlink satellites last year, and now it looks like they've separated, and the conservative voices convinced Space X to darken new ones with visors or paint.
Is it still possible to see 2 or more satellites moving in the same direction with the naked eye? (Actually, any celestial bodies visibly moving in the same direction will do.)
I'm located in California and I tried Find Starlink and the Heavens Above app but wasn't able to see anything.
