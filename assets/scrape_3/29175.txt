Why is it that night has a almost a bluish tint to it instead of red?

From my understanding/been told, the color red has the ability to travel the farthest in our atmosphere, being the reason why we have red sunsets and such. But with this in mind, why is it that at night the moonlight we receive seems to have a slight blue tint to it, and since red can travel the best out of our visible spectrum, how come our moonlit nights don't have a red tint instead of a blue one?
