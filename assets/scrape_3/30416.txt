Did the Moon ever approximate a geosynchronous orbit above the early Earth?

Simulations suggest the early Moon formed about 20,000 to 30,000 km away from Earth which is less than the current geosynchronous orbit of 42,164 km.  The Moon is now 384,000 km away from Earth.  Does that mean the moon approximated a geosynchronous orbit for a time on its journey outward to its current orbit?  I recognize because of the Earth's tilt of 6.7 degrees the Moon does not orbit around the Earth's equator and therefore a geostationary orbit wasn't possible.
If the early Earth was a water world covered almost entirely with water at the time it formed, what would happen when the Moon approached geosynchronous orbit and applied its much more amplified gravitational force upon the Earth?  Would there be tidal bulges of water at both ends exposing land at the polar regions or would the water eventually make its way toward the Moon side possibly exposing or making a bulge of land at the opposite end of the Earth?
