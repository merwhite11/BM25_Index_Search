Is it possible to do moon sighting in advance for 5 years with 100% accuracy?

It is Ramzan and the usual heated disagreements between clerics here in Pakistan as to the sighting of the crescent. This time the minister of Science and Technology (who is not a scientist himself btw) has intervened and formed a committee comprising of meteorologists and our space agency. This committee is tasked to form a 5 year lunar calendar, specially one that will fix the issue of moon sighting of major religious months and events such a Ramzan, Hajj (pilgrimage), Eids etc.
My question is that: Is it scientifically possible to predict (simulate...) in future with 100% accuracy as to the location of the moon? My surface reading of Lyapunov time suggests that the solar system can be predicted with accuracy for 5 million years.
I would like to know your understand on this matter.
Also some commenters mentioned that this question might be a duplicate of an other one. I would like to add that there are school of thoughts and in one the condition is that the crescent is to be observed from the surface of the Earth. So I think this question is unique in that sense that it includes that component too.
