How to build a powerful home made telescope

Simple, I fell in love with the sky when my parents were constructing our new house I was a kid then and one day I ventured out on the terrace, to my amazement it was a full moon, ever since I've felt spiritually connected with the Universe. Its been around 20 years since that day, out of my busy schedule I looked at the stars yesterday, I found love again! Wanted to buy the best telescope out there, but its out of my pocket. 
Want to build a home made powerful telescope? Any help fellow sky lovers and star chasers?
