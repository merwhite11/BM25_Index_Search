How was the hypothetical ninth planet kicked so far out of the Solar System?

I was reading this article on science news and ran into the following statement:

Such a remote super-Earth probably originated closer to the sun only to be kicked out by the other giant planets during the solar systemâ€™s formative years, Batygin and Brown suggest. 

I was wondering, how was this planet kicked so far out of the Solar System? 
Why only one planet?
