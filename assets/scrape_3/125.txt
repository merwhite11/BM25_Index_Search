What are the Earth-like features of Titan?

This NASA site says that hidden beneath the smog of Titan are Cirrus like clouds and This space article describes how Titan's atmosphere is similar to Earth's too. 
What other features does Titan boast that make scientists so ready to boast that "Titan may well be the most Earth like planet we know of besides Earth itself"? (paraphrased)
Answers should focus on the features of Titan itself, obviously a similarity is that it orbits the same Sun, but this type of thing is not what I'm after. I am mainly searching for geological or atmospheric similarities that Titan shares all the way down to potential similarities in the composition and flow of the planetary core.
