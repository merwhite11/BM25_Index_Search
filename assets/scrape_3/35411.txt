Binary planet orbital distance

From reading various sources online, I see that some people talk about binary planets in very tight orbits (around 1 or 2 planet radii). I am wondering if it is possible for a binary planet (Double planet) system to exist at a much greater distance from eachother.
Setup: Binary planets orbit their star at 1.19AU. Planet 1 is 1.254 Earth masses and planet 2 is 0.8087 Earth masses. They orbit eachother with a apoapsis of 750,600km and a periapsis of 742,500km. 
According to calculations, they are within the sweet spot of each other's hill sphere and of course far from the Roche limit. 
Bonus info to further complicate the situation, the star system is a binary star system, Alpha Centauri. The planets orbit the A star and are well within the stable orbital region of that star and should theoretically not be majorly affected by the B star.
Is this a stable planetary system? Any reasons why it wouldn't work would be great.
