What is the effect of this expanding universe on the energy density of it?

We know that our universe is expanding i.e.  volume of the universe is getting larger with time with total energy being conserved. My question is whether the energy density is getting smaller with time.
If this is true then what is the effect of this phenomenon on all the celestial bodies?
