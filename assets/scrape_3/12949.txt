Is the sphere of influence of our milky way's center super massive black hole same as the Milky way's radius?

The sphere of influence is a region around a supermassive black hole in which the gravitational potential of the black hole dominates the gravitational potential of the host galaxy(found it in wiki). So is it the same? If not, what holds the milky way together?
