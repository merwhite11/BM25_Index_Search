Canvas and bowling ball

I'm having trouble understanding the basic model for how matter bends space. The classic illustration is the canvas and the ball but that model needs a reference frame where one can define a downward direction to work. For the life of me I can't figure out why matter just doesn't "sit" in space.
I'm sorry this question isn't better formulated, maybe someone can point me towards a video or something?
