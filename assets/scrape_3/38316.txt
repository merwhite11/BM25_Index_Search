Trying to use Canon 60D DSLR with Skywatcher 130P. Can't focus image

I have a Skywatcher Heritage 130P FlexTube Dobsonian Telescope. It works well, I can see lovely stars, planets, moons of Jupiter etc.  It came with two eye pieces (1.25 inch): 10 mm and 25 mm.
I also have a Canon 60D camera.
I've been trying to attach the camera to the telescope using a Celestron 93640 1.25 Inch Universal Barlow and T-Adaptor which I originally bought for a Celestron Travelscope.
I have never been able to get any kind of decent image out of the camera when attached to either  telescope. Am I doing something daft? (This is all new to me).
Steps I take:

Set up and focus the Skywatcher scope on some nice stars using the 25mm eye piece.
Remove the eyepiece.
Insert the camera with Barlow and T ring where the eye piece was.
Diddle around with the focus. Try and take some photos. Get nothing remotely in focus, not ever a blurry star.

I suspect I have the same issue as described in Astrophotography - Unable to achieve focus with current setup If so, please could someone advise the adapter I would need for the combination of camera and scope I have? I'd prefer to use the DSLR than buy a digital camera if possible. (Many thanks, and sorry if this is a daft question.)
