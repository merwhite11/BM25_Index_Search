What would happen if a planet is removed from the solar system?

More exactly what would to happen to us/Earth in general if any of the gas giants is removed by magic from the solar system ?
How long would it take after such change before we notice it ?
How major and would life resist to it ?
EDIT
For instance if Saturn or Jupiter is removed, what would happen ?
