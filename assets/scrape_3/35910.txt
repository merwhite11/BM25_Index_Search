What kind of halo is this?

My friend sent me a video of a kind of a halo phenomenon and asked me what kind of halo it is.
There is a 22 degree circular halo around the sun.
But there is also a ring which seems to go horizontally around the entire sky. The ring is the same height as the sun. It seems to start and end where the 22 halo is at the same height as the sun (3 and 9 o'clock on the halo) and goes horizontally around the sky.
