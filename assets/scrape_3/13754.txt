Why can't different regions of the universe be the same as they have the same origin?

The horizon problem states that because of the speed of information can't be faster than light and the distances between far regions are too big there is a problem because they look quite the same. Therefor, the inflation is introduced. 
But what I don't understand is why those regions can't be the same without inflation or something like that? They have the same origin and the universe was in the beginning too empty to make a difference for the direction you went. So in my simple understanding, it is rather expected that they should be the same but why are cosmologists think different about that?
