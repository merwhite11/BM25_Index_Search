Astrochemistry - what does freeze-out mean?

I was recently watching a video on the physics and chemistry in planetary accretion disks, and the speaker at a certain point mentioned 'freeze-out and UV dissociation'. Is freeze-out a purely chemical term, or is it specific for this process? Is it very important in planetary formation?
