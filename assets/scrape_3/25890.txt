How did TESS scientists choose which stars to observe at a "2 minute cadence" in each field?

The BBC news podcast Science in Action episode New Planet Hunting Mission covers the upcoming TESS mission between 01:00 and 07:15 with Sara Seager, TESS deputy director of science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
After about 05:00 Dr. Seager mentions that the TESS spacecraft will measure a special set of order 20,000 stars in each camera's 24x24 degree field at a two minute cadence. 
How were the stars in each field selected for TESS?

The excellent YouTube video Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) nicely explains how TESS operates and will slowly tile the celestial sphere.
