Did we ever actually see the earth revolving around the sun? Is the geocentric model completely disproved?

Did we ever actually see the Earth revolving around the Sun?
Also, is the geocentric model completely disproved or was it sidelined because the heliocentric model made things easier to understand? 
(BTW I know Earth revolves around the Sun and am just asking out of curiosity.)
Thanks!
