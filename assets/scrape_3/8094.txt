Likelihood of a stable system with a dwarf planet's orbit inside that of a gas giant

I keep thinking of various planetary system configurations, and would like to know:

What are the fundamental references based on Monte Carlo long-term simulation of planetary systems' evolution that put testable restrictions on the distribution of stable configurations around Sol-like stars (books, papers, software packages)?
How rare is the configuration wherein a dwarf planet (Ceres, I'm looking at you) is located in the inner system?

The main question is the first one, in the vein of "teach a man to fish...".

Related Q&A's here that do not answer my question:

 Is there a upper limit to the number of planets orbiting a star?
 Can you explain the pattern of Hill sphere sizes of the objects of the Solar system?
Could a habitable satellite of a gas giant have a stable subsatellite?
