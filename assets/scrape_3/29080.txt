If we had the right technology could we see a distant star in detail?

If, for instance, Hubble's camera was a $10^{300}$ times better, could it see a distant star in details, or is there a limit to the amount of light that reaches the Earth's orbit or perhaps does the light get distorted on its way so you must come closer?
Is there a limit to the number of light beams that hit a telescope camera's "eye" or if you built a huge telescope would you then be able to see that distant star in high detail (for instance, see an earth size satellite around Betelgeuse's orbit).
