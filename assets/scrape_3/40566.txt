Why is the Kuiper belt called like this?

Since most orbits of KBOs are highly inclined, isn't it rather a "Kuiper cloud"? Most main belt objects are also more inclined than the eight recognized planets, but not as much as KBOs (and bodies beyond) which can orbit above the Sun's poles. Why isn't it called the Kuiper cloud then? Is it due to historical reasons (because the first discovered KBOs such as Pluto weren't as inclined as Eris for instance)?
