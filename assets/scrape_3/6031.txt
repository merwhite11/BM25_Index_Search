Can there be an infinity of humans in the Universe?

I was reading this question about if the number of stars can or cannot be infinite.
The answer to this question is: 
"if the universe is considered infinite, the number of stars can be infinite, otherwise not."

So, I came across a mental problem: If the universe is considered infinite, and therefore we can consider that the number of stars is too, then, we can consider that the number of humans (example) is also infinite, or the number of anything is also infinite?
If the answer is No, please describe why u think this is not a real affirmation.
