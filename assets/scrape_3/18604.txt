Multiple Star-system percentages

What are the percentages of systems that have x number of stars in them?
What I have found thus far is something like:

Single Star Sytems = 69%
Double Star Systems = ~10%
Triple Star Systems = <20% 
Quadruple Star Systems = ???
Quintuple Star Systems = ???
Sextuple Star Systems = ???
Septuple Star Systems = ???

Also... Is there any way to get these percentages for systems that have primaries that are Giants (more than 2 Solar Masses) Major Stars (0.5 to 2 Solar Masses), and Minor Stars (0.5 Solar Masses... red dwarfs)
I have found an article that says...
Giant Stars = 80% have companions
Major Stars = 50% have companions
Minor Stars = 25% have companions
