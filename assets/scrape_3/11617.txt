Stellarium 0.10.4: planet orbits change over time?

If I draw the orbit of Mars in stellarium 0.10.4 for 23 Sep 2015, it passes south of Chi Leonis:

If I advance the date to 17 Oct 2015, however, the orbit of Mars correctly goes right through Chi Leonis (Mars will occult Chi Leonis on 18 Oct 2015):

Is this a known bug in 0.10.4 that's been fixed? (I unfortunately can't upgrade)
