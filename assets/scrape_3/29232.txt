What was the process of calculating how much darkmatter/matter/dark energy the observable universe consists of and how did it come at this conclusion

In 2015 the Planck satellite consortium released an analysis of data collected by the Planck satellite that showed this percentage break down of the universeâ€™s mass/energy.
Ordinary matter: 4.9%
Dark Matter: 26.8%,
Dark Energy: 68.3%
How did they calculate the "stuff" of the observable universe and how did they come to this conclusion?
I assume  this took some tough calculations and some work with a supercomputer but i wonder what the entire process was.
