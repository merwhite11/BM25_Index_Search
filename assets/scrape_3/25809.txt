Is there a comfortable part of Venus's upper atmosphere?

I know the surface of Venus is very hot, but that it gets cooler the higher you go in the atmosphere.  I have heard that there is a section in the atmosphere of Venus that might be somewhat habitable even, that where it is about 1 atmosphere, the temperature is slightly over 100 F.  Not really comfortable, but possibly livable temperature wise (likely with some cooling mechanism).  However, I recently heard that near the poles, the atmosphere is extremely cold: http://www.iflscience.com/space/death-plunge-venus-spacecraft-reveals-hottest-planet-not-so-hot/
Does this mean that at the height where the atmospheric pressure is 1 atmosphere, and somewhere between the pole and the equator would lie a comfortable zone of 72 F?  "Extra credit" for suggesting / providing reasoning for a likely latitude where this condition would exist (if it does).  If this does exist, it might make an ideal place for a blimp like sky colony.  I am considering adding this to my Planetary Settlers video game.
