Black Hole / Hawking Radiation: Why only capture anti-particle?

I may have some specifics wrong here.  If so, don't focus on those.  Just focus on the general thrust of my question.
I "understand" (cough) that particle/anti-particle pairs form spontaneously in space.  I understand that they can form near the event horizon of a black hole, and that one particle can fall in, where as the other particle can barely escape.  I understand that an anti-particle will annihilate with a particle.  What I don't understand is why only the anti-particles of these virtual particle pairs fall into the black hole, while the other ones just manage to escape.  Shouldn't both particle and anti-particle have equal chance to be the one to fall in, or just manage to escape?
It seems that there should be an equal chance of either the particle, or the anti-particle, would be captured while the other "ejected."  So it seems that the black hole should be somewhat steady-state as far as mass change with respect to virtual particles.
Explain?
