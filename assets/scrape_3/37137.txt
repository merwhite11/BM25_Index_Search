Would Europa be an ocean planet if it were in the habitable zone?

If a Europa-like body were in the Sun's habitable zone, let's say in an orbit between Earth and Mars, would the body become and remain a water ocean planet? In the habitable zone, the Sun would warm up and melt Europa's icy surface which will first turn into water vapor because Europa has no atmosphere, but the water vapor might form an atmosphere around Europa (which would contain oxygen as well) and eventually Europa might get a liquid water surface. Would that be possible? And would the atmosphere remain or couldn't it remain due to Europa's low gravity? But what if the Europa-like body had a Mars-like gravity and/or an Earth-like magnetosphere?
