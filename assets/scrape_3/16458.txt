Has NASA confirmed earth now has a second moon orbiting the planet?

Several sites claim NASA has confirmed a second moon orbiting earth. This is the Asteroid 2016 HO3. One source states The newfound quasi-satellite/moon-2016 HO3, is likely larger than 120 feet (40 m) and smaller than 300 feet (100 m).

Question
Is this claim true circling the internet and can anyone post a link from NASAs offical web site to conclude this is true?
