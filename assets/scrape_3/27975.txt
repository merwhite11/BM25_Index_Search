Why are there optical differences between sunrise and sunset?

I've noticed that sunrises are not reverse sunsets regarding the sky hues and lighting.
Sunrises always start pinkish and end with a glorious yellow sunshine.
On the other hand as the sun sets lighting gets orange and the sky gets a hellish red colour. I've noticed this many times regardless the weather or temperture.
Why is this contrast between colors (pastel-like in the morning vs vivid in the evening) in a fenomenon that should be same in both instances in a day ?
Am I the only one that perceives this difference ?
