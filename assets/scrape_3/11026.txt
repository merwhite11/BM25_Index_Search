How do we convert other waves of the EMS to visible light?

So I just had a quick question and I was wondering how we convert other waves of the electromagnetic spectrum to visible light waves. For example we use X-ray's or radio waves to see things in space like nebulae that we wouldn't normally be able to see with just visible light waves. But how do we convert those waves to visible light so we can actually see them.  I don't know if I'm staying this right but another example that just came to me is pictures of the Sun we see that was taken with radio waves, we see them,  which must mean that they were covered into visible light some how, so I was just wondering how, thanks in return =)
