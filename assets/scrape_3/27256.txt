Why can’t I see any detail on planets?

I really want to know why I can’t see detail on planets.
This summer my Dad and I went on a trip to Utah I went outside to look at the planets and couldn’t see detail on Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter. Saturn's rings were visible but very faint and Jupiter was a white ball and then it’s four moons, this was all out in the middle of nowhere with 0 light pollution at 6000ft. 
We then went into Bryce Canyon at 9100ft and still the same outcome the only difference was a very very faint strip on Jupiter, and it’s so dry in Utah and at an altitude of 9100ft where the atmosphere is not as heavy. 
Is there still dew? Is my telescope not powerful enough I have an Astromaster 130 reflector and a 60az explorerscope refractor. I’m very confused
