Astrophotography - Unable to achieve focus with current setup

I am new to astrophotography and am looking for guidance. I have the following equipment:

Orion StarBlast 9814 4.5" Altazimuth Reflector Tabletop telescope
1.25in Telescope Adapter Extension Tube T Ring for Canon DSLR SLR Camera DC618
17mm and 6mm lenses

When I use the lenses in the Telescope Adapter Extension, focus is not achievable. My theory is that the focal plane of most DSLR are 55mm back focus plane. Reflectors are positioned farther back than where the human eye would normally be placed, and hence it is usually difficult if not impossible to bring the camera into focus.
Is this true? Also, would a Barlow lens help achieve focus or be a waste of money? Any other suggestions?
