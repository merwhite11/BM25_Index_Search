What day/night cycles, climate and seasons would experience Alpha Centauri Bb inhabitants?

Alpha Centauri Bb is an exoplanet orbiting Alpha Centauri B. It is asserted that given the close distance to the star the planet should be tidally locked. 
The orbiting period of the planet is about 3.2 days.
If the planet has no atmosphere (which is very possible due to proximity to the star), its dark side should experience low temperatures like permanently-shadowed areas of Mercury do.
At the same time the planet is about 11 AU from the other star, Alpha Centauri A.
This possibly means that the planet should experience quasi-day/night cycle each 3.2 days.
My questions are:

To what temperatures the dark surface of such planet could be heated? Is there possibility of liquid water?
Will the radiation of the second star be enough to provide normal day-like illumination and heating?
Will the calendar on such a planet differ sufficiently from a calendar of a planet that experiences day/night cycles from the nearest star?
Will such planet experience seasons and how they would be arranged?
