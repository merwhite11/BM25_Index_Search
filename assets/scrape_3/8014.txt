As of now did a radio telescope ever recorded something else than the silence of space?

When a radio telescope listen to the Universe; a constant sound is recorded. Is it the noise "of the mic" : interferences? Scientists says that when they will notice variations on this basic constant same noise I call "the interference coming from the mic" they will conclude on an extra terrestrial source of sound; but in fact if is waves that are "listen" to. So, any news?
