Are there other proofs of the expanding universe apart from the redshift?

The theory of the expanding universe is so widely accepted, that the redshift is sometimes used as a measure of distance to far away galaxies.
But is it still possible that the redshift is caused by some unknown phenomena and not by galaxies moving away from each other?
Is there any other proof (apart from the redshift) that the universe is indeed expanding and far away galaxies are moving away from us?
