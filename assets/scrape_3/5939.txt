How massive does a planet need to be to create gravitational lensing?

Is it ever possible for starlight to be distorted in a noticeable way from something as small as a planet? 
I'm guessing that the chances of this working are better on a dense terrestrial planet than a gas giant.
How do you calculate this?
Edit: I was unclear, sorry. I'm specifically thinking about lensing that would distort the shape of a star, not just move its position.
