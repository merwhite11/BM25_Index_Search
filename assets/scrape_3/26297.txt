Is it possible to image a meteor so the rock is visible?

I was wondering what one would see if they were to look through a telescope tracking a meteor as it shot through the sky. Technology aside, would one be able to see the object tumbling or would it always be obscured by the light/dust/plasma?
Basically would there be any advantage to getting a high shutter-speed video with high magnification tracking the leading edge of a meteor or would it not offer any greater detail than just a bright streak in the sky?
