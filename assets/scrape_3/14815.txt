Intuitive explanation for why the universe is flat

I went through Prof. Hitoshi Murayama's online lecture where he describes why the universe is flat. One of the evidences for a flat universe is the evenness of CMB radiation on all directions. My understanding is, that a uniform CMB pattern only indicates that inflation or early expansion of the universe was more or less equal on all directions. Why is this cited for the claim that the universe is flat, or in what sense is the universe 'flat'?
