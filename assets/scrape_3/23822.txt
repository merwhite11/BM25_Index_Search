Does Flat Universe mean even distribution?

I've read through all the other related answers to "flatness" questions but I need a bit more clarification.
I understand that a triangle in a 2D universe would not equal 180 degrees in both a closed and open universe. If I am correct, not being flat during the initial conditions would mean exponential expansion or collapse as time went by.
Given the above, could we explain flatness as uniform density of the universe, meaning all of the universe is the same approximate "consistency" on a large scale (homogeneity).
