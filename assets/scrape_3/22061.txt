Is the sun any brighter during a solar eclipse

I keep hearing that you can go blind during a solar eclipse. 
Is the sun actually any brighter during a solar eclipse? This is how the media seems to frame it, and they suggest you need special glasses to view the eclipse.
But after some reading, it seems that the warning is about just not staring at the sun in general, and there is nothing special about the eclipse.
Is this the case?
