Any information on the salt content of Mars' atmospheric dust?

Answers to and comments on How to drink water on Mars? suggest that one would not want to drink melted water ice obtained from exposed surface deposits near the poles because it may contain various salts and other dangerous chemicals (perchlorate salts are one particularly nasty suspected component of mars soil and it's water content).
Mars' atmosphere contains dust even when there are no dust storms, and in this answer it is explained to be the cause of the reddish color of the Martian sky as has been photographed by several Mars landers and rovers.
Are there any measurements or even models or predictions on how much of the particulate matter in Mars' atmosphere could be tiny particles of salt, or salt mixed with other minerals? Put more simply, how salty might Mars' atmosphere be?
