Can our Sun become a black hole

Does every star become a black hole? Is there any probability that our sun can become a black hole? If yes then is it on its way to become a black hole? what is the current state of sun as per the black hole life cycle? What will be the effect on all the planetary objects in the solar system if the sun turns into a black hole.
Sorry for so many questions but i cannot miss them as these are some questions on my mind.
