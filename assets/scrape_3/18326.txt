The Hollow Moon Story

I've heard on various programs (yes TV) with "supposed" experts in various fields that there is evidence which would suggest that the moon could be hollow. The experts ranged from scientists, sound/audio analysts experts, to most importantly the . . . ancient astronaut theorists! 
Question
My question is to know if this has already been proven to no way be true, or how easily this could be debunked (or proven) and optionally a brief theory of what this could mean scientifically either way to prove or disprove, etc. for what this actually is . . . . . a story or could it be true.  
The story seemed to also suggest Earth, the size of its moon, and the
   position of the moon to the Sun from Earth is extraordinary rare and
   some unknown technology could have done this so precisely.
