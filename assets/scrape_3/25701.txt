The CNO cycle in first generation of stars

I'm an undergrad interested in astophysics and this question struck my mind:
As the CNO cycle requires carbon to start, and carbon is produced by thermonuclear fusion in stars, is it fair to think that the hotter stars in the first generation didn't have a CNO cycle?
Or should I instead think that the first generation of stars had an initial metalicity and therefore the CNO cycle was possible?
