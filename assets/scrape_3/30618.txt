What is the distance from Venus to Jupiter in km?

I need to know this for a test. Please help. The question states "If a spacecraft was parked on Venus and needed to make a flight to Jupiter, how far would it need to travel? (Assume both planets are aligned with the sun and are on the same side of the sun.)"
