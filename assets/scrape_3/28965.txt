Is it possible for particles to be accelerated FTL inside BH travelling towards the singularity?

Maybe just maybe it is possible for a particle to travel FLT inside of black hole  because of the singularity gravitational force
This could be due to the fabric of space it self falling towards the singularity FTL beyond the event horizon. So technically 
A particle can go FTL moving with space itself not not moving through it, and this would break any laws of relativity
But if I'm wrong please tell me.
