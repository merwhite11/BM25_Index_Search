If the Higgs field only formed after the Big Bang, how was hydrogen formed?

These two statements seem to conflict, but since we're here they can't:

Electrically charged particles cannot be massless.
Hydrogen was created at the moment of the Big Bang.

However, the Higgs field theory states that the field was only created AFTER the Big Bang. This implies that all particles from which hydrogen could be formed were massless. Hydrogen consists of 2 charged particles.
If you could provide an answer without complex math I would really appreciate it.
