What is the light source in the black hole images?
I've searched the site before asking, as well as tried to google it. But perhaps the answer is buried due to the recent news.
My understanding, is that the ring in the images is an illuminated accretion disc.
What I could not find explained is the light source, and by extension, why is a bright accretion disc – which is round by definition – a proof for light bending? (I'm not disputing the fact.)
