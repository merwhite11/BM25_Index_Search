Will Triton have a thicker atmosphere as the Solar System ages?

With an average temperature of around 34 kelvin, Triton is extremely cold. Currently, it has a thin mostly nitrogen atmosphere with a pressure of around 1 Pa. However, its surface has large deposits of nitrogen ice. This leads me to a few related questions.

Do we know how much nitrogen ice is on Triton?
If all the nitrogen ice on Triton thawed, how thick would its atmosphere be?
Will Triton thaw naturally, and have a thicker atmosphere, in the future as the Sun's luminosity increases?
If so, would its atmosphere be stable over a long period of time?
In the far future, perhaps as the Sun turns into a red giant, would Triton be warm enough to have liquid water?
