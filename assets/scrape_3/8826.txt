Can an astronaut ever reach a Black Hole theoretically?

Ok, bear with me, while I try to explain the question I have.
I read that time slows as we approach a black hole.
So, suppose,theoretically, as astronaut is approaching a Black Hole. And he gets near enough now that time starts slowing down.
If you remember this equation: v=d/t  So, at the moment, t is going infinity, so it means 
V is going zero.
So the astronaut can never the reach the Black Hole because time is slowing down and its taking longer and longer for him to approach the Black Hole.
But then again, we know, a Black Hole sucks everything and that light cannot even escape it.
So, what's happening to the equation above then? [ this time it means v is going infinity and so, t is almost zero], so the astronaut will be sucked almost immediately.
Which one is the correct theoretical answer?
