Disc of the milky way

For those that haven't seen this link - please have a look as it's a an awe-inspiring 360 interactive panormic image of the milky way (may need a bit of time to load though!). I've found myself idly browsing it several times and as an astronomy layman I wondered if anyone could help me navigate what I'm looking at. 
While I can orientate myself and visualise where we are in the milky way, what is the distinctive black band? I'm assuming it is caused by the absence of stars in these areas. However, as I understood it, the disc (as well as the center) are the areas of highest concentration of stars. Are these 'gaps' caused by dark matter?
