Relationship between Color Index and Temperature

Is there an exact relationship between color indices and temperature? 
I have seen some numerical formulas relating B - V color index to temperature, of the form $B - V = a_1 + \frac{a_2}{T} $ . 
I am wondering is there any way to derive these formulas or are they completely empirical?
