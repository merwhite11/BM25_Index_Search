Will I be able to see the "Beads of Baily" at 99%+ totality?

Where I am (Vancouver, WA), the Sun will be 99%+ covered. Will I be able to see the "Beads of Baily" when the sun is 99%+ covered in my area ?
Downtown Portland, OR is expected to be 99.4% (according to local news). I expect Vancouver, WA, a suburb just north of downtown Portland, to be over 99% as well (99.3-99.2%??)
