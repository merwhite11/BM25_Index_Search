What determines if a comet's debris will produce periodic meteor showers?

Background
I was wondering if the debris from the comet NEOWISE that recently passed Earth would provide meteor showers in the future.
I looked up that the Perseid meteor showers happen when the Earth passes through the debris left behind by comet Swift-Tuttle which has a nucleus diameter of 26 km. In comparison, the comet NEOWISE has a nucleus diameter of 5 km. I am guessing this means it is too small to have a debris trail that produces periodic meteor showers? I was not able to find data about the length of these comets' tails.
The Question
What determines if the debris from a comet will produce periodic meteor showers in the sky?
After thinking about it a bit myself it seems like these variables should be important:

Diameter of the comet
Length of tail when comet reaches Earth's orbit (which probably depends on comet size and composition)
Orbit of comet and its relation to Earth's orbit
Orientation of comet / comet's tail in relation to Earth when it crosses the Earth's orbit
Whether or not tail extends to Earth as the comet moves farther away from Sun
Whether or not the debris persists after the comet has left

I was hoping someone could provide more insight into what determines if periodic showers will be produced by a comet. Specifically, what variables are involved (comet size, length of tail, comet's orbit in relation to Earth's orbit, etc.). I'm particularly interested in what determines the length of a comet's tail as well as whether a debris trail persists long after the comet has left.
