Could Mercury be the creator of Earth's Moon?

Earth's Moon is thought to have been created in a glancing collision with a Mars sized planet.
I've just seen an expose on Mercury which claimed Mercury: formed in the region between Earth and Jupiter, migrated to it's current orbit through an unknown interaction,  consist of 60% core material which was explained as the result of a glancing blow with a planet sized object.
Has anyone looked in to whether a Mercury/Earth collision could be the creator of our Moon?
