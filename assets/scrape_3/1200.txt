Timeline of falling into a blackhole

For some "average sized" black hole, how long would it take for a distant (spacesuit-wearing!) astronaut to:

be able to see the gravitational lensing with the naked eye 
clearly feel the gravity gradient
reach a lethal gravity gradient
cross the event horizon

Ultimately I'm interested in the subjective experience of a human falling into a black hole. Would it be drawn out and unpleasant? Or is it that by the time the gradient would be painful, there'd be barely any time at all before annihilation?
