How does the Large Binocular Telescope resolve so well in both orthogonal directions simultaneously?

The Forbes article Ask Ethan: How Does Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry Allow Us To Image A Black Hole? includes an example of optical interferometry from the Large Binocular Telescope, shown below.

The LBTO consists of only two telescopes 8.4 m (330 inch) wide mirrors, with centres 14.4 m apart, so I would expect to see higher resolution in one direction than the other.
However in this GIF the resolution seems to be the same in both directions. While I see high spatial frequency ringing in the horizontal direction, I don't see any difference in resolution. 
Since the event is so fast (probably minutes or seconds) there is no chance that the natural rotation of the baseline during the course of a night could have helped.
So I'd like to ask How does the Large Binocular Telescope resolve so well in both orthogonal directions simultaneously?
