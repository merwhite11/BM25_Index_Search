What explains the distribution of new impact craters on Mars?

24 minutes into this van Karman lecture by Dr. Tamppari, the slide below is shown with symbols for transient events on Mars. Red dots represent meteoroid impacts which have occurred while MRO has been in Mars' orbit.
New impacts are almost only found at lower latitudes. And longitudinally there are two equally sized gaps at the equator. Is this because of some observational bias or is there a natural explanation?
