When Betelgeuse goes supernova, will the explosion hit any neighboring stars?

There is evidence Betelgeuse might go supernova "soon". Are there any stars in the vicinity of Betelgeuse that are close enough that they will be hit by the explosion of this supernova? What would be the effect on stars near Betelgeuse?

A supernova "kicks" out the other star if it is in a binary pair, but Betelgeuse is not a binary, so this doesn't quite answer the question.
