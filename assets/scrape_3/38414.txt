What satellite is this?

While out viewing the Perseid shower last night (8/11/20), we saw an interesting object that I'm trying to identify. We're in the vicinity of Portland, Oregon. It appeared to be traveling west->east and would be almost invisible to the naked eye for 10 or so seconds, then flare up to be the brightest object in the sky for ~2 seconds. We saw two passes (or two separate objects) over the course of an hour, the first was a bit to the south (say 1 o'clock), the second was farther north (11 o'clock), it might have been the same object.
I was thinking it might be a Starlink satellite, but I would have expected to see more than just one. Also, I wouldn't think they would be that bright, being as small as they are.
I've not seen anything like that before, and it surely would have been noticeable in my past stargazing.
Anyone know what it might be?
