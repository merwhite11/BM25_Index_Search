Why isn't our local interstellar space colorised?

Looking at answers to this question, people seem pretty convinced that human naked eye should be able to see the colour of ionised gas/dust cloud when they are inside an emission nebula.
And we know Solar system is surrounded by Interplanetary dust cloud, and possibly inside an Interstellar cloud. Why don't we see a colorised space backdrop?
Does it have to do with density of gas cloud? or how ionised they are? Does camera with long exposure see some background colour our naked eye can't?
(Excuse me for any wrong terminology.)
