How far does the Earth travel around the Sun during each month of the year?

After reading about the Earth's orbit and how it moves faster in January than it does in July (based on its distance from the Sun), I started to wonder...
How far does the Earth travel around the Sun during each month of the year?
What is the math behind this calculation?
Note: I'm not asking about the average monthly distance, but the unique distance traveled for each month.
