Are we made of stars we're seeing?

a fresh astronomy enthusiast here.
Recently I've been reading upon how immensely far other stars are from our solar system and how is it possible that we may be seeing stars that are already dead. My question is - if there is a star that is a millions of light years away from us and we are seeing it shine tonight, but in reality that star died long long time ago (perhaps also millions of years ago), is it possible that matter from that star somehow travelled through space to our solar system and at some point in history it collided with the Earth and now we're "made" of this star (made as in that star stuff is present here on Earth)?
To me, I don't see reason why not, because even though matter cannot travel faster than light, my intuition tells me that the answer to my question is yes, it is possible that this could happen, (if only in theory) given enough distance. But maybe I'm not considering some important points which are obvious to more experienced folk.
