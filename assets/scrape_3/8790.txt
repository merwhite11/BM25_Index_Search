Why there are other planets in our solar system?

Earth receives sunlight from Sun; in a similar way, do we receive any kind of energy from other planets?
My question is: We are dependent on sunlight, which is energy from Sun; similarly, are we dependent on other planets as well? What would happen if they weren't there?
