Thinking of buying a new telescope. What aspects should be considered?

I'm new to astronomy and I have a Celestron 50Z but I'm thinking of buying a better telescope. 
I see that there are many options out there but I'm not really sure as to which aspects I should consider that make a good telescope.
Can anyone point me to the right direction? If you ask how much I'm willing to pay, I'd say up to US $300.
Any suggestions not just on telescopes but as I said, things I should be considering which make a good telescope worth buying.
