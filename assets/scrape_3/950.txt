Can I see comet ISON from Saudi Arabia?

I live in western Saudi Arabia, I am trying to see the comet ISON, reading here and there tells that I can see it by naked eye somewhere next to the constellation leo, I used an app to tells me where constellation leo is but I could not see the comet. 
Is it visible from Saudi Arabia? if so, in which direction (west, east, etc.) and what time is the best to see it?
