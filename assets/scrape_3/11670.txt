Is the Astronomy community still concerned about the lumpyness of matter distribution in the universe?

A decade or so ago, when I was still a science undergrad, one of the open questions in astrophysics was to explain the uneven distribution of galaxies in the observable universe.  That is, why did the universe look lumpy instead of evenly distributed.
Is this still an open question, and if so who is working on it?
