In space, can you tell that you're flying sideways?


Imagine a vehicle like the dragon capsule, but the chair is on the bottom and facing forward, and the thrusters are directly behind it as illustrated above. When flying in space towards some planet, can the astronauts tell they're facing down and flying not forward relative to the direction they're facing?
Edit
To add clarity, my question is not about the logistics of space travel, but the physics of the drawing. Assuming a craft like the one above, with thrusters on or off, the craft flying in the direction of the arrow, and the astronaut sitting as depicted... Would he/she be able to tell that they're flying "headfirst" as opposed to the traditional concept of "forward" like you would when flying an airplane?
