If the moon is losing energy dragging the oceans around, why is it moving away from earth instead of falling like any other satelite would?

If a satellite loses energy it starts to circle lower and finally hits the atmosphere. The moon is moving like an inch a year away from the earth even though it is losing energy pulling the oceans around.
