Surface conditions of lonely (rogue) planets

The question How are rogue planets discovered? describes the difficulties in finding planets (or planet-sized objects) that are floating through space without being under the influence of any star or Galaxy system.
What would the possible surface conditions of these planets be? Could chemotrophic life arise on such planets?
