Are there any to-scale diagrams of the TRAPPIST-1 system?

I was recently told that the planets in TRAPPIST-1 are close enough together that you can see them from each other, as visible, discernible planets "hanging in the sky". i.e. much like the moon.
This assertion is compatible with this question: How many things are wrong in this "artist view" of the TRAPPIST-1 system?

I'm trying to understand the implications of the claim, and started by trying to find a to-scale astronomic diagram of some, or all, of the TRAPPIST-1 system, showing the star, the planets, their sizes and orbits, to scale.
Obviously such a diagram of the (Sol-Terra) Solar System would be completely useless - a few pixels in the centre, surrounded by a 8 other single-pixel-dots around the diagram.
But if the claim is true for TRAPPIST-1, then I would expect such a diagram to be actually "usable".
But I couldn't find such a diagram. Does one exist?
