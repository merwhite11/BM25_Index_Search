Determining moonset time from Nautical Almanac

I have recently learnt to determine moonrise and moonset times using the Nautical Almanac, as part of my maritime navigation course. I have a query regarding the determination of moonset times. I will use an arbitrary date and an arbitrary latitude to illustrate my confusion. On 3rd February 2020, at the equator, the Nautical Almanac tells me that the moon will set at 0041 hrs. Does this mean that the moon that rises on 3rd February 2020 sets at 0041 hrs on 4th February 2020 or does this mean that the moon that rose on 2nd February sets at 0041 hrs on 3rd February 2020?
