Can Einstein-Rosen bridges - if they exist - link two points of which one lies outside of the observable universe of the other?

So there's stuff very far away that is, due to expansion, accelerating away faster than the speed of light, so fast that its light will never reach us even with infinite time - and we can't reach that point even if we travel at the speed of light for all eternity. The comoving distance of where the universe becomes fundamentally unexploreable is, afaik, some 46.5 billion light years or so.
Theoretical Einstein-Rosen bridges could connect any two points of space-time. What I wonder though is whether this could also apply to points that are farther than these 46.5 billion light years apart, or whether this is a theoretical maximum distance for wormholes as well?
Whether the answer is yes or no - an explanation would be great :)
Edit: maybe I'm mixing up observable universe and hubble volume here - I mean the one relevant to the question of course :)
