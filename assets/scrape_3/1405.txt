Are we made of the stuff of one star or more stars?


[T]his coincidence enabled stars in the late stages of their lives to turn helium into carbon, oxygen and most of the other atoms that you and I are made of. [...] [W]e're made of star stuff.

Max Tegmark, Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality, p. 64
Assuming that the Sun is not in the late stages of its life, I read that as that we are made mostly of star dust, but not Sun dust. Rather, we apparently are mostly made of atoms produced by earlier (now dead and buried) stars.
My question is whether it is likely that there was one immidiate (o.a. carbon-producing) predecessor star to the Solar System, or whether the Solar system likely has more than one (perhaps many) (o.a. carbon-producing) "parent stars"? (And, there seems to be also also a third "possibility": that the build-up of, say, carbon takes more than one generation of stars.) What's the (hi)story here?
