The equation for calculating how many times Earth (or our solar system) has revolved around the Milky Way

I have seen it said on Quora and Reddit that it's about every 220-250 million years to go around the Milky Way from Earth. Wondering what the rough equation is for calculating it. That is, I guess, the angular momentum and distance from the center, so I could visualize it on a sped up animation and otherwise derive something like those numbers 220 to 250.
