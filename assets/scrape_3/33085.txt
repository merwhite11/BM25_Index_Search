What is the meaning of ellipticity of a galaxy being more than 1?

I was recently doing a project on calculating ellipticities of galaxies using SDSS data. I downloaded the stokes parameter values (q and u) from data
$e  = 1 - \frac{b}{a} = 1 - \frac{1 - \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2}}{1 + \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2}} $
 and for few values of stokes parameters, the value of ellipticity goes above 1.

What could this possibly mean? Could this mean the data of random galaxies I've taken has irregular agalaxies in it and that's the reason for ellipticity being greater than 1? I would like to hear your opinions and answers.
