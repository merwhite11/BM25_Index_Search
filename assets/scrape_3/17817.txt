Which came first: Galaxies <=> Stars <=> Planets?

If a galaxy is defined as a collection of planetary systems (and all matter in between), and a planetary system is defined as a collection of planets circling a star (and all matter in between), and a planet (and other smaller bodies, like asteroids, moonlets, moons, etc) is basically just a very very, very large collection of minerals, stardust and gases (which make up the entire universe), which came first: The planets, planetary systems or galaxies? I've been given to understand the universe came first...but after that?
I thought I understood, at least the layman's basics, of the universe formation. However, today, Iâ€™m having trouble conceptualising the order in which they would have been formed, IF they are defined by the smaller unit.  
Is this just me getting the semantics of classification and the actual chronology of each feature forming, mixed up? 


VERY Basically,

The universe is made up of a complex mix of everything (matter, antimatter, darkmatter, to name just a few), and expanding 'space'.
A very, very, large area of 'space' is covered in very, very, tiny particles: made up of at first gases and later 'stardust'.
A galaxy is formed of gravity-attracted gases, and after the very first stars went supernova and exploded there was also 'stardust', which combines to create 'clumps' of interstellar clouds (cloud nebulae).
The cloud nebulae are the 'nursery' areas for star formation (both initial stars and later generation stars). 
The newly created star uses remnants of 'stardust' in the cloud nebulae to form planetary systems and then, a 'short' time later the orbiting planets (and other sized objects). 

So then the chronological order would be: 
Universe (Largest scale) => gases (very small scale) => galaxy => interstellar clouds => stars => planets (combined to form planetary systems). And the tiny particles of gases and 'stardust', are involved in nearly all scales.

Just writing out this question has helped! I hope you don't mind me posting it anyway, as it might help others and I still need confirmation that I have, hopefully, worked myself out of my conundrum (not deeper).
