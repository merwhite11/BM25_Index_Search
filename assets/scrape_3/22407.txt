calculate sunset in flight

I found an answer at 
https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/26795/how-to-calculate-the-amount-of-night-time-during-a-flight
but I was stuck at the part:
$\cosθ_1=\sinφ_1\sinφ+\cosφ_1\cosφ\cos(λ−λ_1)$
$\cosθ_2=\sinφ_2\sinφ+\cosφ_2\cosφ\cos(λ−λ_2)$
from which  $ (λ(t),φ(t))$
can be derived (after some tedious calculations).
