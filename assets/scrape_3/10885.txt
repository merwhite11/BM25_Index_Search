Why don't Australia/Russia have large optical telescopes?

Australia and Russia have large land areas. However, I am only aware of one 3.9m telescope in Australia. As far as I know, there are lots of mountains in Australia and Russia.
So why are there not many large optical telescopes?
The reasons for each country may differ because of their latitudes.
