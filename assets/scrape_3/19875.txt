Are these parallel lines I'm seeing in this image a real pattern on the Moon?

In this question I mention the GIF in EarthSky.org's Moon Phases update Lengths of lunar months in 2017. After watching it a while, I've noticed a pattern of parallel nearly vertical lines on the Moon image that's used to generate this simulation. I've shown it below. However, if I look at the moon image in Wikipedia, which is much larger, higher resolution, and has perhaps higher contrast, I don't see it.
It could be there, but less noticable due to the enhanced level of detail i the large image, but I am wondering - is it real, or not. If not, how did it get into this image?
