Kuiper belt planet formation

There are a lot of objects of different sizes in the Kuiper belt. Are objects in the Kuiper belt stable? Is there any chance in the future that one of the larger objects would accumulate enough critical mass to start the process of becoming a proper planet (i.e., clearing its neighboorhood)?
