Orion Skyquest xt8i Intelliscope Dobsonian Telescope Lens

I have the telescope in the title, which camps with 10mm and 25mm eyepieces. Both cannot really see anything in detail past the moon. All planets look like stars. What are good eyepieces for seeing all the other planets in detail, respectively?
