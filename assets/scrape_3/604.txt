Does the Moon's magnetic field affect Earth's magnetic field?

I wanted to ask a question; it's simple but I cannot find any possible and perfect solution.
Earth has poles, North and South. By which we can get directions using a compass or a needle compass, but that's not the concern.
My Question:
Would the Moon cause a change in the magnetic field of Earth when they are interpassing or colliding with each other, as the Moon does come between the magnetic path of the Earth. 
So would the Moon's magnetic field affect the Earth's magnetic field, just as its gravitational pull affects Earth's gravitational pull for oceans?
