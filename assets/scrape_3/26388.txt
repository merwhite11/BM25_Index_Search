Apart from Io, will any Galilean moons have oceans and land if their ice melts

When our sun expands earthlings, if still alive, will have to leave. The Galilean moons offer a lot of water but we would also need land.  As far as I can tell there will be no land for earthlings to live on when the oceans of these moons melt. Is anyone aware of land  masses on these moons and if so how large?
