Should I focus more on Aperture or Focal Length for a telescope?

Let's assume there are three types of telescopes with the following specifications:
    Telescope                  Aperture              Focal Length
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Example 1                     70 mm                    400 mm
    Example 2                     60 mm                    700 mm
    Example 3                     60 mm                    900 mm

As a beginner, should I look for a higher value in the aperture or the focal length?
