Is it possible to define a state of zero absolute angular momentum anywhere in the universe?

Conservation of angular momentum doesn't seem correct to me. I think this because radiation is present everywhere, no space is completely void, and no object perfect. Thus all objects will have uneven radiation pressure. My question is there anything in space that is not increasing or decreasing in rotation or is fixed in space? Is the rate in which an object spins is determined by surrounding celestial bodies? Or in other words any object in space depending on its position in the galaxy will slow or increase to an ideal rotation?
