Does red shift need to compensate for space expansion

Distant galaxies are moving as space expands, not moving through space.  So a photon coming to us from them has to come back through distorted space.  So is not spacetime distorted, so the photon has to go through an area where time slows down.  So would this cause red shift.  So maybe we have a simplistic view of red shift and maybe those galaxies are not going as fast as we think
