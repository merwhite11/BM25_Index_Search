Why is the main sequence often called 'zero age' main sequence?

The main sequence stage for a star begins after it stars burning hydrogen into helium. This is often referred to as the zero age main sequence.
This is confusing since stars have already lived several million years in their pre-main sequence stage.
Where does this come from? Is it a historical designation that just stuck?
