What record do we have of the length of supernovas?

recently I heard an astronomer on the radio claim that the supernova we have observed in our own galaxy lasted about 6 months, while in distant galaxies they last about 7-8 months, due to relativity and the expanding universe. He didn't give any references. Just to be clear, I don't mean to imply that he implied the actual duration was different, but that it only appeared different because of expansion. 
I've found records of supernova, but only 1 mentioned how long it lasted, the first recorded one was said to last 8 months according to wikipedia. 
Can someone point me to a list that contains both the location and duration of supernova's .
