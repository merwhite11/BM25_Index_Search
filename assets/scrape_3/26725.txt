Are magnetic field lines Spiral for Spiral Galaxies? If no, then how it look like topologically?

I am an undergraduate doing summer project at USO. I am working on Sun's Magnetic field model. I got spiral graph for that, which looks like any spiral Galaxy. Do you think that there is some correlation between them. Or let me put this way, is magnetic field of Galaxy spiral?
Thank You in advance.
