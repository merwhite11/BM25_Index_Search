Solving Friedmann equation for specific conditions

In Friedman equation:

the case k < 0, with a Universe containing only matter (pressure = 0)
  so that $\rho = \rho_0/ a^3$ . What is the solution a(t) in a
  situation where the final term of the Friedmann equation dominates
  over the density term? How does the density of matter vary with time?

The question from an introduction to modern cosmology from Andrew Liddle.
Friedmann Equation:
$$(\dot {a}/a)^2 = 8\pi G \rho / 3 - k/a^2$$ 
My problem is I don't even understand the question? what does the first question mean? the answer of the book is $a(t) \alpha t$. I am not even sure that it is the only answer. Can anyone say what the question wants and is the answer of the book, the only answer?
