Is there a term to describe all stars that are not neutron stars or white dwarfs?

I am looking for a official term that describes all stars that are not neutron stars or white dwarfs.  "Still burning stuff stars" or "ordinary stars" are all I have been able to come up with.  Is there an official term for stars that are still evolving and haven't "died" yet?
