What will the universe be like in a googolplex years time?

It will be cold and dark in 10^(10^100) years. 
What else can be said of the state of things in the far distant future? Will everything have fallen into supermassive black holes and then radiated back into space so there is no matter left?
Will the universe revert to an exotic state as it was in primordial times, or will it slow and stay unchanged indefinitely? What kind of structure will it have?
