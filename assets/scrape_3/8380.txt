Full Moon Position of Sun

I am trying to figure out the position of sun with respect to moon on a full moon day.
Here's an image from certain wiki which I do not find convincing.

If the sun rays point as shown in the image and the earth stands between the moon and sun on Full moon's day, I dont see any reason why the moon should be shining in its full glory.
Similarly when the moon is directly in between earth and sun, it should have maximum brightness but the image shows it as the new moon.
In fact, I cannot deduce how at all can moon receive light across the entire sphere at any given angle from the sun.
Putting it specifically, what would the position of sun w.r.t to earth and moon on a full moon day ?
