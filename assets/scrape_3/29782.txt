How do I calculate the sun's azimuth based on zenith, hour angle, declination, and latitude?

Wikipedia cites this formula for calculating solar azimuth:

Where:

$\phi_s$ is the solar azimuth angle
$\theta_s$ is the solar zenith angle
$h$ is the hour angle, in the local solar time
$\delta$ is the current sun declination
$\Phi$ is the local latitude

I'm implementing this equation in JavaScript, but it doesn't seem correct. Can someone here help me confirm whether or not this equation is correct?
Here's my JS implementation. The only strange thing is at the end: limiting the acos domain to [-1, 1] to prevent NaN values.
const getSolarAzimuth = function(
    zenithAngle, hourAngle, declination, latitude
) {
    const cos = Math.cos;
    const sin = Math.sin;

    const cos_phi = (
        sin(declination) * cos(latitude) - cos(hourAngle) * cos(declination) *
            sin(latitude)) /
          sin(zenithAngle);

    return Math.acos(Math.min(Math.max(cos_phi, -1), 1));
};
