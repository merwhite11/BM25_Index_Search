How did Eratosthenes know that the sun is far away?

The famous measurements and calculations done by Eratosthenes around 300 BC are very widely known. He concluded correctly that the circumference of the Earth is about $252\,000$ times the length of an athletic stadium.
But what Eratosthenes did would make no sense if the Sun were (for example) only $6000$ miles from the Earth. How did he know it was much farther away than that?
