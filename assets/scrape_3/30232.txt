Does the Sun's atmosphere have a scale height?

Much of the Earth's atmosphere has a scale height $h$ of roughly 7 to 8 kilometers such that the local density varies as $\exp(-(r-r_0)/h)$ where r is the radius vector and $r_0$ would be some reference radius above the surface of the Earth. 
This works approximately, at least up to 50 km (six or seven scale heights).
The derivation of this approximation is based on a simple gas at constant temperature, and those probably don't apply to the Sun's atmosphere very well.
Nonetheless, are there regions of the Sun's atmosphere where density varies approximately exponentially in such a way that a scale height characterization would work over the range of at least a few scale heights?
