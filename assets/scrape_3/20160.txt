Are the Trappist-1 planets in stable orbits?

The Trappist-1 planets all orbit very close to each other.  During NASA's press release, they mentioned that these planets are close enough to disturb each others orbits.  Is this system stable over a long time scale?  Or could we perhaps just have imaged this system before one or more planets is ejected or destroyed?
Later into the press conference, one of the scientists says "these planets should have formed further out and migrated inwards".  Could they possibly still be moving inwards, or are their orbits now stable?
