What is this rapidly twinkling red, blue, and white star I saw?

Last night, I was on my balcony at 1AM (PST) and I looked up and saw two stars near the horizon (I'd guess ~30 degrees above the horizon), and they were "twinkling" about twice as fast as other stars higher in the sky, and I could clearly see them changing from red to white to blue repeatedly. Other stars in the sky only appeared white to me, and didn't seem to "twinkle" as rapidly as these two stars did. The red and blue make me think of red-shift and blue-shift, but I don't know how I would see both from the same object.
What was I seeing?
I don't know if it helps, but I am in the Los Angeles area, and I was looking in a roughly north direction. almost exactly to the east, according to google maps.
Edit: I tried taking a picture, but light pollution from the nearby street lights wouldn't permit me taking a decent picture. However, I noticed a group of three stars close together in nearly a perfect almost vertical line, and managed to find that in Stellarium. I think I found the two stars I am seeing: Procyon and Sirius

Is there anything about either of these stars that would make them show as red/blue?
