applying nutation to ecliptical coordinates (apparent position of star)

I'm trying to calculate RA and DEC with nutation correction. The direct calculation in MEEUS Page 151 can't be used for stars close to celestial poles and I thought I'd turn RA/DEC into ecliptical longitude and latitude and then add delta psi to the longitude and transform back to RA/DEC. Unfortunately my calculations are wrong somewhere and I can't figure out where I made a mistake.
