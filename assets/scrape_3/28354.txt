What changes are being made to VIRGO and LIGO (if any)?

Gravitational wave detectors VIRGO and LIGO are currently down for some updates, slated to be completed sometime early next year (they hope). What exactly are they doing? I hadn't heard it was down again after the last set of updates awhile ago. What are they updating now-- is that knowledge public domain?
