My supernovae question

I understand the collapse of a star during a supernova, as the outward pressure cannot compete with the gravitational field.
Is it conceivable, that a relaxation of the space-time curvature is what expands the space and looks like an explosion?
I have often wondered, to extrapolate, if a "release" of the curvature of space itself, or in an extreme example a massive black hole releasing all of its potential energy in an instant (In a way not yet understood) could be in fact the (or a) big bang.
