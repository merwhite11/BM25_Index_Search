Classification of Planets?

The data from Kepler has taught us that there is a much larger number of "Neptune-class" planets out there than we previously thought. I wonder, however, if this "dominance" of Neptunes is because of the wide range of radii we use to define this class. If I'm not mistaken, we classify a planet as "Earth-like" when it is in the range 0.75 to 1.25 R(Earth), "Super-earth" from about 1.25 to 2.0 R(Earth) and "Neptune class" from 2.0 to 6.0 R(Earth) (a much larger range which would stand out even more if we knew masses). Are we maintaining the nomenclature to classify planets of different characteristics or are we just "solar system biased"?
