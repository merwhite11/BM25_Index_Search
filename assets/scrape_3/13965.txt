Eclipse Cycle Calculations Needed

I am writing a work of fiction about a world where:
The length of a year is 335 days.
The world has two Moons.
Moon A is Larger and further away with a 78 day lunar orbit.
Moon B is smaller and closer with a 31 day orbit.

How often would both moons be full at the same time, overlapping each other like a bullseye?
How often would lunar eclipses occur for Moon A?
How often would lunar eclipses occur for Moon b?
How often would both eclipse at the same time?

This is a work of fiction, so liberties can be taken.  I just want it to be close.
