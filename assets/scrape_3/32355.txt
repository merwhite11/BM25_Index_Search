Is the longitude assigned to sunspots spherical or projected?

Sunspot maps are created from a projection of the sun, so the coordinates of sunspots (or active regions in general) are assigned according to it. 
Do these coordinates correspond to actual spherical positions, or are they altered as a result of the projection? 
Edit: After seeing the answer, I realized that a part of what I am asking about was not clear in the initial question. So here it is: Are the values of the sunspot coordinates as provided officially in spherical positions or in projection? 
A commonly used instance of "official" records is X-ray measurements from the NOAA GOES. The text files are found here. 
For example, see file for 2000. The output is documented here, under "Output File Specification".
