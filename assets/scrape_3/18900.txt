Which observatories help NASA find 5 new asteroids per day?

I just read the following in the NPR website news article NASA's New 'Intruder Alert' System Spots An Incoming Asteroid.

NASA pays for several telescopes around the planet to scan the skies on a nightly basis, looking for these objects. "The NASA surveys are finding something like at least five asteroids every night," says astronomer Paul Chodas of JPL.

Which telescopes are the "several telescopes around the planet to scan the skies on a nightly basis" that NASA pays? 
Also, is it really roughly five new actual asteroids identified per day (almost 2,000 per year), or is that 5 objects detected, and only some small fraction turn out to actually be unique, new objects?
5 per day sounds like a lot.
