Why is gravity only an attractive force?

As per the universal law of attraction, any two bodies (having some mass) experience a force of 'attraction' which is proportionate to ...and ...inverse proportionate ....
Then comes my question: Why it should be force should be of type 'attraction' only ?  Why it should not be repulsion / any other kind of force ?
