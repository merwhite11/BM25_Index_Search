When will all eight planets in our solar system align?

Ignoring expansion of the universe, entropy, decaying orbits, and interference from any bodies colliding with or otherwise interfering with their orbits, will the eight planets known planets in our solar system ever align?
What is the "period" of the planets; how often would they align perfectly? And based on their current positions, how far off into the future is their next theoretical alignment?
