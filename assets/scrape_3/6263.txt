During what time of the year can Centaurus be seen from Tokyo?

During exactly what dates of the year can the Centaurus constellation be seen from Tokyo, Japan? And what is the ideal date for viewing it from Tokyo?  I found on a website that it can been seen May-June in New Zealand, best visible at 21:00 (9pm) during May and that the midline is May 20th.
(According to the Japanese Wikipedia page for Centaurus, only from Okinawa can the entire constellation be seen; in Tokyo, apparently only part of it can be seen.)
