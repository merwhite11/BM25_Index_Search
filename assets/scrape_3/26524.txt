Is thermal disintegration of meteorites variable with lattitude?

If meteorites and bolides are aligned to the solar system,  then do they have twice as much atmosphere to go through at high latitudes? 
Wouldn't we expect a higher percentage of metal meteorites further from the equator,  because they disintegrate slower in prolonged atmospheric traversal?
