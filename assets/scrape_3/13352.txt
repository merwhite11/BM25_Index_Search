Could the KIC 8462852 (Alien megastructure star) be explained by orbiting gas clouds?

I was wondering about the light dimming of the 'alien megastructure' star.
From what I understand, for it to be a planetary body, it would have to be some 20 times the size of Jupiter.
Is it possible that it could be caused by some huge, dense gas cloud, orbiting around the star?
