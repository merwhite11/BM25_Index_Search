Finding a location using the direction of shadow, UT and date approximately

Does anyone know how to find a location by using :

the direction of shadow relative to the normal (for example azimuth
angle) 
the Universal time (UT) and date

I have a satellite image and I know north, time and date. One of the cues that I can use is, for example, in the northern hemisphere the direction of shadow is north.
Would anyone know if it were possible, and how, to calculate the location based on these parameters?
