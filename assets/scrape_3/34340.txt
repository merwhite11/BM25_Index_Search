Are the stars distributed in uniform distribution, on the celestial dome, with respect to brightness?

Has there ever been a statistical analysis of the distribution of stars in the sky (on the surface of the celestial dome), by brightness? I want to know if they are uniformly distributed.
For example, all stars with Apparent Magnitude from 1.0 to 2.0. Are these uniformly distributed? Then all stars from 2.0 to 3.0, etc.
EDIT: To avoid bias for the Milky Way, there should be some cutoff magnitude. I don't know exactly what's the best cutoff, but I would guess somewhere around 4.0 to 5.0 apparent magnitude. If the cutoff is 4.0, then that gives us 3 tiers to look at (1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4). Are each of those tiers uniformly distributed?
Btw, the "obvious" distribution of theta from 0 to 2pi and phi from 0 to pi will NOT produce a uniform distribution. That will produce clustering near the poles. Wolfram Alpha explains it.)
I did google around for this. The results are all about star clusters or binaries, not the actual starfield of the night sky, or sometimes about how to program a random set of stars on the sphere.
That's not what I want. I'm looking for a statistical analysis on our own starfield. Has it ever been done before? What were the results?
