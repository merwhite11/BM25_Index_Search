Telescope and its construction

I want to build a reflecting telescope in my home. I've attached a drawing of my plan that contains some explanations of what I understand so far, and highlights the parts of the design for which I have questions.
What type of mirror should i use, parabolic or spherical, and what are the factors considered when making that decision? 
Does the glass used to make the mirror affect the incoming light rays? What about the secondary mirror in the middle of the tube?
Are there other things to consider that would help for higher magnification? 
Some telescopes have a glass window at the front where light enters the tube, why is that? Would I need to add it here?
