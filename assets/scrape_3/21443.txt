What is this bright "glow" in the center of galaxies?

It was always my belief that at the center of many galaxies, there are supermassive black holes. If this is the case, then we should not see a "light" coming out from the center since light get's sucked in black holes. Doing a quick search of galaxies on google image, I came across this:



These are famous galaxies, and real, and so I was wondering what this very white-yellow glow is in the center. If it is a collection of stars, then why are there so many stars in the center of a galaxy? If there is a black hole there, then why is there light?
