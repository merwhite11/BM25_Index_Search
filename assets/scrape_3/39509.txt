Gift for 16 year old Aspiring astrophysicist,,,,

I'm an outsider here, so please bear with me.
I have a 16-year-old nephew interested in the field of astrophysics and am looking for a birthday gift.  I had thought about a book on astronomy, but don't see that field listed as a core pre-requisite for that career.  Is knowledge of astronomy a core pre-requisite/useful for this profession?
Thank you
