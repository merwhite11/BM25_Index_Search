How does the amount of dark matter in measured galaxies vary?

I have recently viewed two news articles announcing a galaxy composed almost entirely of dark matter and one with hardly any. This made me wonder if there is a "continuum" of percentages of dark matter in galaxies, where it has been measured, or if there is a "preferred" range.
