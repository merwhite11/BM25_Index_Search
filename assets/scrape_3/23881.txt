Is this a real photo or an art work?

I've never seen this Hubble picture, is it an artist impression? It's fascinating because there are voids apparently cause by supernovae. 

From the video 1 Hour of Epic Space Music: COSMOS - Volume 1
The deviant art mentioned in the information below the video is by Natasha Sharma, she has a different style than that. There are also real photos from hubble in the video, I can't tell if it is a genius space artist or a real photo.
