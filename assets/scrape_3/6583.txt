Is it possible to see a moonrise or moonset twice in a day?

I've been wondering this for quite some time.  Due to the variations in tilt from the earth we know that moonrise/moonset times vary.  Is it possible that in any location on the earth one might see more than one moonrise or moonset in a given 24 hour period?
