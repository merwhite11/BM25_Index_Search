What are the steps I have to follow to join a SETI programme from my location (India)?

I just want to know if I can be part of a SETI project. I have gone through the SETI website, but I still didn't get enough guidance. Apart from installing the BOINC software for letting my machine be used as part of SETI, is there another way round through which I can explore something about extraterrestrial life whether through institutions or as part of any community?
I simply do not want to be part of community which believe green men are visiting earth, but I want to be part of a genuine one. I can give inputs in computing, programming, and communications as an engineer.
