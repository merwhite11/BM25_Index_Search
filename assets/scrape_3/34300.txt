Difference in gravity on both sides of the moon

How much (if any) difference in gravity would you feel if you are on the surface of the moon and:

standing right 'under' earth (exaclty between the moon and the earth) and
on the opposite side of the moon (So both, the moon and earth are exactly under you)
