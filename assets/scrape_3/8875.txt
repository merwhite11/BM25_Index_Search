Difficulties in finding Jupiter

I am new to astronomy. Jupiter is now visible to the naked eye but I have difficulties in locating it with my (new Newtonian reflector) telescope. The lowest magnification I have is 36X, which I guess is part of the problem(?). Any tips for the beginner..? I feel that if I knew any star constellations, it would help in locating objects.
