Do we know how old the matter that makes us is?

Last weekend, I had the pleasure of visiting an observatory where there was a series of lectures to cover up the fact that there was too much cloud cover to actually observe much at all.
One of these lectures involved the life-cycles of stars, which mainly involves Hydrogen and Helium.
Out of curiosity, I raised the question

How old is the matter that make us and where does it come from?

The "where" is covered by Nucleosynthesis, but the "how old" was shrugged away with "maybe 2-3 sun lifetimes".
Is it possible to more accurately estimate the age of the matter that made up our solar system's accretion disk?  Or is the likely source of the supernova/collisions involved unlikely to be known?
