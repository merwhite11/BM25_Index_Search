Are we moving faster than the Cosmic microwave background radiation?

if the Cosmic microwave background radiation is coming towards us in the speed of light and all matter and energy was singular at the big bang, doesn't that mean we somehow moved faster than the speed of light (otherwise the CMBR would have already passed us not be coming toward us?)
