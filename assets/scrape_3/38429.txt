how to find the approximate [stellar radius]? (distance from center to most distant star) of a circular flat disk galaxy based on its stellar mass?

I'm doing a high school programming project on drake's equation (simple galactic model) and wondered if there was a (simplified) way to find the radius (measured by the distance between the center and furthest star) of a galaxy based on its stellar mass. I found a few websites but I don't understand many of the terms and symbols in the equations shown. would love a simplified equation if possible.
In the project, I am modeling a 2d circular disk galaxy with no rotation.
I have a Y10 level understanding of maths.
