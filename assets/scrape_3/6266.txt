Why is sodium such a common ion for in ion tails?

I was doing research about ion tails of planetary bodies and noticed that ion tails composed of sodium were common. For example, Mercury and the Moon both have ion tails made of sodium. Why is sodium, as opposed to other ions, commonly seen in ion tails?
