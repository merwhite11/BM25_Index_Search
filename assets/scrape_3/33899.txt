Does the sun cross other spiral arms in its movement around the galaxy's center?

Today, Ansa.it released an article that states:

[...]. In questo suo peregrinare galattico, il Sole ha attraversato anche
  i due bracci della Via Lattea Perseo e Centauro. "Sono zone di alta
  densit√† stellare, in corrispondenza delle quali il Sole e le stelle
  intorno rallentano e possono anche fermarsi, [...]

(my) translation to English:

In this galactic wandering, the sun traversed the two spiral arms of the Milky Way, Perseus and Centaurus.
  These are regions of high density of stars, in correspondence of which
  the Sun and other surrounding stars slow down and can even stop, [...]

The article is complemented with a suggestive video-clip that depicts the Sun orbiting around the galaxy's center and crossing various spiral arms.

Given my lack of an education on the topic, I cannot reconcile the existence of an entity called "spiral arm" with the notion that a star can freely cross several "spiral arms" in its movement around the galaxy's center.
My intuition is that if every star within the Milky Way could freely cross the "spiral arms" several times during their life-span, then there would be no such thing as a "spiral arm" at all (because this is supposed to be a mass grouping wherein all matter moves --please forgive me the abuse of the word-- "together").

Where am I wrong?
Is the above description of the movement of the Sun accurate?
In case of an affirmative answer, is it a very special case or is it a defining characteristic of the entire Orion's arm?
In the latter case, can other spiral arms cross each other?
