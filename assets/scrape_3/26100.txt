Fate of Jupiter when our sun dies


Five billion years from now, the sun will have grown into a red giant star, more than a hundred times larger than its current size.
  While this metamorphosis into the giant star will change the solar system, scientists are unsure what will happen to the third rock from the sun.We already know that our sun will be bigger and brighter, so that it will probably destroy any form of life on our planet. 
  But whether the Earth's rocky core will survive is uncertain.
  At the end of its evolution, seven billion years from now, the sun will become a tiny white dwarf star.

When our sun runs through its last phase of its life it will expand and tremendous solar flares will flow out of it. Earth will end up getting baked and will lose its atmosphere.
Jupiter is a gas giant planet, a GAS GIANT. So,
What will happen in Jupiter? Will it evolve into a star since it contains hydrogen and helium? How will the atmosphere deal with the extreme heat?
