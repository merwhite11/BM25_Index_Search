Do comets contain any significant amounts of iridium?

I have Googled "iridium content of comets" and can't find anything that suggests comets contain iridium in any detectable quantities. Yet, whenever I read an article about the Chicxulub impactor, the article invariably says something to the effect that it may have been created by an asteroid or a comet. But Alvarez and company first offered the impact hypothesis for the K-T extinction by observing an iridium layer in global sedimentary deposits, which could only have come from an asteroid impact, since iridium is extremely rare in the Earth's crust. Later the Chicxulub structure was identified as the probable site of the asteroid impact. While a comet could have caused the Chicxulub crater, it could not have been responsible for the global iridium layer. So why do science writers offer the comet alternative? If Chicxulub was created by a comet, then another site must have been the source of the iridium layer.
