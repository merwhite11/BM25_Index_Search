Please Guide me to buy my first Telescope

I am a beginner and I've planned to buy a telescope(Newtonian reflector)for viewing planets and deep sky objects. As far as I know the most important factor to get a brighter view is that the telescope need to have a good aperture. I need a telescope that would be good both for viewing planets and deep sky objects.So my question is here as a beginner how much aperture is necessary to get amazed with the space. And I don't know much regarding telescope so please let me know the other factors for getting good view of celestial objects.
