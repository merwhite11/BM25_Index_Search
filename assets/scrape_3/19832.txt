Can cosmic rays alone produce noticeable aurorae in bodies far away from the Sun?

Aurorae are caused by energetic particles interacting with planetary atmospheres. Part of this flux comes from the Sun (solar wind) while the rest is cosmic radiation. My main question is: could a planetary body located far away from the Sun (or any other star), with a suitable atmosphere and magnetosphere, have noticeable* aurorae, just from being exposed to cosmic rays? A related question would be: do we know how much of the aurora is caused by the solar wind, and how much by cosmic rays? And thirdly: is there any other way that a planetary body could produce aurorae, such as its own electromagnetic emissions?
*I know "noticeable" doesn't really work as a limit, but for the time being, I'm talking of electromagnetic radiation that can be distinguished clearly from the background of a planet's disc using instruments not more advanced than our current telescopes at interplanetary distances.
