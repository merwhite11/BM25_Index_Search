How do I see the milky way?

I've travelled to farms at night, and away from civilation. I don't really know alot about astronomy, but my goal is to see something like this:

Stars, lots of them, but that "thick purple cluster of gas right in the center". I want to see that.

I want to see this "thick cloud cluster, which I assume is the milky way". How do I see this? How on some days do I only see just stars and stars, when I really want to see this main beauty?
