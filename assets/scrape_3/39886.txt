What's the difference between a crater and a basin?

When I was searching the name of the Moon's largest crater, many websites said that it was the South Pole-Aitken Basin. But in some definitions I've found, the word "crater" is used to describe smaller impacts on the Moon surface, and since the South Pole-Aitken Basin has a diameter of almost 2500 km, I'm not sure if you could say that the South Pole-Aitken Basin is the Moon's largest crater.
