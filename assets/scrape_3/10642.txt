Is there a way to tell what the surface of a planet is like?

Kepler-442b
I'm doing a project in which I need to find a planet within our galaxy that might be habitable. I found this planet that is within its stellar system's habitable zone, and due to research I have found that this planet is one of the closest in similarity to Earth, in terms of size, and temperature. But I don't really know anything about the surface or physical features.
I think there is an equation to find if there is life on another planet, but I cant find anything about water... 
If you can help me, thank you so much.
I need to know the physical and chemical features on a planet's surface. I know the planet is within the habitable zone and is thought to contain water, but I need more detail, if there is any way to get the specific or at least highly probable features of the surface. Sorry I didn't make this clear enough.
