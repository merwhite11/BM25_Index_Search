How do we measure the mass of a star?

I recently came across the book intro to cosmology by j.v. Narlikar, where it mentions about quarks and other star and inadvertently uses mass of sun as reference. I want to know how me measure mass of a star?
I guess from the parallax method we could calculate distance?
