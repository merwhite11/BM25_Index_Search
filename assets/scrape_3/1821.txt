What happens to the shrinking universe in the presence of the pressure of Hawking radiation?

Black holes release Hawking radiation. Now assume that the universe after all collapses back again, bringing all matter to a single black hole. I assume that this would bend the whole space-time of the universe as well, wrapping it around the black hole.
Now what happens to the shrinking universe in the presence of the pressure of Hawking radiation?
Could there be a stable point where pressure and gravity are balanced?
