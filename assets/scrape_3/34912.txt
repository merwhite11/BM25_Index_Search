What does Sa and Sab mean for spiral galaxies?

I have learned that the notation to classify spiral galaxies in the De Vaucouleurs system goes like "SA for spirals without bar, SB for spirals with bar and SAB for intermediate spirals". But in some places I've seen galaxies classified as Sa or Sab for example. What it means and what is the difference between a Sa and a Sab spiral?
