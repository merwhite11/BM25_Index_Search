How would the pocket cellular clock work?

In a museum in Lviv, I saw a pocket cellular clock. I don't have a photo, but it was a small disc that had 2 or 3 filaments in it which were pointed at the stars (one of them was Andromeda, I think). Through analyzing the position of the stars it was possible to determine the time of the night. I'm not sure if knowing the day of the year was promised.
I couldn't find the information about the way the clock was used. Does anyone know how such device was used?
