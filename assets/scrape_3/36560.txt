Types of Multiverses

Can anyone recommend me books or other online resources on the concept of the Multiverse, it types, and about higher mathematical dimensions of space-time. I have been interested in such topics for a while but have not found any accessible book that could explain them in a way that's comprehensible to me. (I'm new to the subject of astrophysics, just getting started).
