How do GHA of vernal equinox, GHA of astronomical object and RA relate?

I have zero clue in astronomy and I need astronomical data to write a program. What I learned so far:

celestial coordinates are usually measured relatively to vernal equinox aka meridian of First point of Aries (which is not located in Aries anymore)
the GHA of first point of Aries changes constantly

I was searching for vernal equinox GHA data and it seems to me that this personal, generated Almanac version lists it as "Aries" (it was misleading me).
I expected that
( GHA(object) - GHA(v. equinox) ) mod 24h = RA (object)
as per this article. However I have found a program which calculates declination and right ascension and I have found out that the relation is sort of inverse. For example:

And the program output:  

               The Moon

So:
110 deg 56,9 sec - 100 deg 7,1 sec = 10 deg 49,8 sec
which is inverse of R.A. which program lists.
Do I have a misconception?
