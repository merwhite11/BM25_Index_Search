Need Simple equation for Rise, Transit, and Set time

I've been looking, unsuccessfully, for hours for a simple set of equations:
Input: 
RA and Dec of an object
Observers Lat and Lng
Current Time
Output: 
Rise Time 
Transit Time
Set Time
(and, hopefully) max elevation at transit 
(and, hopefully) current alt and az of object
It seems like this should be a simple relationship, but I haven't been able to find it.
If an equation simply gives the current alt/az for an object, I guess I could solve for az and then find the maximum for a given time range. 
Questions: 
1. Anybody know of such equations? Or, even better, some sample code. 
2. If not, can anybody point me in the right direction?
Thanks
