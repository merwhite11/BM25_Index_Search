Direction of Earth’s poles relative to the Sun’s movement around the Galaxy

The plane of the solar system is at 63 degrees to the plane of the galaxy, then either the North or South Pole of Earth would be on the ‘leading edge,’ i.e. pointing roughly in the direction of movement around the galaxy (+/-23.5 degrees depending on the direction of the tilt of the earth at the time). Would there be any effect on the atmosphere at the front of this direction of travel caused by additional collision / friction with space dust or solar wind? For example, if the South Pole was on the leading edge, could something like the ozone hole be exacerbated by interstellar particles, or could the auroras be more spectacular at the pole that points forwards? If so, is there evidence of seasonal variation in these effects as the tilt of the earth increases or decreases that pole’s angle towards the direction of the sun’s movement along the galactic plane?  
Also, would the plane of the planets be shifted slightly to the rear of the midline of the sun because the sun is, in effect, dragging them behind it?
Finally, is there any evidence of increase or decrease in the above postulated effect depending on whether the solar system is above or below the galactic plane during its 30 million year oscillation? E.g. if there were more interstellar dust while passing through the mid-plane, would that leave a 30 million year signature in polar ice-core samples?
