How do I download PSRCHIVE and Tempo2 for pulsar timing on Mac Mojave?

I am fairly new to pulsar astronomy, and I need to download PSRCHIVE and then Tempo2. I have followed the instructions online here: 
PulsarAstronomy.net
I'm also pretty new to linux commands/Mac terminal in general, so I think I might be missing something obvious. 
So far I have untarred the tar file, which gave me a directory 'psrsoft' in Downloads. 
I also attempted to open a psrsoft bash profile, but I don't think it worked because none of the psrsoft commands worked. 
The instructions mention '$PSRSOFT_DIR' a lot, and I am not sure where that is supposed to be or what it represents.
Right now, my goal is to get the package installation options listed and then from there install Tempo2. 
This is what psrsoft contains:
Downloads/psrsoft>bin: pkg_files, psrsoft, psrsoft-selfupdate, psrsoft-shell, psrsoft-update-index, psrsoft.py, shell_files, usr
Downloads/psrsoft>config: profile.example
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
