Does the relative motion between planets other than Venus and Earth form shapes such as the Flower of Venus?

I was reading about the Pentagram/Flower of Venus, and how it is caused by a 13:8 ratio between their orbits. I found this GIF particularly fascinating. 
My question is, if the ratio changed, would they form other kind of "fractal" shapes? Does this happen between other planets? What would be the condition for the ratio so that the relative motion forms a symmetrical shape like the Cardioid in the case of Venus and Earth?
