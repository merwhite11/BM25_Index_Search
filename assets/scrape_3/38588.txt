If the sun is a second or third generation star, where is the neutron star?

It is widely believed that before the Sun was another star, more pristine in its composition (mostly Hydrogen and perhaps some Helium). And maybe before it was yet another. This blog explains this via the distribution of materials. Now, these previous stars that pre-date the Sun, must have been massive, right? If so, shouldn't they have formed a neutron star or black hole once their lives ended? But there isn't one of those at the center of our solar system. What other stellar evolution paradigm would explain this?
