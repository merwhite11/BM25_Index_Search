What would a black hole merger look like?

Ship 1 is out side the black hole. Ship 2 is nearing a black hole. To ship 1 it would appear that ship 2 would be moving slower to the point it would seem like ship 2 stopped moving the closer to the black hole ship 2 gets.
I imagine that 2 naked black hole(an infinity dense point with out a surrounding black hole) merging would look like a blur from the speed of them, but and because of the time dilatation is this gif picture below a good rendering of how the merger would appear to ship 1? Then how fast does a black hole move when merging??
