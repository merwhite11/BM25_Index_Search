How does the Event Horizon Telescope implement the interferometry?

The BBC article Event Horizon Telescope ready to image black hole describes the Event Horizon Telescope, a coordinated observing technique with several radio telescope arrays across the globe forming a synthetic aperture with an Earth-sized baseline.
$$\frac{\lambda}{r_{Earth}} \sim \frac{r_{Sag A*}}{D_{Sag A*}} \sim  10^{-11}$$
...when plugging in 1 millimeter for $\lambda$, and with $r_{Sag A*}$ and $D_{Sag A*}$ the radius of, and distance from Earth to Sagittarius A*, the black hole in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy of 20 million km and 26,000 light years, respectively. (values taken from the article).
The equation I've written shows that millimeter wavelength interferometry with an Earth-sized baseline has the possibility to resolve the existence of some structure with scale of the black hole's event horizon.
My question is How does the Event Horizon Telescope implement the interferometry? It would certainly be impossible to bring all signals together to a central site and perform the interference there in real time as down-converted analog signals, and quite difficult/expensive to do it with dedicated, synchronized digital optical fiber lines. Is the massive amounts of data sent as IP packets over the internet to a central correlator (numerical interferometer)?
The article mentions atomic clocks and lots of hard drives, and I have a hunch these have something to do with it.
