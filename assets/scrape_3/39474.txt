Strange Sighting, Help Needed!

I live in Hyderabad. Around a week ago, I, with my mother went to observe the planets from my roof I had observed Jupiter and Saturn till they went down below the horizon and then I was ready to move my telescope on Mars which was about just above my head. When I looked at it I saw a really strange 5 dotted flying thing fly a little towards the left of Mars. I asked my mother, and as she had sight and was not wearing spectacles, She didn't see it as 5 dots, but a thin straight line.
I know that it cannot be a rocket or jet plane as it left no trail, and it can't be  a plane or helicopter as it made no sound. I read a similar post about 2-3 weeks ago about a U.F.O collecting stars, but this was not at all like it. Could anyone tell me if it was anything known or if that is really an Undefined Flying Object?
