Identify this 2 axis motorized tripod

I am NOT an astronomy person, so this may be a dumb question, however I have recently found a tripod that appears to be for star tracking as far as I can guess. I would like to know the type of tripod and if possible the brand as it is not labeled and I do not know how to operate it.
