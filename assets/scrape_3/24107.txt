Is there a physical limit to how far we can go?

Is there a physical limit to how far we can go?  I am thinking there could be based on the following:
1: There are parts of the universe expanding faster than the speed of light that we will never be able to get to (without faster than light travel)
2: There are a finite number of galaxies between here and the distance where 1 takes place.
3: If we travel even at the speed of light, it seems we would at some point pass that finite number of galaxies, and would not be able to reach the next one!
Does this mean there is a limit to how far we can go, and furthermore, we will experience the “big rip”?
