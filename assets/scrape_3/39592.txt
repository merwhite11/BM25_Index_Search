Gamow Energy, Peak, Width and Window?

I am trying to wrap my head around Gamow energy and itâ€™s various terms.
To put it simply I understand higher Gamow energy reduces the chance of penetration relating to the Coulomb barrier.
For the width/window would it be fair to say that a higher value indicates a bigger window so therefore more chance of fusion occurring?
To be clear i am not asking for equations or help with any specific problem sets in nuclear fusion but I hoped some more knowledgeable people than myself could guide me on some simple understanding of the process.
I hope that makes sense?
Thank you in advance.
