How would the barycenter of a double-planet system affect the two planets' surface gravity?

Assuming two similarly sized, tidally locked planets orbit a common barycenter, how would the gravity of the barycenter affect the surface gravity? For example, on the inner sides of the planets, what would be the effect of the multiple gravity centers (the planets' and the barycenter), especially to a being on the surface?
