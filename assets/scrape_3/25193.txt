Home telescope for viewing 2017 VR12

News has come up lately about the impending approach of asteroid 2017 VR12 and how it might be visible to some backyard telescopes. However I've read conflicting or vague reports on what kinds of telescopes will be powerful enough to spot it.
I've got a modest but still decent little Celestron NexStar 4 SE, which is a 4" Schmidt-Cassegrain. Can anyone say for sure whether that has the power to see the asteroid? Currently I just have the stock eyepiece. Would I need to get a better one to help out?
