What is the naming convention for temporary moons?

Is there a naming convention for temporary moons? Or do they follow the naming conventions of other small bodies?
In the case of 2006 RH$_{120}$, 2015 HP$_{116}$, 2020 CD$_3$ and 2020 SO, the first number is the year. I assume the following letter+number combination somehow indicates the time of year of discovery and/or the number of similar bodies discovered prior?
How were YX205B9, WT1190F, S509356 and XC83E0D named?
