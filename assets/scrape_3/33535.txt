How would a small nearby black hole be detected and confirmed as such?

This article suggests that there might be a tennis ball-sized black hole orbiting the Sun somewhere beyond the orbit of Neptune. According to the article, observational anomalies of trans-Neptunian objects suggest that there is an object out there about 10 times the size of Earth (I assume it to mean about 10 Earth mass). Since searches have failed to find such an object, an alternative hypothesis claims that there may be a primordial miniature black hole out there. The article goes on to state that a black hole has not be found there because searches have been for planets and the methods used to find planets are different than those used to find black holes.
My question is: how would such an object (mini black hole) be detected, to either confirm or rule out its existence?
