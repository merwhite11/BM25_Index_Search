What is the orientation of the M87 black hole image relative to the jet?

On the image of the M87 black hole released today by the Event Horizon Telescope team, which direction points towards the jet? Is it on the brighter side of the ring?
To resolve ambiguity, I'm talking about the main observed jet, not the fainter counterjet.
