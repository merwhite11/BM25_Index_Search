From whence is the Event Horizon Telescope black hole data available for amateur reconstruction?

Ralf Vandebergh's tweet shows his own reconstruction of an image of the accretion disk around a black hole, generated presumably from Event Horizon Telescope data.
I'm assuming that the data came from a publicly available source, but I don't know for sure. That would make sense, they used two completely independent groups to reconstruct the images to cross-check each other before they were published, because with so few of the telescopes in the array recording data at any one time, the reconstruction took a bit of artistic license or "filling in". 
Since the raw data is huge, boxes and boxes of hard drives with high speed digital recording of GHz rate ADC conversions, I don't think there's an ftp site for the actual raw data. And since calibrations and baselining is pretty complicated, it would be hard to reconstruct.
So I'm wondering what kind of data is available that would allow someone to reconstruct their own EHT image?
FYI Ralf Vandebergh's astrophotography can be found in links within Why exactly do “CMOS astrophotographers” prefer CMOS sensors?
