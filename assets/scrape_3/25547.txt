Estimates VOLUME of the ur-Supermassive Black Hole of this universe

Assuming  Prof. Poplawski's "universe in a black hole" ( and at Arxiv here ) concept is true--that our universe is the result of a nonsingular Big Bounce from a supermassive black hole (SMBH) under Einstein-Cartan gravitation--then it seems possible to calculate the volume of this ur-object using the following method:

Assume all black holes have the same mass density.
Assume there is some median black holes size.
Assume every galaxy in our universe contains a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) at its center.
This means there are 2 trillion such objects (the same number as the number of galaxies).
Two trillion times the size (not mass) of the median SMBH gives us the volume of the ur-SMBH which can then expanded to include everything in our universe.
Packing that volume into a single object gives us (hopefull) the size of the Ur-SMBH.

What size is that?
