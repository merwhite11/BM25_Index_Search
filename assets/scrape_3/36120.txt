I can't see any detail through my telescope

I have a AILINK 114mm diameter, 900mm focal length, reflector telescope. I'm able to see the moon very well however, I can't see Planets very clearly 
The first two images are what I can see and the second two is what I want to see
Is that possible for my telescope also, how can I take better pictures like those examples. 
Note* it was pre windy and the image was a little better then in the picture
