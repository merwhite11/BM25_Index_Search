Observed instances of massive gas inflow and AGN restart due to cluster-cluster merger?

Works such as Acreman et al. (2003) have demonstrated via simulations the possibility of gas being stripped off a galaxy due to interaction with a galaxy cluster.
Have there been confirmed instances where a cluster-cluster merger led to the infall of huge amounts of gas onto one of the clusters? Further, have there been instances of cluster-cluster merger leading to restarting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity?
