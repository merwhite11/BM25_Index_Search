How fast was the Earth spinning directly after the Moon formed?

I understand the Moon was perhaps five Earth radii away when it first formed (assuming it was formed by a giant impact of a Mars-sized body), and Earth has since transferred its rotational energy into the moon's orbital energy. How fast would Earth have been spinning at the point the Moon was formed? Assuming it was spinning very fast (day under 10 hours) would this have caused a noticeable decrease in effective "gravity" at the equator? Presumably the Precambrian microbes could have reached equatorial orbit really easily, assuming they had a space program.
