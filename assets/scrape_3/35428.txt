Slope of log plot of luminosity-velocity in Tulley Fisher relation

My partner and I did some computation on the Tully Fisher relation at uni.
In that, the slope of the logarithm plot between the luminosity and rotational velocity, was 2.6.
Now, that slope corresponds to the exponent to which $v_{rotation}$ is raised to. i.e.
$$L=Av_{rotation}^b$$
where $b$ is the exponent.
So, $b$ officially is close to 4. And I have used up a sample size of over 10 galaxies. And the plot looked pretty shabby honestly. Is our result poor?
