Can the moon appear to be in any position in the sky?

It seems to me that the Moon has appeared in many locations - apparent locations - in the 'dome of the sky'. I know that the Sun follows an arc from east to west and that the arc is smaller in winter than in summer. Therefore the Sun cannot appear in every location in the 'dome of the sky'.
My question is: can the moon appear in any (every?) location in the 'dome of the sky'?
