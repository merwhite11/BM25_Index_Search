Moon's unusual gravity

We know that the Moon's gravity is about one-sixth that of Earth. Then I recently read that the mass of the Moon is about one-eightieth the mass of Earth. Since gravity depends on the mass of the 2 objects, shouldn't the Moon's gravity be one-eightieth the gravity of Earth? Is the Moon extra dense?
