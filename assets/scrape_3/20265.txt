Could there be massive charged “rivers” in interstellar space?

Some suggest that there might be currents of charged particles moving at 0.98c in interstellar space.  Since this is tainted by association with the crack “Electric Universe” cosmology, my first impression is to be dismissive of the possibility.
But, proponents point to current observations and ideas, so I thought I’d check on this claim in and of itself.  Given what we do know, are such currents possible or excluded?  And, if possible, could they be massive enough to propell a space craft bearing a large sail?
