Are there Earth rocks on Mars?

Certain meteorites found on Earth have been established to come from Mars: a giant impact ejected rocks from Mars, these rocks traveled through interplanetary space, and went through the Earth's atmosphere without completely burning up. 
Might it be possible to find a meteorite on Mars that comes from Earth from the same kind of mechanism? 
Earth's gravity is stronger than Mars', so I guess you would need a bigger impact to send debris into interplanetary space. And the atmosphere is thicker on Earth, so the impacting body would need to be even bigger for enough of it to touch the ground. And you also need to give the rocks more energy so that they can go outwards in the Sun's gravitational well. So I'm guessing that impacts that might be violent enough are rarer for the Earth than they are for Mars.
Might it be possible for there to be Earth meteorites on Mars? And if so, is there any chance that we might stumble upon one?
