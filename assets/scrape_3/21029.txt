Is night sky getting brighter day by day?

Night sky is dark because light from distant stars has yet not reached our earth. Light emitted by stars formed after the instant of creation i.e. 13.7 billion light years ago is on the way to reach us. As light from these distant stars reach us, night sky must keep getting brighter.
How true is this? And to what extent? Can one day night sky become as bright as a day?
