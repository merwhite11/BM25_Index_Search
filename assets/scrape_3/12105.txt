Super moon or Super lag?

On Sep 25 2015 in California, at 8pm the moon was observed between 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock position in the sky.
On Sep 26 at 8pm at the same location the moon appeared roughly between 11 o' clock and 12 o'clock position as night before.
On Sept 27 at 8pm same location the super moon was not between the 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock but seen at 9:30pm at the 9 o'clock way behind trajectory. What is the cause of this?
