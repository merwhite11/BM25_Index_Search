Could not slow neutrinos orbit galaxies and clusters, thus comprising a large component of even COLD dark matter?

Cold dark matter is the type of dark matter that is most eminently neutrino-free. But neutrinos themselves suffer a large survivorship detection bias (“all the neutrinos you can detect necessarily have to have relativistic speeds”) https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/267035/where-are-all-the-slow-neutrinos
By the same principle that there are more pebbles than boulders, and more red dwarfs than blue giants, slow neutrinos should be more abundant than the fast, detectable ones.
Non-relativistic (slow) neutrinos - in particular those going at below the galactic escape velocity - could be a major competent of cold dark matter: slow neutrinos could be slow enough to orbit galaxies and galactic clusters and thus form a significant amount of cdm, which should be shaped as a galactic halo.
If neutrinos are produced at all speeds, those stellar (modern) neutrinos below galactic escape velocity will accumulate indefinitely. This should generate a halo-shaped cloud, and this could comprise a large part (of course 15% are MACHOs etc https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept17/Freese/Freese4.html - I am assuming here a multi-component DM) of cold dark matter.
