What would the night sky have looked like 12.9 billion years ago when galaxies first started to form?

If I stood on a theoretical earth at the time that galaxies were just starting to form, what would the sky have looked like?
Due to the smaller size of the universe would it have been densely packed with objects? If yes, what might I have seen?

What would the night sky have looked like in 12,900,000,000 years BCE?
Prompted by Hubble's discovery of Earendel, what would the night sky have looked like back 12.9 billion years ago? (ignoring details like the Earth and humans not existing back then),
Apparently this star existed at 7% the age of the universe. Does this also mean the universe was 14 times smaller and 143=2700 times more dense than today? And the night sky would have been 142=200 times brighter? So nearby Galaxies would be much bigger and brighter with an apparent size of several degrees in the sky. Or would distinct, well-formed galaxies even be apparent at that time? What structures would be seen? What would the population of stars be like - lots of big blue ones or a bunch of little red ones? They'd obviously all be very young.
