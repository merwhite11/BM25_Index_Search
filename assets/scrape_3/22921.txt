Will universe's lakes get boiled by the CMBR?

From what I can understand, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) is microwave now, but was initially visible light emitted long time ago.

The microwave is producing a wave thatâ€™s about 12 centimeters long. 
Now CMBR has right now this (time changing) distribution (peak at 2mm):

So it looks to me that in some time, when its wavelength falls at around 12cm), some of its energy should be transferred to water molecules the way it is in a microwave oven. 

Is it the case? Will some of the CMBR energy actually transferred to water molecules? 
Will this energy be too faint to matter at our scale?
