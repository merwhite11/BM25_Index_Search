In rocky planets,does fast rotation cause flatting or low flatting imply slow rotation?

As far as I know, Venus and Mercury have 0 flatting, but Mars and Earth have detectable flatting, and Venus and Mercury are both rotating slowly. I'm confused as to the relation between rotational speed and flatting.
Does rotation cause a rocky planet to be flat? Or zero flatting implies Venus and Mercury rotate slowly? Which is correct?
