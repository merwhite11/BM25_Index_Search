Why Is The Expansion of The Universe Allowed To Move Faster Than Light?

Why is the expansion of the universe allowed to faster than light if everything that moves within a vacuum can't reach the speed limit of light?
I've read that astronomers looked at the distance between galaxies but I'm still not understanding what's going on. If objects in the universe can't go faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, how are galaxies (which objects within the universe) moving away from each other faster than light?
