Why can't we observe a solar eclipse and the preceding/following lunar eclipse from the same place?

Lunar and solar eclipses go in tandem so the two often happens two weeks apart.
However I noticed if there is a solar eclipse in my area then the preceding/following lunar eclipse is not visible from my area because the Moon is set when it happens.
Similarly when lunar eclipse is visible in my area, the corresponding solar eclipse is not visible at my area because the Sun is set.
Recently the same thing happens in July 2 when there were a total solar eclipse on the other side of Earth, and soon we will see a partial lunar eclipse from my area.
The only exception was when the eclipse happens near the sunrise or sunset.
For example on May 31 in 2003 a partial eclipse could be seen from Hungary at the morning when the Sun rose already partially eclipsed just few minutes before the maximum occultation.
Two weeks before that there was a total lunar eclipse where we could only see the beginning of the eclipse as the Moon was already set when totality occurred.
These eclipse pairs seem to occur almost exactly at the same time of day. 
Why?
