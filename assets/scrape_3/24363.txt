What should I expect to see with my telescope with what EP's?

Recently got a Celestron 130 SLT (first "real" scope) and have a question. I have the following:
130mm F/5 newtonian, 650mm focal length scope
9 and 25mm factory EP's (more on that later)
Svbony 2x barlow
Very, very dark skies (100 miles from any cities, out in the desert, light pollution maps show "zero light pollution" on the maps anywhere I view from once I'm 5 minutes from home). I don't have expensive glass, I don't know what I'm doing... but at least I have this going for me :-) 
4500 elevation with low mountains on either side, 10-25 miles away  (don't know that it matters) 
20/20 uncorrected vision (if that makes a difference)
I am curious what I should expect to be able to see with my scope, and at what magnification I should see them at? I plan to buy 3 EP's, and want to know the lowest and highest I should buy to see what I "should" be seeing. I don't want to pursue things that I won't be able to make out clearly anyways, or buy the wrong EP's for seeing those things. I see anywhere from 25 to 60 X your scope size, which is a wide range of mags. 
I have beautifully-dark skies, so I'm not sure if the EP has to do with light pollution also, or solely "seeing". 
Will I be able to make out cassini's division? Will I be able to complete the messier list? 
I have nothing in-person to compare my scope to, so I'm relying on random internet information, which tells me my max magnification is anywhere from 150 to 250, and varying features and objects that I will be able to see. Any input will be greatly appreciated. I plan to start the lunar observing program soon (LOVE the moon, mostly because of my spaceflight interest and occupation), and have only looked at the moon so far, along with learning my constellations. 
Thanks!
(PS, whatever EP's I buy, I am willing to spend up to 80 a piece, on 3 total new ones (or 2, the 25mm seems ok)
