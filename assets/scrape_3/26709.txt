What are the possible star fuels?

I always thought the only fuel for a star was hydrogen, which is fused into helium.
But while reading some questions and answers here in ASO, I saw phrases like "This balance stays relatively stable until the star runs out of whatever its current fuel is".
Besides hydrogen, what are the possible fuels in a starâ€™s core?
