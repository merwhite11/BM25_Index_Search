Deformable optics for consumer telescopes

I am aware that there are adaptive imaging techniques for amateur astronomers. But these methods correct an image on a screen. This is nice, but to me the real lure of amateur astronomy is the act of seeing an object through the eyepiece, not on some computer screen. Are there any deformable-mirror technologies available for consumer-grade telescopes that would allow for direct viewing of the object with correction?
