Can a planet have more that one ring?

Here is a good example picture of what I mean:

If not, why is this so? I've heard often that in the creation of a planet more the rings have formed, they are most likely just all over the place before they settle to the formation that we know, so why not come to a stable position in such a way. Note that the picture is only an example, rings that horizontal to each other are included too.
