What are these three black cap-like pieces?

My son received a secondhand telescope for his birthday. It is a Celestron Powerseeker 114AZ.
I found these three black cap-like pieces separate from other parts. I canâ€™t find what they are or what they do in the instruction manual.
What are they and what do they do?
