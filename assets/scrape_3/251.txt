What is the significance of the discovery of a pulsar flipping between radio and x-ray emissions?

This morning on the radio I heard about the discovery of a pulsar that, due to its proximity to a companion star, was flipping between a state where it emitted radio waves and one where it emitted x-rays. The flipping between states was said to be due to material from the companion star falling onto the pulsar, causing it to rotate more quickly.
