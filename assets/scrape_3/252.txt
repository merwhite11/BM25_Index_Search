How do I build a stargazing aficionado's Sun funnel to observe our nearest star safely?

How do I observe the Sun safely, with tools I could build myself and without breaking the bank? If I wanted to build a Sun funnel on my own and use it on my enthusiast grade telescope, how would I do that?
What supplies and tools would I need, how do I attach it to my telescope so it can be applied to it at will, and are there any other, simpler yet safe ways to observe the Sun and its activity with my telescope? This is approximately what I had in mind:
    
How do I build something like that? I'm primarily interested in observing sunspots, but would also like to know, if there is any way for me to safely observe Sun's coronal activity to any appreciable detail with an enthusiast grade newtonian/dobsonian telescope? 
Additionally, could I project the telescope's image directly on some screen behind it, without having to use any intermediary digital equipment, like a recording camera and a digital light projector?
