Star rotational axes and Solar system orientations

How does the orientation of stars axes of rotation and any planetary systems relate to the plane of the galaxy? Is there any relationship that has been detected, are they grouped from their parental nebulae. Do galactic magnetic fields have coherent orientations that would affect nebula growth and consequent stellar growth.
