The movement of the moon

I was in Cuba from January 15th to the 22nd this year and there was a quarter moon. If I use a compass to explain the orientation of the quarter moon, it started in the north position around 4 pm. By 7 pm, it was in the east position, and by 11 pm, it was in the south position. Normally the quarter moon would start in the east and end in the east as it travels across the sky.
Could someone please explain this phenomenon?
Thanks!
