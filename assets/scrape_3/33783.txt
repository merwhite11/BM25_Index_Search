What is the distance between the solar systems towards the center of galaxy?

The distance from our Solar System to the nearest is roughly 260,000 AU. I am wondering what is the minimum distance between two Solar Systems. Since the center of our galaxy is supposed to be more dense than the spiral on which our Solar System is situated, I am guessing that the distances between adjacent Solar Systems would be smaller. Please give quantitative figures and references to peer-reviewed journals if possible.
