Why do pulsars turn "off" from rotation?

I was looking at the Pulsar wikipedia article
and I came across an interesting aspect that said pulsars turn off from rotation:

When a pulsar's spin period slows down sufficiently, the radio pulsar mechanism is believed to turn off (the so-called "death line"). This turn-off seems to take place after about 10â€“100 million years, which means of all the neutron stars born in the 13.6 billion year age of the universe, around 99% no longer pulsate.

What I don't understand is why emission of EM waves would slow a pulsar down?
