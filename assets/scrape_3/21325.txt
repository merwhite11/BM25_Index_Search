Spiralling in Galaxy evolution

Could some stars be orbiting galaxies in outward spirals instead of perfectly round circulation? Patterns of matter movement relate strongly to the galaxy centre. A special relationship between the galaxy and the central object suggest the centre may be an origin point in 'outflow'. The BH central object behaves strangely by instigating the release outwardly of massive amounts of matter. This may form stars that spiral out across the galaxy. The grand design of features in galaxies may related to general outward spiralling.
