Description of Henyey tracks on wikipedia incorrect?

So, if you search for Henyey tracks on wikipedia (I know, the shame of it!) you will come across this statement: 

The Henyey track is characterized by a slow collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium. They are approaching the main sequence almost horizontally in the Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram (i.e. the luminosity remains almost constant).

Ignoring the bad grammar, I take umbrage with the following: 

the luminosity remains almost constant.

I would say that the apparent horizontal track associated with the Henyey track is more due to the fact that in a typical HR diagram the temperature axis ranges over about one order of magnitude, while the luminosity axis may vary over five or more orders of magnitude.
So, to frame this as a question, would you agree or disagree with the statement on the site or with what I have stated (i.e., that the Henyey track is an apparent horizontal track caused by the nuance in the magnitude scales of luminosity in comparison with the temperature)?
