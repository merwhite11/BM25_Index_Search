Black Hole, Object or Portal?

Some say that a black hole is a rip in space-time, a portal linking two points in the universe as one. How sound is this? I've read that when a giant star collapses, what is left behind (a massive neutron star?) is so dense that light cannot even escape its gravitational pull. Is this phenomenon caused by an actual object? If one were to travel into a black hole, should not one find only really dense matter?
