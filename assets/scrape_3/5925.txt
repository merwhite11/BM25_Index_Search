Are ascending node of sun, the point of intersection of prime meridian and equator and center of earth all collinear?

I did a bit of googling but couldn't find the exact answer, so are the following 3 points collinear or not ?
1_center of earth
2_ascending(or descending) node of sun
3_point of intersection of prime meridian and equator(point of zero longitude on equator).
