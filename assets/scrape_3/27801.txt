How does the center of a black hole can contain so much mass?

We know that 

"In the center of a black hole is a gravitational singularity, a
  one-dimensional point which contains a huge mass in an infinitely
  small space, where density and gravity become infinite and space-time
  curves infinitely, and where the laws of physics as we know them cease
  to operate."

So where does this mass go? A measure of how much matter is there in a object is called mass right? so how does that matter stays in a 1-D space?
We know that matter occupy space so how?
Edit: My question is about how can a singularity exists not about singularity itself.
