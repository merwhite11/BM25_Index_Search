Annual path polar chart for a star

I've often come across sun path charts like this (Wikimedia Commons) that show the position of the sun at any point of the year, at any time of day, for a specific location (or a set of locations), on an azimuth-elevation polar plot:

I'd like to get the exact same chart (or data, to create my own chart) for any given star, such as Aldebaran or Sirius, for a given point on Earth.
I'm looking into Stellarium scripting, as well as the HYG stellar database (I am not familiar with the mathematics of right ascension and declination, or how to convert this to azimuth-elevation like in the example). Is this a very unusual data product to ask for?
