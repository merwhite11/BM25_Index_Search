V838 Monocerotis "light-echo" images morphed into nice video, but why so few original images?

This NYTimes video shows what I think is a series of real Hubble images which have been "morphed" artistically to appear to be continuously expanding. (also see The V838 Monocerotis Star Still Has Astronomersâ€™ Heads Exploding) If I understand correctly it is the light-echo, not actual material that is doing the expanding at this rate. They also give four discrete images available in 2006 (shown below) and you can find a link to a video there which also seems to be made of just four images.
This is (very roughly speaking) tomography of the cloud - the parabolic "shell of reflection" expands and each image highlights a view of the material in that shell. That seems to be what the diagram illustrates.
my question is: why weren't there more images taken of this - technically speaking - awesome event, enough to make an animation without the artistic "morphing"? 
note: I'm not asking "why do you think there weren't...". I'm looking for the actual reason. Are these "found images" - nobody thought of doing it and later just pulled these from archives, or where these thought to be sufficient? Are there more images available?
Here are some links to video I have found
