Why do black holes choke?

I read that a black hole can sometime "choke" on a star:

"...the disrupted stellar matter was generating so much radiation
  that it pushed back on the infall. The black hole was choking on the
  rapidly infalling
  matter."

Why does a black hole choke? How do astronomers manage to observe this rare event?
