If you looked at Earth while travelling at relativistic speeds, will you see sped-up activities?

Suppose you traveled off Earth and back at relativistic speeds, so that when you come back much longer time elapsed on Earth than you experienced. Suppose you had an excellent telescope through which you could observe the details of the surface of the Earth down to human scale, all the time.  
What will you see?  Will you see people moving incredibly fast? Will you see people progressing from birth to old age in a matter of seconds?
