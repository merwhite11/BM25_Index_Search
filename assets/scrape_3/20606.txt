Blood Moon Identification in NASA reports

Often I look at NASA's Eclipse Web Site. More specifically, I often look at the Index to Five Millennium Catalog of Lunar Eclipse. How can I tell if an eclipse results in a "blood moon"? I know not all lunar eclipses result in a blood moon, but I do know that some do. So how can I know if one is from looking at it? A blood moon is the phenomenon whereby the moon in total eclipse appears reddish in color as it is illuminated by sunlight filtered and refracted by the earth's atmosphere. (Google)
Edit:
James K says this question may be a duplicate of another question. I want to know how to identify "blood moons" from looking at NASA's reports. The other question is more general. However the answer may be the same.
