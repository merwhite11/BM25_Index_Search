Can we observe the Milky Way on the edge of the universe?

If you traveled outward and outward in a straight line, indefinitely and pugnaciously, you would never arrive at an outer boundary. Instead, you would come back to where you began.
Hence, in the same manner, can we assume to be able to observe the Milky Way in the long distance, anywhere in space, given the right time and technology? It would be the past version of our self, of course, but is it possible theoretically or practically?
