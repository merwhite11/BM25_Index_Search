How long does it take the center of the Earth to complete a full orbit?

If we take midnight of 1/1/2017 in any country and mark in space where the center of the Earth is located, at what date, in the same country, has the center completed a full orbit.
I am almost certain that has to be 1/1/2018, but I am not so sure about the hour.
