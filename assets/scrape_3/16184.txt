Would the (orbitting) speed of the Earth change if suddenly the sun disappear and the Earth is thrown into space?

Usually an orbit is considered as an acceleration. So if the Earth has a speed of about 100.000km/h around the sun. 
Now I think there is some relativity involved, so from which point of view shall we observe those speeds? But lets imagine that we stand on mars which stays still compared to the Earth and the sun, only the Earth is moving. 
Shall we measure a different speed when the Earth is thrown into space? Would it be more of less than 100.000km/h? Or is there something missing?
