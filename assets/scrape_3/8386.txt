Basic DIY Telescope

I am looking for a design of a cheap and easy telescope to build with my 9yo daughter with the only basic requirement being that I'd love to be able to see detail on the moon.  Looking around, there seems to be a wide variety of either extremely simple or very advanced (to me) options.  I've seen this post and this post, but they look a bit advanced.  I am hoping for something as basic as possible (i.e. that we can construct in an afternoon or two) that does not come from a kit.  This site has an option, but I imagine that's simply unpractical.  Is there anything else that anyone would recommend to get started?
