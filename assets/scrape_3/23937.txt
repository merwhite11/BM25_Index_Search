How was Jupiter formed

Two days ago I went to a mathematics conference where there was a paper presented on Jupiter's formation via the disk-instability model.
I know that there are two different theories for the formation of the planets. One of them is the Core accretion model and the other one is the disk-instability model. I also tried to read this paper on planetary formation in which they said 161 planets were put on to test. 90% followed Core accretion model and rest of them followed the later model. Did not say anything explicit about Jupiter.
Jupiter is too close to the Sun to follow the Disk-Instability model (I am not sure completely).
Now I want to know which model Jupiter follows for its formation.
(I asked this question on physics stack-exchange too but unfortunately there were no answers)
