Why is only a narrow chunk of sky darkened in this amazing Curiosity solar eclipse GIF from Mars?

I found three NASA JPL images in the sequence PIA23133, PIA23134, and PIA23135. They were taken by the Curiosity Rover on Mars and show solar eclipses by Mars' two moons. 
Details of these images are given in this answer to Puzzler: help understanding these amazing Curiosity eclipse GIFs 
Question: Why is it that it's mostly a chunk of the right half of the sky that darkens during the eclipse in PIA23135? 
Is this kind of effect visible in solar eclipses seen on Earth?
Enquiring minds want to know!
fyi in case you are wondering, per @MarkAdler's ultra-concise answer

They use neutral-density filters to look at the Sun, which reduce the light by a factor of 100,000. The two Pancam cameras each have one neutral-density filter, with the left one filtering blue and the right one filtering red.
