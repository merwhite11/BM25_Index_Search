What is the Northernmost Latitude of Saturn?

My wife and I were watching a TV show last night, which takes place in Salem, Massachusetts circa 1693.  One character went to a particular place in the woods at a particular time to be exactly under Saturn.  I told my wife that Saturn could never be exactly above such a Northern latitude.
What is the Northernmost Latitude that Saturn could possibly be above?  By "above", I mean if you draw a line through the center of the Earth and through Saturn, the point on the Earth's surface that line passes through.
Also, how often would it reach that point?  Would it be every few years, or every few thousand years?
