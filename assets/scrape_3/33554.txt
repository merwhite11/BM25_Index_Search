Universe expansion

I'm reading the book "The theory of everything". In the second chapter it says the Universe is expanding, and we know this because the measurements made using the Doppler effect of other galaxies gives redshifted signals. My question is, There are no galaxies behind us in this expansion? I mean, if all the galaxies are moving farther away from us all the time, does this mean that the center of the universe is empty? or are the galaxies behind us slower so the redshift effect is smaller?
