Is the diamond ring effect visible in a 40mm hydrogen alpha telescope?

I'm going to Nebraska for the 2017 eclipse, and am weighing my options. I'm considering whether to pack my 40mm Coronado PST or to make a Baader AstroSolar filter for my 66mm William Optics apo. I've used the PST for transits and annular eclipses past, but have never seen a total solar eclipse before.
Can I see the diamond ring effect (aka Baily's beads) with my PST, or should I stick with white light?
