Would exoplanets like those of Kepler-70 possess magnetic fields?

The B-type subdwarf, Kepler-70  (aka KIC 5807616) is believed to have two planets orbiting it, at average distances 0.006 AU and 0.0076 AU (source). Due to their proximity to their parent star, they are almost certainly tidally locked to it (although I don't know if tidal forces between the planets themselves might counter this, since they apparently pass within a few hundred thousand miles of each other and have short orbital periods.)
Now, the "day side" of each of these planets would have surface temperatures exceeding that of the Sun! (i.e. > 6000 K.) If, indeed, they are tidally locked, we might also expect a significant temperature difference between the "night" and "day" sides. The planets are believed to be the rocky/iron cores of gas giants that were engulfed when their parent star expanded. If I have understood the paper by Nordhaus et al. correctly, the gas giants would have had to be significantly larger than Jupiter. Certainly, however, the Chthonian planets that they turned into are now hot enough for metal/rock to be evaporating on at least one side, and possibly both. It would seem unlikely that they would be mostly solid.
If this is correct, then:

We have two planets, each mostly liquid/gaseous, with significant temperature differences between different regions. So it looks to me as though there would be convection.
If the planets have significant metallic content, they would also be conductive.
They are certainly also rotating, at the speed required to keep one side continuously facing the star.

Am I correct, therefore, that they probably have magnetic fields generated by the dynamo effect? Or is there some factor, possibly related to the extraordinarily high temperatures involved (or my own lack of knowledge :-) ) that would imply otherwise?
