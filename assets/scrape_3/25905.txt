How do I obtain the brightness of a star in the night sky?

I am planning to conduct a research which involves observing the brightness of a star. So far, I haven't been able to obtain much information as to how I may go forward with the observation process. I'm willing to buy a telescope and other equipment. What telescopes are ideal for this and what other equipment must I require to obtain the apparent brightness value of the star?
