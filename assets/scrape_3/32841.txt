First spectroscopic detection of Uranus' rotation?

As an undergraduate exercise quite a while ago, we placed the equator of Jupiter's disk across the slit of a high resolution grating spectrometer and then measured the tilt of the resulting line in order to estimate Jupiter's rotational velocity.

When was an experiment of this type first performed for Uranus? 
What was the result? Did it make sense at the time? Was Uranus' 98 degree axis tilt appreciated?
