What I can observe with a 80/900 refractor telescope? What can I study?

Recently I bought a telescope after a very good conversation with an astronomer friend of mine. The main goal is to see planets.
However, Mars is so difficult and is far to find it in opposition. I really like the views of the Moon and there is where I spend most of my time observing. But I really want to go view the planets, but I seem a bit without an objective. I don't want only to see them at random; I want to do some kind of study using my observations. So, can you suggest something to do with my telescope to start some serious study?
I have a good base of Physics (I'm a computer engineer) and I really like Math, but I'm a complete amateur in astronomy.
