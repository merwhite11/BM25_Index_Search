What if one teleportes to a star that is some light years away?

When we see a star from the earth that is 5 light years away, we are essentially looking at light emitted from the star 5 years ago. What if you were to instantly reach near the star, either by teleportation or Alcubierre drive, are you traveling back in time 5 years?
