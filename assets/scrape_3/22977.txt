Why is Enceladus the only geologically active moon among its neighbours?

My understanding of why Enceladus is geologically active is that tidal forces from Saturn and - to a lesser extent - from the nearby larger moon Dione provide heat to the moon's interior, just like Jupiter does for Io. 
Should the other mid-to-large-sized moons Mimas, Tethys, Dione and Rhea not also exhibit similar activity from the same forces? Granted, Dione and Rhea are further from Saturn and thus less susceptible to tidal stresses, but what about Tethys and Mimas? What special attributes does Enceladus possess that has allowed it to be geologically active in modern times? Is it purely down to the fact that the interior of Enceladus is more ice than rock compared to the other moons, or are there more factors to consider?
