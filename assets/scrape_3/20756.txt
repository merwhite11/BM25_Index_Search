Spacing of G and K class stars

I was looking at the Wikipedia article "List of potentially habitable exoplanets" and I noticed that many of the closest planets listed(tens or hundreds instead of thousands of light-years away) orbited M-class stars. I have also read that scientists are more certain about the possibility of habitable planets around G and K class stars, because the habitability of red dwarf systems is still debated. I was wondering whether there is something that makes the larger stars be farther away from each other, or whether it is just a coincidence. So is it possible to have many G and K class stars tens of light years near each other?
