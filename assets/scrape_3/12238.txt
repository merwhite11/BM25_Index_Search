White dwarf's impact on orbiting bodies

Recently the Kepler telescope in its study of white dwarfs detected the first planetary object transiting a white dwarf in the data from the K2 mission. It was consistent with earlier theories' prediction that a planetary object orbiting a white dwarf would slowly disintegrate. Why would a planetary object that is orbiting a white dwarf disintegrate? I read it here.
