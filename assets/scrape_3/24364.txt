calculating paralax angle from observations

Say I have 2 records, in horizontal coordinates of the azimuth ($A_z,A_z^{'}$) and altitude ($\alpha,\alpha^{'}$) of the moon at the same time in two different places that are $\theta$ degrees apart (taking the angle from the centre of the earth and assuming the earth is a perfect sphere). Is it possible to calculate the parallax angle of the moon between these two points with only the values above? if so how and if not what other values would I need?
