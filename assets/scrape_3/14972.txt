How many planets does Omicron Persei have?

Omicron Persei is a binary star. I did not find information on how many planets it has and if we can actually determine it currently. However, I do know that most stars have planets orbiting around them and so I assume there are such planets.
For those who are interested, Futurama featured the planet Omicron Persei 8 - the 8th planet in that system. I was curious as to if there is an 8th planet.
