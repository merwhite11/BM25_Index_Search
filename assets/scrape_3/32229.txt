Using emission lines to determine redshift of a quasar

I am attempting this past paper question and am not sure how to tackle this, this is not homework! :)

The spectrum of a distant quasar shows two broad emission lines with observed
  wavelengths of 317.7nm and 404.7nm. The strongest lines are most likely to be either Lyman-Î± with a rest wavelength 121.6nm, CIV with a rest wavelength of 154.9nm or MgII with a rest wavelength of 280.0nm.
(a) What is the redshift of the quasar? Please show your working.
(b) What two lines have been detected?
(c) The two lines have widths of 10nm and 20nm respectively. If I have measured
  the mass of the black hole in the quasar to be 10^9Msun, how far from the centre of the quasar are the regions of ionised gas responsible for the emission lines?
  Please specify any assumptions that you make to obtain your result.

I am assuming I must find z to be the ratio of the change in wavelength to the rest wavelength. However I'm unsure of how to identify these in the question.
