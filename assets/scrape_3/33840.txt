How are the atomic clocks synchronised between worldwide VLBI telescopes?

I know that VLBI needs precise synchronised atomic clocks to calculate the baseline distance between the radio telescopes at cm level. But i cantÂ´t find any information how the atomic clocks are kept synchronised over long distances (several thousand kilometres around the world). As far as i know GPS is not accurate enough.... How are atomic clocks kept synchronised on all VLBI telescopes ?
Thanks a lot :)
