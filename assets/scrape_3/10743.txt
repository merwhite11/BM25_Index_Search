Globular cluster star density as a function of distance from the center

Context: I want to simulate globular clusters in a simple way, just to display the positions of stars. 
Assuming isotropy, what would be a reasonable model of the stellar number density as a function or r, the distance from the center of the cluster?
I'm assuming that such a model would have some free parameters as well.
