How dark/bright are polar nights?

During the polar night directly at the pole the Sun sets once and—after a period of twilight—stays down for months at a time.
The only sources of non-human-made light are the stars, the auroras, and the sunlight reflected by the moon.
Yet when I see various photos of, for example, Amundsen-Scott base during this period, the sky (and the ground illuminated by it) is often quite bright. Here is a timelapse of August, which should be way outside even the civil twilight for this period: https://youtu.be/cf14SL7m8Ys
Is there an issue with photo-sensitivity of the cameras?
Are these sources of illumination actually bright enough to turn the middle of the night into something more twilight-like (if not day-like) when perceived by a human eye? If so, how much of the polar night is actually dark, percentage-wise?
