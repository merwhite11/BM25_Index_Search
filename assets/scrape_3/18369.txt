Is there evidence for the speed of gravity?

Is it an assumption that the speed of propagation of gravitational waves is exactly the same as the speed of light? If the speed of gravity is only slightly less than the speed of light, the effect might not show up over solar or intra galactic distances, but over extragalactic distances could it give the appearance that there is dark matter influencing motion?
