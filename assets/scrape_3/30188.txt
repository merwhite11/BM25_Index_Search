Do white dwarfs produce stellar wind? If not, why is that?

I've been told white dwarfs don't produce stellar wind like the sun produces solar winds. I don't quite understand why that is and can't really find any evidence that confirms or denies that. 
My understanding is that solar wind is the product of the sun's variable magnetic field and consists of charged particles. Does nuclear fusion have to be occurring at the star's core for these charged particles to exist?
