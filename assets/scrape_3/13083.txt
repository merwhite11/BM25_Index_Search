Is there any real chance of getting hit with a meteorite if we build a base on the moon?

I've been reading an article today on how the European Space Agency (ESA) has an interest in building a space village on the moon which will be 3D printed and assembled by robots. Eventually people will start to go there for long periods of time (presumably).
I always think to myself when hearing such news or watching a sci-fi movie, isn't there a real chance that it will get hit by a meteorite?

Here's a video of their plan to build a moon village as they call it:
