Moons of migrated giant planets: Icy, Rocky, or none at all?

My understanding is that gas and ice giants form outside the "snow line" of their protoplanetary disk, then sometimes through gravitational interactions they are able to migrate into the inner star system. 
In this situation, if the giant planet had moons, what would they be like?

Would the planet be able to bring initial moons with it? Or would they be lost?
If they are kept, are they likely to retain an icy composition due to forming outside the snowline?
If not, can it form or capture new moons post-migration?
