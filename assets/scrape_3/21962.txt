I need help using this telescope!

The telescope I'm using is a National Geographic 76 Diameter, 700 focal length, Equatorial Mount.
It's hard to use the equatorial mount, as this is my first telescope it's hard to use.
Everything I see is upside down.
I don't know how to polar align my telescope.
I don't know how to make move the telescope around properly because of this EQ mount.
Any help would be really appreciated
I watched videos of people aligning their finderscope but i don't even know how to move mine let alone align it.
