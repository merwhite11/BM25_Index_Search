How can Halley's Comet be predictable?

How can we know that Halley's Comet is going to come again every 76 years? I understand that the comet has an orbit around the sun but how can scientists know that it won't be thrown off course for example by passing Jupiter and Jupiters gravity giving it a tug in a different direction? Its not a very big object in space so it seems to me that its orbit could be changed very easily.
