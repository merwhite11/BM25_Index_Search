"Supernova" is the explosion or the resulting celestial body? Is it incorrect to call the explosion "supernova"?

Sorry for such a newbie question. I searched and read multiples sources about supernova but I'm not completely sure if what is called "supernova" is the explosion, the resulting celestial body or the event as whole (explosion plus resulting celestial body).  
Would it be considered as incorrect if for some reason the explosion of a star is called as "supernova"?
