Is there a limit to how hot a star can be?

I think that size and mass do not correlate to temperature, but then again these factors contribute to the internal pressure. 
I would like to know if there is a limit to how hot a star can get and what mechanism(s) could drive a star to get unusually hot. 
I also know that negative temperature occurs in laser is hotter than a positive temperature, and can a star produce negative temperature?
