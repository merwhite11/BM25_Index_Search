Question from a non-astronomer /non-mathematician regarding rotation speeds

I have been watching too much TV related to black holes.  Most black holes are depicted with a disk of matter that spirals into the black hole. Does the mass and diameter of the disk have a bearing on the rotational speed, maximum rotational speed of a black hole? Also, do black holes have gravity? It looks like they must in order to collect matter. Does the gravity of a black hole create gravitational waves much as the electromagnetic waves created around the earth?  Do these waves have any influence on the speed of the black hole's rotation. What about if the rotation if the black hole is not symmetric?
