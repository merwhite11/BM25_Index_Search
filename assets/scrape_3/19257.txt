Are all gas planets guaranteed to produce their own magnetic field?

All gas giants in the solar systems have two things in common: abundant hydrogen gas and a magnetic field.
I'm wondering: could there be a gas planet that somehow can't produce any magnetic field on its own?
I learned there many kinds of bizarre and unfamiliar worlds from reading up terrestrial exoplanets and moons, so I thought maybe there is a unique gas planet that doesn't produce any magnetic field - or maybe the magnetic field disappeared after a while.
BTW I'm aware of hydrogen becoming metallic under a specific condition.
