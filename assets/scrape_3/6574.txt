Venus started with retrograde rotation?

I have heard that when our solar system formed that all planets except Venus were revolving around the sun in the same direction because of the normal rotation of their axes. Venus was rotating and revolving backwards or retrograde. There was a collision with Venus that caused it to rotate and revolve normally.
But why would a planet revolve backwards around a star relative to all the other planets in the stellar system?
