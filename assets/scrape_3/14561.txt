How do I see Deep Sky Objects in my telescope?

I just bought a new telescope. I tried it out, and I even woke up at 3am when the moon set so there was light pollution. I have an 8 inch dobsonian telescope with a focal length of 1200 mm. For some reason, I only see points of light in the sky, except for the moon and Jupiter and the Orion Nebula. 
My goal is to complete a messier marathon, but first I need to be able to see the Messier objects. So my question is, what is the best way to look for Deep Sky Objects with my telescope? And how much does light pollution get in the way of looking for them? For reference, I live in the northern United States.
