Do all objects get larger in an "expanding universe"?

I'm envisioning an analogy of the universe as a plane with marbles in that plane to represent different planets.
Now, if this plane expands how does this work? I assume that it is not like 'nothing' becomes 'something' then but rather expanding/stretching the universe; but doesn't this imply that everything around us is actually stretching/becoming bigger (like every atom/quarks) becomes a little bit bigger? Or is it just the space between those subatomic particles and combinations of these become bigger? 
An example could be the structure of carbon dioxide becoming larger, but only because there is more space between the carbon and the oxygen atoms.
