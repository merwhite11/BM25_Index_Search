Where does the CO2 in Mars atmosphere come from?

As far as I know, Earth and Mars were relatively similar when the solar system formed. So most of the CO2 was used to form carbonic rocks (right?). I found that tectonic movements are the reason that the CO2 on Earth could be released again, which don't exist on Mars. 
So how comes that the atmosphere has 95% CO2?
