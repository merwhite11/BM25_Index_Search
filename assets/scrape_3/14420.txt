Which class of objects in Solar System carries more mass?

Could you help me sorting this list in terms of total mass carried by these classes of objects?

The star (Sun) - it's very big but only one.
The planets (incl. dwarf planets). Certainly beaten by the Sun, but...
the asteroids, meteorites, comets, all that rubble. They aren't heavy individually but there's a lot of them.
the interplanetary medium. It's very low density, but it overshadows the rest by far in terms of volume occupied.

I'm not sure where to attach the moons - some of them are larger than some dwarf planets, some are definitely more asteroid-sized. I guess - whoever decides to answer this, is free to pick where they'd like to include the moons (or maybe to split them between the two classes, say, attaching the ones with hydrostatic equilibrium to dwarf planets, and bundling the rest with the rubble)?
