Do more objects appear on sky in time?

I would assume that, with light from more distant areas in space reaching the earth, we should be able to see more distant (and older) objects.
However there's lot of weird stuff regarding the space expansion that could eventually make the objects leaving us so fast the we'd never see them.
So, did we reach any boundary of what we can possibly see, or are we still working on more sensitive exploration devices?
I'll be grateful for some useful re-tag
