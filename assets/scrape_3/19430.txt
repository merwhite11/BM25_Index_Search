How does this comet have alcohol in it?

Recently I read about comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy).The thing got me amazed was that scientists found it was dumping ethyl alcohol all along its way, at a rate of around 300-500 bottles per second. So I want to ask how common is alcohol in outer space, and how did it form? I usually imagine space as an inert mixture of dry dust and light gases but it turns out there are sometimes alcoholic compounds.
