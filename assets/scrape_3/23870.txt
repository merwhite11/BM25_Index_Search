How to to compute the expected number of collisions between stars when Milkyway and Andromeda merged?

Can some one tell me how you can roughly estimate the number of collisions when Milkyway and Andromeda merged with each other. I know it is somehow related to the mean free path of the star. But couldn't figure out how to do it exactly.
