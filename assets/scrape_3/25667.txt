In a planetary system close to the galactic core, would it be possible to see the supermassive black hole?

I understand that radiation on planets near the galaxy’s center make life on these planets nearly impossible, and that one cannot truly “see” a black hole. However, if you could stand on the surface of a planet that orbits a star close to or within the galactic core, could you theoretically look up at the sky and see an absence of light/stars indicating the location of the central supermassive black hole?
Would it be too far away to see, obstructed by debris, or too small to notice?
