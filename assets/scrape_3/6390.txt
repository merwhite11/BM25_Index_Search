Is there enough hydrogen left after a star dies so another star will have enough to light up?

A star consumes quite a lot of hydrogen in its life, and is pretty much "vacuuming" everything in its vicinity. After it dies (eventually by supernova which will spread all its composition over light years), is there enough hydrogen left in that area to light up a new star? And will that star be more short-lived compare to its predecessor?
