The furthest horizon in the Solar system

Where can I observe the furthest horizon in the Solar system ? And what the length of it ?
The furthest horizon on Earth can be observed from mount Everest ~ 336 km, On Mars - from mount Olympus ~ 386 km.
Edit: If the walls of the Rheasilvia crater can be seen from the opposite sides (it appears so) you can see the surface as far as 505 km.
