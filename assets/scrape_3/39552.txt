Is lithium considered a metal in astronomy?

My lecture notes are conflicting on this issue so I seek definitive clarification. In Astronomy, are metals either
A: the elements which form within stars (i.e., not Big Bang nucleosynthesis, where most of the lithium (Li) was formed as far as I know)
or
B: everything heavier than helium (He)?
