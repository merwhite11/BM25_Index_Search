Need help with telescope mount; stars have tails

If I take a shot longer than 20 seconds, the stars get a tail. I have a Celestron Advanced GT mount with starshoot autoguide scope. I use a cannon can on a 9" Celestron scope. I can't get a picture without having tails on my stars. It only looks good if I keep the pictures under 20 seconds.
EDIT :
I did the polar alignment. The mount has a polar alignment scope threw the center of it. It's also balanced, the mount has a brids eye level. I use the new PhD software with the starshoot autoguide.. There is no slop in the mount, the gears have almost no backlash.
