Why do we keep orbiting through the Perseid meteors?

I understand that the meteors originated from the the comet Swiftâ€“Tuttle. Presumably they left the comet with some velocity relative to the solar system. As comets follow elliptical orbits presumably the meteors are generally also following an elliptical orbit. And as the earth follows a circular orbit, why do we keep meeting them every year despite being on different orbits?
