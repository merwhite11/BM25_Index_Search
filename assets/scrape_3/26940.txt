Changes of the velocity of the Moon due to impacts from other objects?

Has the moon’s velocity changed since ‘shortly’ after it’s formation due to impacts? 
Wouldn't it be likely that a significant collision would have occurred over such a long period of time? 
It would seem an object with enough momentum to change the velocity of the Moon would have made an impact on its velocity at some point over the millennia.
