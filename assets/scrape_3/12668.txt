A black hole that doesn't take in matter?

According to List of Common Misconceptions by Wikipedia, under the heading of astronomy, this line can be found: 

A black hole can act like a "cosmic vacuum cleaner" and pull a
  substantial inflow of matter, but only if the star it forms from is
  already having a similar effect on surrounding matter.

This is referenced to a paper written in Yale university:  "Frontiers And Controversies In Astrophysics Transcript 9", although that's a dead link. By linking so, I believe that it is a reliable source.
This got me thinking that is there a black hole that doesn't suck in surrounding matter? And is there a star that don't take in surrounding matter?
