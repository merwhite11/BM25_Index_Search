Latest cosmological parameters

I'm looking for the latest values (with uncertainties) of the four main cosmological density parameters $\Omega_i$ :
\begin{align}\tag{1}
\Omega_{\text{mat}} &={} ?,
&\Omega_{\text{rad}} &={} ?,
&\Omega_{\Lambda} &={} ?,
&\Omega_{k} &={} ?.
\end{align}
I know that $\Omega_{\text{mat}} \approx 0.30$, $\Omega_{\text{rad}} \approx 0.00$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} \approx 0.70$ and $\Omega_{k} \approx 0.00$, but I would like to have more precise values (with uncertainties, if possible).  Take note that these parameters are constrained by the following relation :
\begin{equation}\tag{2}
\Omega_{\text{mat}} + \Omega_{\text{rad}} + \Omega_{\Lambda} + \Omega_{k} \equiv 1.
\end{equation}
Of course, I checked Wikipedia but I don't trust it very much: Lambda-CDM model,
I've also checked on arXiv.  For example: Planck 2015 results. XIII. Cosmological parameters,
but I don't find clear final and consensual values in this paper.
Help would be appreciated.  Please state your sources.
