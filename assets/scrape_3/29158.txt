Computing the local orbital frame vector directions in a geocentric reference frame

In the context of the study of a cubesat (little satellite), I am asked to define the local orbital frame and compute the local orbital frame vector directions as a function of time :
Here the context :

Anyone could give me some tracks or links to find the answer of part 2.1 Local orbital frame ? this would be kind.
