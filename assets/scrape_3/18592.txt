When the moon eclipses the sun what direction is darkened first: left or right?

I saw the question and answer for the explanation of the direction of the moon's eclipse from left to right, but what about the direction of the moon as it passes over or between Earth and the sun?
Does the moon always pass from the right to the left or from the left to the right as it covers the sun; if you live above the equator?
Or does this change? Can it change? August 2017 the USA will have a total eclipse of the sun for the first time in decades.
