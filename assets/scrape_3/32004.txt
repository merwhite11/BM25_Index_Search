Why a blue spot in some hubble images of NGC 4302?

In some images with coloring like in this one: 

There is a noticeably bluer region in the "bottom left" of the image, and the bottom part of the galaxy on the left. Being an inexperienced galaxy viewer, I can't figure out what to make of it.
Is the spectrum of that region more complex than it seems? What is it?
