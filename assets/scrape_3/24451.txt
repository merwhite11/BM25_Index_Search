If one galaxy were to collide with another, what would it look like to an immortal inhabitant of one of their planets?

I was reading this article posted on /r/space about photographing black holes, and they showed a picture of what's believed to be two black holes formed from two galaxies colliding.
I didn't realize the collision of galaxies could result in black holes, but it got me wondering. If you lived in one of those galaxies, what would happen to you? Would your planet be destroyed in the blink of an eye at some point? If so, when?
Would the sky gradually fill with more and more stars? If your galaxy became a black hole, how would you experience that? All at once or very gradually?
