What are the implications if the Sun was formed in a warm nebula?

Molecular oxygen O2 has been found on comet 67P/C-G in a ratio of 3.8% to water, which is much higher than expected. An explanation proposed is that the Solar System formed from a molecular cloud warmer at 45 K, than typical molecular clouds at 10 K. I speculate this could have had many kinds of consequences for the Solar System and wonder what the most important or easiest to detect would be.
For example, my uneducated guess would be that more hydrogen escapes from warmer clouds. Exoplanets with low density could then be the result of higher hydrogen abundance, more frequently than here giving them large hydrogen atmospheres.
