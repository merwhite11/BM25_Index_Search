Can the Moon provide momentum to an object in Earth's orbit? Gravity Assisted Boost

Can a satellite maintain an equatorial orbit around Earth near the Moon's orbit to receive partial gravitational boosts by gaining momentum as the satellite passes though the Moon's gravity well? 
I'm not asking about hanging out in the Lagrange points, but passing between the L2 point and the Moon or the Moon and Earth aligned, in a Moon assisted orbit.
