Binary Star Initial Speed

I am writing a 2D simulation for binary stars orbiting each other. Currently, the initial position of the stars are on opposite sides of the screen with the left star having a velocity up the page and the right star having an equivalent velocity down the page.
The question I have is there a formula for calculating what that initial speed should be so that the stars remain in a stable orbit? Optimally, the formula would take into account the mass of the stars (which are equivalent), the distance apart, and G.
My apologies if this question would be better directed elsewhere or if I overlooked the answer in my own research.
Thank you for your help.
