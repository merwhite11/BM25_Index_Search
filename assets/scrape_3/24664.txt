Can my Sky Watcher Infinity 76P "make the sky bright" & do I want it to?

I've seen quite a few time-laps films where the Milky Way is seen as bright and filling the sky, as some fantastic glowing cloud full of glittering stars.
I wonder if it is possible to see this (or something a little similar) through a telescope using my eyes (not a camera)? 
It seems to me that you would want as little magnification as possible to see the sky like this, and it would be all about gathering as much light as possible? This answer describes this scenario as "Low Brightness" (and low resolution) objects.
I have a Sky Watcher Infinity 76P telescope. At the moment, it has a 30x erecting lens that tends to wobble in its helical mount, and doesn't give a good image. I've read claims that with a non erecting lens and a bit of care, this telescope can give good images.

Are non magnifying lenses available for the Sky Watcher? Or would I be better off taking a different approach completely, such as buying binoculars?
I'd like to be able to share this with my children, and they find the existing Sky Watcher lens hard to use â€“ as well as its wobble, I think this is because it has a narrow "exit pupil" (?), so that you need to get your eye in just the right place. Can I get a low magnification lens that is more forgiving for the user?
Can I expect to be able to see something from my backyard in a small UK town? Some of the shots in that film I link to seem to show clear bright sky pictures when there are other sources of light on the ground, or even the setting sun.

Many thanks.
