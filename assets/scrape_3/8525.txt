Can magnetism escape a black hole?

I know light, and practically nothing but gravity can escape a black hole.  My question is: can magnetism escape a black hole?  
A couple things that convince me it can are:

Jupiter's magnetic field shape compared with the jets that can come from near black holes (I would think this might push material falling toward a black hole into or out of the poles):



Apparently black holes have very strong magnetic fields:
