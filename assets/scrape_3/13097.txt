What part of the milky way do we see from earth?

When looking up at the night sky, we can sometimes observe a bright band of stars stretching across it. I know this is our galaxy but exactly what are we looking at? 

Could we look at the centre of the galaxy or is there another spiral arm blocking our view?
How does our view change as earth rotates around the sun? (E.g. What part of the milky way do we see in a winter night sky)
