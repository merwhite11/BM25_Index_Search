How actively is Deep Learning being used in exoplanet identification?

Papers, like this one from Google, show that Deep Learning and Machine Learning are effective in detecting exoplanets from luminosity data provided by telescopes like TESS or Kepler.
These models seem extremely quick and lightweight. Has it become somewhat of a standard practice to use these on freshly obtained TESS data? If not, why, and what is done with the data instead? Are there drawbacks to using these seemingly accurate models?
