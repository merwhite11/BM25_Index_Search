How did astronomers determine the path of 'Oumuamua so quickly?

The interstellar asteroid 'Oumuamua was discovered on October 19, 2017. Once discovered, less than a month's worth of precovery observations were found on various sky surveys. By mid-November, scientists had worked out its orbital eccentricity, and soon after its probable origin and destination.
With such a quick visit and so little data, how did scientists figure out so quickly where it came from and where it was going? Did using space probes for observations impart enough parallax to easily determine that, or did Earth-based observation have enough parallax themselves?
