Is it possible to revive the Mars geodynamo?

I’ve done a bit of reading and have found multiple theories suggesting how the Mars geodynamo stopped fully working.
This site suggests that one possibility could be volcanic activity ejecting water and other necessary elements from the mantle significantly slowed the natural convection process.
Where as this site says that it also could have been massive asteroids colliding with the surface, heating the planet up to temperatures that would disrupt convection. 
No one is quite certain what happened, all that is known is Mars doesn’t have much of a magnetic field at this point.
Today I saw that there’s an idea to create an artificial field that’ll act in place of a geodynamo’s naturally generated one.
My main concern for this is that the units creating the artificial field could be destroyed and the entire planet would become unstable afterwards.
It would seem if the magnetic field is supported by the planet itself, it would offer a higher degree of stability and less involvement for humans in the long run. 
What’s the possibility for ‘restarting’ the Mars geodynamo or perhaps ramping it up enough to support a strong enough field? And if so, how would we be able to do it?
