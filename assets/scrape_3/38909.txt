How long between the moment a meteor is first visible and the moment a meteorite hits the ground?

A meteor is usually only visible for a couple seconds at most, but I would guess that it usually stops being visible high above the ground.
Meteors often don't make it to the ground as they completely burn up before. But among those that do reach the ground, how long does it take for a meteoroid to go through the Earth's atmosphere and hit the ground? How many seconds between the moment it is first visible and the moment it hits the ground?
