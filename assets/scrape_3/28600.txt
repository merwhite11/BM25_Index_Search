Is there likely other significant objects we haven’t discovered in the solar system?

In the last few weeks, I read a few news that presented new advances in our understanding of the solar system, which implied we don’t really know our neighboorhood that well. I was wondering, how likely is it that we make a significant discovery around us in the next decade? Like discovering a new massive object (moon or even planet etc.), or that a planet area is habitable 
I was assuming it’s very unlikely because we have good measures and models (gravity based or other means I guess) but those few papers (sorry I didn’t bookmark them) have me wonder. How much do we really know of our nearest environment, before looking at interstellar stuff?
