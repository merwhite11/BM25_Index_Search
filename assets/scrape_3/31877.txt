How to calculate solar coordinates. (Right Ascension, Declination, and ultimately the Altitude and Azimuth of the Sun)

As the title says I am trying to calculate solar coordinates of the sun for a given location and time. I have spent many 10's of hours on this without success so I will sincerely appreciate help on this.  My RA value seems to be right on but the Dec, Alt and Az are off. 
Alt value is within 6 degrees but I cannot figure out why it is that close because the latitude is in radians instead of degrees like the other values. If I change latitude to degrees the values don't even make sense.
I have included all the values of the intermediate variables to help see at a glance what might be off. I hard coded the JD and the Local Hour Angle just to take those out of the equation for debugging.  Links are shown as to where I got those values. 
The C# code is below although the programming language doesn't matter. The formulas are the same in any language.
  //for formulas
            double D = 2458599.125000 - 2451545.0; //the  first  term is the jd of interest; 2nd term is jd of 1-1-2000 at 12:00:00.0
            double Latitude = 41.369341;
            double Longitude = 81.885493;

            double gTmp = 357.529 + 0.98560028 * D;  //mean anomaly of the sun  = 7310.0765751550007
            double gTmp1 = (gTmp % 360);     //subtract multiples of 360 (returns remainder in degrees)  =  110.07657515500068
            double g = gTmp1 * Math.PI / 180;   //Convert to radians = 1.9211986657737494
            double qTmp = 280.459 + 0.98564736 * D; //mean longitude of the sun = 7233.33868336
            double qTmp1 = (qTmp % 360); //subtract multiples of 360 (returns remainder in degrees) =  33.338683359999777
            double q = qTmp1;   //don't convert to radians here; convert after terms in degrees are added in the computation of L; =33.338683359999777
            double L_tmp = q + 1.915 * Math.Sin(g) + 0.020 * Math.Sin(2 * g);//geocentric apparent ecliptic longitude of the sun(adjusted for aberration) = 35.124421105295383
            var L = (L_tmp % 360) * Math.PI / 180;   //Convert to radians; //subtract multiples of 360 = 0.61303679614439033
            double eTmp = 23.4393 - 0.00000036 * D;  // = 23.436760515
            double e = eTmp * Math.PI / 180;   //Convert to radians;   = 0.40904863698815186
