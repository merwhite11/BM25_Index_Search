At what rate is the observable universe expanding?

The observable universe is $4.4 \times 10^{26} m $ in every direction. I told this to my daughter and then added, "And guess what? It's a little bigger today than it was yesterday."
"Wow!"
But by how much? My first thought would be: one light-day, in each direction. But that can't be right. The boundary is receding faster than the speed of light.
Yesterday, a lonely photon ended its 13.8-billion-year journey with the collapse of its wave function (or whatever, let's not start on this) on a rock orbiting a smallish star toward the edge of a spiral galaxy in a relatively sparse region of the Universe.
Today, yet another photon met a similar fate.
How much further away was the 2nd photon when it began its trek?
