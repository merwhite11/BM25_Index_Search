Can someone please tell me what the very bright star is that I see throughout the evening in the northern sky?

I'm located in NYC. I know it's not a planet, although it is very spherical and looks like one. Perhaps it's a satellite, because it doesn't move much and I don't recall ever seeing a star that appears so round.
