Aligning of 7 unidentified objects in the sky, what are they? What did I see?

So this morning (4th December 2019, 0518hrs) I was out turning my horses out in the fields and noticed a strange arrangement of what I perceive to be stars, only I’ve never seen it before and wondered if someone might be able to explain or put forward some suggestions? 
East North East in the sky there seemed to be 9 vertically aligned stars and 2 horizontally aligned stars with the lower second to last star - making an alternative shaped cross. On looking closer I realised they were moving (so definitely not stars then), altogether at first (downwards in the sky) but then as I carried on with what I was doing while watching as best I could, they’d skew a little in alignment then move back - within 10 mins I’d lost nearly all of them and could only see 2. 
Anybody have any idea what these may be? They were white in colour to the naked eye, as bright as the surrounding stars except for one just to the right hand corner of the top ‘object’ (which was slightly brighter) and we’re moving quickly enough for me to notice but not enough to stop me immediately questioning my eyes.
