Local Sidereal Time

I am trying to understand how to calculate local sidereal time and have found the following formula:
$$\text{LST} = 100.46 + 0.985647 \cdot d + \text{long} + 15 \cdot \text{UT}$$
Here, $d$ is the number of days from J2000, including the fraction of a day
UT is the universal time in decimal hours
long is your longitude in decimal degrees, East positive.
They don't explain what the two constants are (100.46 and 0.985647), could anyone please explain what those constants are and how they were calculated in the first place?
