Is Mars brightest from Earth at opposition, perihelion or somewhere in between?

After reading this article, I was inspired to run some simulations at NASA's JPL Solar System Simulator to see Earth's and Mars' orbits from above.
From what I could visually determine (from the JPEG images), Mars is at opposition on July 26, but its perihelion is sometime around September.
When (and where in their orbits) is Mars brightest from Earth this year?
