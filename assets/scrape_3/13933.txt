Would humans hear gravity waves from a binary BH fusion nearby?

The frequency of the gravity waves detected by aLIGO recently were in the audible sound spectra. Actually spanning over half of the keys of a piano, I've been told, during 2/10 or so seconds.
Would a human ear sense a gravity wave if powerful enough? The waves going through empty space from the event horizons, through the walls of a spacecraft and through the ears of astronauts. Would one actually hear a "zip" sound because space makes waves inside our ears?
