what would a captured planet do if it was in a retrograde orbit?

If our solar system some how captured a rogue planet, and it orbited the sun in the opposite direction to all the other planets,
what major affect would it have on the stability, would its drag cause all the other planets to slow down ?
could it be possible for it to be sustained at all ?
