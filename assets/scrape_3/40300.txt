Would we detect a spacecraft before it landed on Earth?

We have satellites and telescopes looking outward and inward to the earth. Would any of these detect an extraterrestrial spacecraft before it landed, or in other words, would we know a spacecraft was approaching before it did (assuming its going at some reasonably detectable speed in our local area)?
Let's assume it is Saturn V like wrt detectability.
