Telescope question

During the daylight, you hold a ruler in a distance of 60 cm away from your eyes, and you find
the size of the Moon to be 0.55 cm (try it yourself!). At night, you use a telescope to observe rock
formations and craters on the Moon to estimate the diameter of the Moon to be about 3500 km.
Find the distance to the Moon by using only the information from this experiment
