How to align equatorial mount in the Southern Hemisphere?

I'm new to astronomy and recently got myself a telescope with an equatorial mount. I've found lots of resources online showing how to align the telescope but they all operate on the assumption that you live in the Northern Hemisphere and align to True North or Polaris.
What is the procedure for those of us who live on the other half of Earth? Pointing my telescope north, I still suffer problems finding and tracking objects in the sky.
