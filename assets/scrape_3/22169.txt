Why does the path of the moon in an eclipse curve (relative to the sun)

Reviewing several simulations of the solar eclipse, it is apparent that the path of the moon relative to the sun curves. 
Using https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/usa/kansas-city?iso=20170821 for example, the moon enters at 135 degrees and leaves at 217 degrees direction - that is almost a 90 degree right turn.
Why is the path curved not straight?
