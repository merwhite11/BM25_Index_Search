Is there still a red shift when moving perpendicular to the direction of incidence?

This answer suggests that when there is zero radial velocity... there will be no Doppler shift but it's not likely to be intended as precise and absolute.
I remember reading about something like this in a post here but I can't find it. While to first order there is no frequency shift when moving perpendicular (we wouldn't expect there to be be due to symmetry i.e. which way? Up or down?) I think there is a second order effect which is a Doppler shift associated with the small change in angle due to astronomical aberration.  
Question: Is this a thing? If so, what would be an expression for the frequency shift and what is it called? If the magnitude of each effect is $|v/c|$ is it always a red shift and simply
$$\Delta f/f = -\frac{v^2}{c^2}?$$
