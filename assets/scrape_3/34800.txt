Simulation and its necessity in astronomical research

I was wondering if mainly everything in Astronomical and Astrophysical was dependent on Simulations then what are the educational requirements are necessary to qualify as the Simulation Expert. 
What softwares are needed globally? Are all simulations run on a Supercomputer? Do astrophysicist require coding experience? And, is Knowledge of Programming a must?
