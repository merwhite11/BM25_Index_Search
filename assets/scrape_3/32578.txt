Can you create a black hole using kinetic energy?

Imagine you have a particle accelerator that you can crank up to arbitrarily high energies.  Because of General Relativity, the particles get heavier and heavier as you dump more energy into them.  Will these particles ever become a black hole from this relativistic mass?  If so, what will an observer particle moving parallel to the black hole, just below that speed, see?  What I'm getting at is, kinetic energy is relative.  So therefore relativistic mass is as well.  So would these particles be black holes to some observers but not others?
