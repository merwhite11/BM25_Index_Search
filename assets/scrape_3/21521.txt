If gaseous planets have solid core, can they theoretically be considered as rocky planets?

I read that gaseous planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, have a solid core deep inside. So, I wondered whats the difference between them and rocky planets apart from the fact that they have - what can supposedly be considered, a very thick atmosphere, and that their atmospheric pressure would probably be too high.
Is there any other difference which I am missing? I mean, if we go by definition, couldn't all their gaseous content, be considered as an atmosphere?
