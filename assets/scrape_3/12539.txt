What are the best candidates for solar lensing of exoplanets, and what would the results be?

If we were able to send a probe to 550AU from the Sun, which exoplanets could be examined, to what resolution, and what form would the examination take?  It is radio telescopy only, or would it be possible to optically see what the surface of an exoplanet looked like?
