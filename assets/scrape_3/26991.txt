Secondary maximum in SNIa lightcurves for near infrared

Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) are thermonuclear supernovae that generates a lot of Nickel 56 which emits photons while disintegrating. 
How is the secondary maximum in lightcurves for reddish bands (see I, J, H, K bands in the figure below) explained ?
