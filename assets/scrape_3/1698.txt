Could black holes be creators of dark matter?

At the tremendous forces of gravity inside a black hole, can "matter" be transformed into a more  degenerate form; "dark matter" (if that truly what dark matter is)?
I know the inside of a black hole isn't fully understood, but can this be an acceptable possibility? Why?
