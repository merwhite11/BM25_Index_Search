How thick are the intergalactic filaments?

Recently, in October, news came out about the faint intergalactic filaments finally being 'found'.
Then, in June, astronomers announced that these things had enough normal matter in them to solve the 'missing baryon problem'.
Although their length(s) are often mentioned, nowhere do I hear about their width/thickness....
These 'Warm-hot intergalactic filaments' are described as long, thin filaments of plasma;  brought together by gravity....
Does anybody have an idea as to these filaments' thickness/width?
