What is the specific term for time of the night when there is no moon?

There are times when the sun goes down and it takes a while for the moon to rise, because the moon obviously doesn't rise with the sunset whole year. I guess this happens only when the moon is full. Also, in some days, moon sets in the midnight and there is no moon on the sky for the rest of the night. So, I was wondering what that time period of the night is called when the moon has gone down, or has yet to rise? Can we call it 'moondown'? I am not talking about the new moon when there is no moon the whole night. Please help, and thank you in advance!
