How the depth[Mpc] is obtained from the redshift

I read this paper.  In this paper, they show the three-dimensional distribution of the [OII] emitters. 
It is mentioned that The depth in z-axis is converted from the redshift, which is estimated from the ratio of [O II] emission lines measured with NB912 filter to that measured with NB921 filter. This is shown in this fig

I have this doubt that how to get this depth in Mpc from the redshift. They mentioned that the centre of galaxy cluster at z=1.5.
