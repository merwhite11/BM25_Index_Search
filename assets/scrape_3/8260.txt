Solar System formation, considering its and the universe's age

It is known that the Sun is 4.6 billion years old, and the complete Solar System is of a similar age. The class of stars to which the Sun belongs seems to be quite common. Stars of its class can live for 8 or 9 billion years before moving to the red giant stage. Also, the whole universe is less than 14 billion years old.
Thus, not many generations of Sun-like stars could have existed before the first stages of our Solar System. And heavy elements are created when stars collapse. While there could be a lot of star classes with much shorter lifespans, I'm wondering: where do the heavier elements came from? Not only for our Solar System, but many others. I think it is very likely that our Solar System is of average age; do the numbers match between dead stars and remote stellar systems? Are there studies about this?
