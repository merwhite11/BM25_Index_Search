Fast moving bright star with eliptic course, instant stop

Around 13 years ago I saw fast moving bright star with eliptic course which crossed half a sky in 1-2 sec and stopped instantly like it was a smashed like a bug, and didn't move for a while few minutes, then I went my way. I saw many falling stars and sattelits mouvements, planes on night, but never something similar.  Thank you in advance!
