Accuracy of Mercury transit calculations

What is the error range for calculations for the time of 1st-4th contacts for a given GPS coordinate on Earth?
I observed through a telescope the 3rd and 4th contacts and compared against SkySafari and Stellarium.  I found SkySafari showed contacts about 10 seconds earlier for the same location vs Stellarium.  Stellarium was very close to my measurements for 3rd contact (1-2 seconds).  To get the calculation I zoomed the GUI and tweaked the time until it was closest to the contact.  Estimates for 4th contact (transit end) are much harder to visually time.
This got me interested to know if there is a gold standard for such calculations, and what is the range of error for it.   For forecasts n years out is the error range n times more?
