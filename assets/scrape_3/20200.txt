How many things are wrong in this "artist view" of the TRAPPIST-1 system?

There is a this poster on the NASA site
(
that irks me. Of course its an artist's fantasy, but since it is on a NASA site, I see people considering it as scientifically accurate. So, beyond the two obvious "In which direction(s) is the sun", and "OMG these two planets are crashing into each other! Before we crash in the debris!", what else is wrong? Tides? Roche's limit? Atmospheres ripped out?
Also, since 1e is an intermediate planet, it is possible to have the other six planets all conveniently placed in the same area of the sky?
