Are there more stars than all the words ever spoken by humans?

A while ago I saw Neil deGrasse Tyson comparing the number of stars in the universe with the number of words spoken by all of humankind, ever since.
I realize both of these numbers are not strictly defined, but still, we can use our best observations together with our best guesses to find out which number is larger, and by how many magnitudes. It's a good example of making you realize the size of astronomical numbers in the true sense of the word.
What is your answer or guesstimate?
