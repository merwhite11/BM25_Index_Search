Why is Proxima Centauri called Proxima Centauri?

It seems very logical, to call the star, closest to earth, "Proxima" ("Proximus" is Latin for "close" and the word for star, "stella", is feminin, hence "Proxima"), but there's one thing I don't understand: in order to call a star Â±"The closest one", you must be sure that in future, no closer star will be found.
This is not so simple: lots of very close stars, like Barnard's star, Kapteyn's, ..., are very weak and even not visible to the naked eye.
So, how can we be that sure that Proxima is indeed the nearest one? Have astronomers indeed examined the complete sky in order to prove this?
