Stars located outside of a galaxy

How common or rare is it to find stars outside of a galaxy? Can such a star still have planets that contain life? Recently, I think that I heard of a star with a planet that entered our Galaxy. Did this star come here from another galaxy or was it originally from the Milky Way?
