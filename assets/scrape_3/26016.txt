What are the "lines" in a constellation or asterism called?

Is there a technical term for the "lines" in a constellation or asterism? Alternatively, is there an astronomy related coloquialism or any informal term that refers specifically to these lines, and not to the constellation itself?
To illustrate: 
In the two examples below, what is the (most?) correct way to describe all of the green lines in the two images.

Argo Navis, an asterism and former constellation.

The constellation of Draco.

Further Background/Details:
I was doing some astronomy related browsing and noticed the some of the representations of the same constellation had differences between different sources. The majority were very similar, others had more significant differences. 

Version 1

Version 2

Version 3




Version 1 has significantly more lines included in it than Versions 2 and 3.
Version 1 has the line between η Cygni and β Cygni, appears to go via φ Cygni.
Version 3 has the line between η Cygni and β Cygni, goes via a star to the upper right of χ Cygni on the charts.


I want to search for more examples of the different ways the lines in the constellations have been drawn, and all my google fu has failed to produce any useful search terms. Consequently I'm hoping to find there is a term that describes the lines themselves which should be more helpful at finding  material focused on the ways these lines have been drawn.
