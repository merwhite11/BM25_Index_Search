Why haven't detected life in the universe?

It would seem that if life were relatively common in the universe that there would be a cacophony of noise somewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum. Is life so rare and distant that the waves haven't reached us yet, or have they attenuate out, or are they unintelligible, or are we the first, or are we alone?
