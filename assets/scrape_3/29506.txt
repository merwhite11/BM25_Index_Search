How does one "use" the Pan-Starrs data?

I've seen that a large block of Pan-Starrs data has been released and is available on-line and how the distributors of the data expect professionals and the general public to use the data in their research. I am part of the general public and was wondering how accessible the data actually is?  For instance if i were interested in searching a small section of sky for a moving object, i would need multiple "photos" "data sets"? over time in order to see the movement.  Would special software be required? How would one even start the process?
