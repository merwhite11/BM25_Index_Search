What phenomenon causes "lunar waves"?

In multiple video clips of the moon but also one of Jupiter, some kind of waves can be observed. Is this just the effect of the object moving behind layers of different refractive indexes (similar to what we observe at sunset) or is there a wave propagating through the atmosphere?

There is an answer on Quora, but I would love to see a more detailed answer, why we can see exactly these two rather sharp lines moving.
