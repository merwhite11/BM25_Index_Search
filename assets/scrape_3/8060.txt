How is the maximum density in a circumstellar disk determined?

I'm working with some equations to model the evolution of a circumstellar disk. One of the equations is
$$\rho(r)=Ce^{-\frac{(r-r_{peak})^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}$$
where $\rho$ is density, $r$ is the distance from the center, $C$ is a constant, $\sigma$ is one standard deviation, and $r_{peak}$ is the radius at which the density is at a maximum.
If the function was of the form
$$\rho(r)=Ce^{f(r)}$$
where $f(r)$ is a function of $r$, I could find the maximum easily by finding
$$\rho'(r)=Cf'(r)e^{f(r)}=0$$
and solving for $r$. However, this appears to be impossible in the current case because $\rho(r)_{peak}$ is already in the equation, at $r_{peak}$.
How is $r_{peak}$ determined in a given scenario? Is it determined experimentally?
