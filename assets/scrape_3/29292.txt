Do Mercury and Venus exhibit retrograde motion?

This is more a terminology question, since Mercury and Venus certainly "move backwards" in the sky. The question is whether we call this retrograde motion. I'm referring to apparent retrograde motion here, not retrograde rotation.
I'm under the impression we don't, and reserve that name only for planets that are further away from the Sun than us; however conclusive evidence for whether this is (or isn't) the widely-accepted meaning for "retrograde motion" is hard to find.
