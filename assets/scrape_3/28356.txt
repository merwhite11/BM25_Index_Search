Explanation of Longitude of Periapsis

I'm looking for a mathematical justification of the longitude of periapsis as it makes no mathematical sense to me as a notion. By definition, it is the sum of the argument of periapsis and the longitude of the ascending node, each of which makes sense on their own.  I understand these latter two notions geometrically. But I don't know what the longitude of periapsis is supposed to represent.  The longitude of the ascending node is an actual angle measured within the ecliptic, while the argument of periapsis is an actual angle measured within the given bodies orbital plane.  These two planes are skewed with respect to one another by an inclination angle.  Thus, you cannot mathematically just add the two angles together; it geometrically has no representation.  At least not without making certain unmentioned assumptions which cannot possibly be true for all bodies.  I cannot make sense of why it seems to be the preferred orbital parameter.
This question is not a duplicate of What is exactly the "longitude of the perigee". The two-sentence afterthought regarding this topic therein doesn't adequately respond to the spirit of my question. I'm looking for a mathematical justification for its use, including why its regarded as more accurate than splitting up the angles into their separate components.
