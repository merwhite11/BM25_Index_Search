Does light from the sun reach the surface of Venus

I am aware we have images from the surface of Venus from the Venera missions but I am not sure if those images are taken using the visible spectrum the human eye can see. This is why I was wondering if light reaches the surface of Venus with how dense the atmosphere is or would it be pitch black?
