Was the whole Universe close to Big Bang very small, or just very dense?

I am sorry this question is probably silly for professional astronomers, of which I am not one.
I often hear at lectures that immediately after the Big Bang, the universe was small, say, the size of grapefruit or something like that. But because of inflation which stretched space at super-light (but finite), speed, the observable universe now, may not be the whole universe, and the whole universe may be infinite. If it is infinite, then it would seem that it had to be infinite in infancy as well, just very dense. In fact, it seems "in the limit", it had to be infinite even at Big Bang.  
So, questions:
Was early universe small, or only dense but still infinite?
How about at Big Bang, was it infinite?
When astronomers say early universe was small, do they simply mean "the part of the universe which corresponds to our observable universe, was small"?
