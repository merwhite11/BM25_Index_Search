Is it relevant to ask the limits of space?

Yesterday I watched "The Orville" episode 4 and there was interesting moment where a kid and old man saw the space for the first time.

Kid: What is this?
Capitan: Kid, that is space.
Old man: I used to imagine how it would be. It was nothing like this.
  How far does it extend?
Kelly: No one knows. Probably to infinity.

In real life we also occasionally ask ourselves if space is finite. And I think it's not a relevant question. We tend to adjust everything to Earth standars where everything is limited and finite. It's very hard for us to accept that something can be infinite, that we even think universe is inside of something and has a material "shell" or a wall. But even if there was wall it should be infinite. So in reality our "wall" is probably empty space or hard vacuum or infinite universes that we will never see because they are infinitely far away, well maybe most of them. 
So it's that simple to accept that space is infinite, that we should not even ask that question, since it's so irrelevant and space can only be infinite.
Sorry for my english and the question, since you probably know this and much more, I just wanted to write something.
