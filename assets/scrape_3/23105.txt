How can the universe be expanding faster than speed of light?

So the story goes like this:
A long time ago, 13.799Â±0.021 billion years to be exact, something happened. It was a big bang, loud explosion and universe came to existence. It grew and grew, and now we know that the observable universe is about 93 billion light years in diameter. So it means that

objects that were once close ... are now up to around 45.7 billion
  light years away rather than up to 13.799 billion light years away ...

Hence my question is that everything is traveling faster than the speed of light?
If it is, then what does it mean in terms of special relativity?

I did read:

Is the universe expanding faster than speed of light?
How fast is the universe expanding?
