Is communication with proxima b possible with todays technology?

Let's say we have already a base on an exoplanet (like Proxima B). Would it be possible to send information from that base to the earth with todays technology? Not to talk about communication with such a distance ...
And how would it be done? Light or Radiowaves? Would it be possible to direct it so well, that some very small fraction of that wave could reach the earth? Or is it only a question of how much energy is needed?
