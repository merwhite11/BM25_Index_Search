Change in axis of the Earth if the Moon would dissappear

I read that, if the moon would not be there or if it would dissapear or be destroyed it could cause the earth to rotate into a possible axis of 45° degrees. Because it would be missing the gravitational forces of the moon that keeps te earth in the current axis of +-23.5°. If that happend a part of the earth, for example Europe, could turn in a way that it would be permanently "night".
If I understood that correctly and it is possible, would that transformation take long? Or would it be fast? And with fast I am talking about a couple of years or decades and long about thousands or millions of years.
I am working on a story that would involve this and I am trying to see if I can get the logic to work with a real scientific explanation.
