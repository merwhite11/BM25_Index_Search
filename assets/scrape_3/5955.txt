What is this graph showing?


This is from the NED
What do these three titles mean?

log fb (Jy)
MRK 1014
Log v (HZ)

Why is there LINE,LINE,LINE,LINE,LINE written along the bottom? What does that signify?
What are the dots and lines showing? A range of information? In that chase, what's the relevance of the dot? 
Is it like this: The dot is the log v and then the horizontal line shows the range of MRK 1014 recorded for that log v and the vertical line showing the log fv recorded for it?
Why does the log v between 12 - 16.3 have small amounts of log fv and MRK 1014, but the log v between 15 - 19 have no log fv at all, but a large amount of MRK 1014. The same goes for the 2 log v points between 10.4 - 12, except these two have a large amount of log fv but no MRK 1014
Maybe if you could explain the units to me and give me links to further reading it would all become a lot clearer...
Update Okay MRK 1014 is the same of the object. (Doh!) However, what is that titless axis showing?
