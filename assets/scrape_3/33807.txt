Will it be dangerous when close stars become Red Giants?

What will happen if close stars like Sirius A or Procyon_A become red giants? Is it dangerous for the Earth and life on it?
If for Sirius A we still have 500-800 million years, but Procyon A might become a red giant in 10 to 100 million years, by astronomical scale it is very soon.
Or nothing will happen with the Earth, because it is still too far?
