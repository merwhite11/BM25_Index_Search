Would planet explode without gravity?

A planet (as well as a dwarf planet) must, according to the IAU definition, have sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape). Does it mean they would break apart or explode if gravity vanishes, unlike small bodies like comets or minor planets, whose integrity doesn't depend on gravity?
