A strange star-like object

So it was around 6 AM and i was looking at the sky and there were not many visible stars because the sun was about to rise. There were two stars that were brighter than the others and i was looking at them for about 5 mins. They weren't moving and the space between them seemed very little. Suddenly, one of those stars started moving down in direction towards the horizon and the other remained still. The star continued to go down. In 1 or 2 minutes it went behind the horizon and stopped being visible, while the other was still at the same place like earlier. At first I thought that the moving object was a satellite, but then i realised that a satellite would orbit the earth with constant speed, and the object i saw remained still for atleast 5 mins. So what else can it be???
