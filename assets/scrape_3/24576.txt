Theoretical sudden appearance of a black hole in BBC drama show *spoiler warning*

I asked this on the ‘movies’ stackexchange site but they suggested I ask here, it’s a purely hypothetical query based on a BBC drama show called ‘Hard Sun’, feel free to kill the question if it’s inappropriate here.
In the TV show’s series finale an expected ‘extinction level event’ happens and appears to be a black hole close to our sun, it already has developed a spiral of hot gas around it drawn from the sun.
Clearly this is fiction but I’m keen to understand just how badly-considered this is. Firstly the show is set in London and everyone seems amazed when the image below rises from the dusk yet clearly it's been in existence for the time taken to create the spiral (hours at least?) so nations east of the UK would have seen it for that time and reported on it globally surely?
My real question is more around is there any potential scenario where a black hole of that size could develop suddenly and get to that size quickly enough for that image to be a surprise? My understanding, very much as a scientific-layman, is that a black hole of that size would have to have the mass of at least one of our suns to get to that size (probably more) - is that a valid assumption? If so where has the mass come from? Also wouldn't the sudden existence of something else with at least the same mass as our sun suddenly appearing at the centre of our solar system have enormous gravitational impact on everything in the system, including Earth? We'd have massive volcanic/tectonic impact wouldn't we?
So again sorry if this is inappropriate, I was just incredulous at how badly-considered the scientific aspects of this fiction were and wanted to check that my understandings were correct.
