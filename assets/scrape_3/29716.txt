How to separate binary and optical stellar pairs?

I have list of stellar pairs from The Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS), i.e. I have next parameters:

angular separations
position angles
stellar magnitudes of both components

Additionally I have GAIA DR2 parallaxes (and other parameters) from SIMBAD database. How to distinguish between binary and optical stellar pairs?
