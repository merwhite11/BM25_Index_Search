How is the heat production inside moons compliant with Conservation of Energy?

A Nova episode said that during stages of some moons' elliptical orbits, the moon is stretched, and friction causes the inside of the moon to heat up. I do not understand how this is compliant with the Law of Conservation of Energy - what energy would be lost to make the inside of the moon heat up?
