Finding Latitude and Longitude of a person or of where a picture was taken

this is my first post on the Astronomy stack exchange site. Please let me know how this question is based on y'all's generally accepted criteria for a good question as well as possible improvements.
In my AP comp sci class we were given pretty much total freedom to come up with a project, I remembered hearing about it being possible to calculate a person's position or the position a picture was taken based on time of day and the position of the Sun, that is, longitudinal and latitudinal position. For the picture, I heard Sun position was determined through some implementation of shadows in the picture. I thought this was cool and decided to look into it. I found an article written by a prominent UCLA physicist and a well-researched Wikipedia page. I understand what the Wikipedia page requires in regards to values for calculations and what the equations calculate, but I do not understand how to implement them to find longitudinal and latitudinal location, nor do I understand why it has rectangular equatorial coordinates as that is not included in the three-step explanation in the Wikipedia page intro at the top.
For the UCLA report, I understand none of it except for the matrix mathematics and manipulations, and I'm sketchy on those at best, but I do not understand all the coordinate systems that it mentions nor how to implement them to achieve my objective.
So my question comes down to this: Can anyone clarify the equations, their purpose, their implementation, how to convert an answer to longitude and latitude for either the Wikipedia page or the UCLA report?
OR
If you can explain how to find the latitude and longitude of a picture or person. If you choose to explain, I do need equations or an explanation that I can turn into equations.
Please suggest question revisions and whether this should be posted on a different Stackexchange forum. Thanks.
