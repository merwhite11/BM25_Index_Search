L4&L5 positions?

I know that, in L4&L5, the distances to the two main bodies should be equal. Still, how can I calculate that distance with accuracy? How can I know that that distance is inside the equipotential surface?
Let's take, as an example, the Sun-Earth system and the Earth-Moon system.
Thank you in advance!
