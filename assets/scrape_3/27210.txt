First Telescope SkyWatcher Heritage 5" Tabletop Dobsonian Telescope

I have been star gazing for awhile with a pair of binoculars and now I am ready to step it up a bit and purchase a telescope.
I have been looking at the SkyWatcher Heritage 5" Tabletop Dobsonian Telescope.
Would this be a suitable first telescope , I hope to be able to make out the rings of Saturn using stock the Eyepiece.
Or would this be considered overkill and something like the Celestron 21035 70mm Travel Scope be more suitable.ï»¿
