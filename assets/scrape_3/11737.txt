If I were to point into the sky, how many galaxies would be in this line?

If I point in the sky and draw a line from the tip of my finger to the end of the universe, how many galaxies would this line cross? I had a discussion with my dad and he said due to the universe being so empty the line wouldn't cross any solid matter. I said that the universe is so enormous in size that there would be many galaxies and stars crossing the line.
Is this calculable? If yes which one is correct?
