dull rock/potato-shaped object seen with naked eye, moving in straight line during night. What could it be and is size and speed estimation possible?

Between years 2009-2011, I was located in Greece, watching the perfectly dark night sky around 21:00-23:00 during summer, when I suddenly noticed a very dull dark-brown object that looked like a solid rock/potato having a perceived size around half the diameter of the moon in the sky, moving in a perfect straight line looking up 
 and perceived as fast (it took 3-4 seconds to disappear in the horizon) - so total exposure if I had seen it from start to end would have been less than 10-12 seconds.
One could barely notice it, it had some texture like a rock but blurry. It had almost no light reflection and it wasn't rotating or anything. It wasn't spherical and it was somewhat elongated along the axis of movement. I was barely able to detect it above me with naked eyes, as it was passing from left to right. I only did when I saw it was hiding a small region of the night sky stars. This way I perceived its irregular shape.
Unfortunately I cannot tell it's actual size or how fast it was going. Is it an object of a kind known to astronomers? I couldn't find any similar video footage or anyone seeing something similar talking in the internet. Could it be a space rock (asteroid?) that missed the earth atmosphere and at the same time be seen with naked eyes? Any estimates on space rock type, size and speed based on the time of sky exposure? Any astronomical id from a database or some guidance on how I could search it? 
Could it be an asteroid occultation like this one: http://call4obs.iota-es.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/palma_south.gif
