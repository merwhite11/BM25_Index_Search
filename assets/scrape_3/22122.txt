Which focus point does the sun occupy for each planet?

I am aware that planets orbit in an elliptical fashion and that the sun occupies one of two focal points. 
Let us say that the left focal point is f1 and the right f2.
Is the sun at the same focal point for each planet?
If not which ones are different?
