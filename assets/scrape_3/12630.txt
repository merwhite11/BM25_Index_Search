Does Dark Matter affect the motion of the Solar System?

Would dark matter have a similar effect on the Solar System as it does on the Milky Way? I'd imagine it could help hold together some of the Solar System bodies or at least affect their motion, right? Maybe to a lesser extent, but would it be significant?
