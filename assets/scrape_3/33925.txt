Could S5-HVS1 conceivably still hold on to any planets?

If the star (S5-HVS1) has been accelerated to 1,700 km/s by a close encounter with the super massive black hole at the centre of our galaxy (Sagittarius A*) what would happen to any planets orbiting this star? Would they have been stripped off by the massive acceleration or could any conceivably still be in orbit? Presumably any orbiting bodies would be significantly perturbed!? see https://www.sciencealert.com/our-bossy-black-hole-kicked-out-a-star-and-it-s-shooting-through-the-galaxy-insanely-fast
