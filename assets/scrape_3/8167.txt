Visibility of earth from moon during day-time of moon

Inspired by this question. I am curious whether earth, besides being nearly fixed on one place on the moon's sky, is it visible during the day-time on moon too?
My understanding is that earth should be visible as moon has no atmosphere. Also, if the NASA didn't edit the following photograph, it suggests that the day-time sky of moon is all black and earth should be visible in it.

I think, Stellarium don't take into account the atmosphere once you are on other planet.
