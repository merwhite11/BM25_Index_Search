Can one calculate the size (i.e. the radius) of our universe?

If one can estimate the mass of our universe, might one also calculate its ultimate size, (after it fully expands), based on the Schwarzschild formula for the radius of a black hole? Please note that this simple formula 
$$R=\frac{2GM}{c^2}$$ 
informs us that larger black holes are less dense. So, if it turns out that our universe is in fact a gigantic black hole, then one would expect it to be extremely low-density!
