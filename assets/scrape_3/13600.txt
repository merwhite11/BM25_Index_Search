Are we so sure global warming is a result of humans burning fossil fuels?

The Sun is a fiery mass of colliding particles.  We still know very little about what it is.  Could it possibly be the output of the sun fluctuates, like our weather, from one extreme to another.  From hot durations to cold durations and back again. I think global warming is the result of higher amounts of solar energy being released from the Sun; that's why it's getting hotter here.  I believe the question is important to all people on planet Earth, par excellence; is humanity, namely our consumption of fossil fuels, the cause of our predicament?
