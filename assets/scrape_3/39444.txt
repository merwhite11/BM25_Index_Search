Does lightning on Venus affect the chemical composition of the clouds?

It is established that lightning occurs on Venus due to the presence of sulfuric acid clouds. Does this constant electric discharges and possible electrolysis affects the composition of the clouds on Venus for instance, sulfuric acid dissociating into ions like hydrogen ions, sulfate/bisulfate ions or decomposing into sulfur oxides or changing to other sulfur oxoacids?
There was a question on space.SE that discussed if peroxydisulfuric acid (H2S2O8) created due to electrolysis of concentrated sulfuric acid (from the lightning) can be used as a propellant fuel. If the species is indeed formed in the atmosphere, how abundant is it? How much of this species is present in the atmosphere?
Does lightning on Venus change/affect the chemical composition of the clouds? Does it affect the sulfur cycle of Venus in any way (so that it could create more exotic sulfur species)?
