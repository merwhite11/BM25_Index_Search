Is the magnetic field strength of a star predictable from mass, composition, age and angular momentum alone?

This answer to Which stellar properties can we describe as “first principles” in which we can derive the rest? contains an intriguing bit:

That states that composition and mass are the two key properties, assuming that the star is in hydrostatic equilibrium and derives its energy from nuclear reactions.
I agree with Rob that rotation (angular momentum) is a key second-order effect, and I'd add magnetic field strength as well.

which triggered an intriguing comment:

Is the magnetic field strength generally independent of the other three properties?

Question: Is the magnetic field strength of a star predictable from mass, composition, age and angular momentum? Or is it somewhat random or at least unpredictable from those alone for some reason?
I suppose it could be somehow inherited, influenced or acquired from its surroundings during formation, or arise from some random or chaotic process, but I have no idea.
