How to calculate when Mars was in retrograde around 129 BCE?

I am trying to make an accurate illustration of the sky from when Ptolemy was observing the planets in Greece. 
I am trying to find out when Mars was in retrograde during those years. I have read both SE questions and answer about how to calculate it mathematically but both of those are a little over my head. 
Some of the silly astrology sites have the retrograde dates listed back the 1930s, I want to know what were the dates Mars was in retrograde around 129 BC.
