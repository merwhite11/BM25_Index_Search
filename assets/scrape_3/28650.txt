Current delay for radio signals from the Mars InSight mission

I've been meaning to post it on the day when InSight landed but just got around to it now.
When they broadcasted landing in real-time, it really wasn't in real-time because radio signals from Mars can take from 3 to 24 minutes to reach the Earth (depending on the distance between Mars and Earth) if I am not mistaken.
So what was the delay on the date InSight landed? Each time someone mentioned "real-time" I cringed a little bit because everything already happened some time ago and we were just only learning about it now.
