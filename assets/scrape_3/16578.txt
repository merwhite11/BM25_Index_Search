Will Gaia detect inactive neutron stars?

Will the astrometric precision of the Gaia space telescope be able to detect the gravitational influence of cold old solitary neutron stars on the movements of stars? At least in a statistical sense to estimate how common they are around here, which could say something about how large the population III stars were.
And if an inactive neutron star could be precisely located thanks to its gravitational influence, would it be possible to observe it directly?
