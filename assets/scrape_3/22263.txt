How wary should I be of old cosmology books?

Recently I bought a couple of books on cosmology from a second-hand bookshop. One was published in 1993 and the other is from the 1970.
I know, from a recent book, that the inflaton theory is probably newer than both books and that the Higgs Boson has been discovered, but that is all that I know has changed recently in the field of cosmology. Has anything else changed since then?
Which topics of the books should I understand are considered outdated?

The two books are Modern Cosmology by Jagjit Singh (published 1961 and rereleased in 1970) and Afterglow of Creation by Marcus Chown (published in 1993)
