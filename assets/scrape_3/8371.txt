How do we get radio signals of the big bang?

From TV shows I have known that we still get some radio signals of the big bang and they are every where. My question is is the universe expanding so fast that even electromagnetic wave has failed to cross it after big bang?
Or is it possible that there is another dimension that we don't know of? Like the earth is nearly flat and in small portion it's surface can be called 2d. But it possible to go "straight" and come back at the same spot as it is in "3d space". So is it possible that the space is 4d and somehow light has crossed the cosmos several times?
