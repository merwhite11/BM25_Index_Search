Gamma ray detection for SETI. How far away could we detect an alien nuclear powered rocket?

I suspect our best bet for finding advanced civilisations is to look for gamma rays characteristic of nuclear/antimatter propulsion.
If an alien civilisation was using something similar to the Orion drive, how close would they have to be for us to be able to detect the gamma rays?  
In my mind, this question has two parts:
What are the magnitude/frequency limits on the gamma ray telescopes in orbit? (Specifically Fermi, assuming that has the best detection capabilities of an orbital gamma ray observatory)
What's the magnitude and frequency profile on, say, a 1 megaton nuclear bomb? 
I've had a bit of trouble finding these out myself from a casual search, and am wondering if maybe there are military secret issues surrounding the detection of gamma rays.
