Question about the relevant physical parameters to build a backyard observatory

I live in a big city: SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I would like to build a simple telescope dome to do some amateur sky obseravtions. But the whole project lies on the viability to see something interresting more than just some stars. Due to high luminosity of cities this is a good question to ask.
So, which physical parameters are relevant to decide if a backyard observatory is a good holiday DIY project?
