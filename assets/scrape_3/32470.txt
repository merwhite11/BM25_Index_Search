Aphelion and the solstice

We have just passed one of the solstices and are approaching aphelion.  The two events are close but not simultaneous.  There is no very obvious (to me) reason why the two should coincide or be close.  Is there a less obvious reason why they are close?  If so, is the gap closing, growing, or remaining approximately constant?
