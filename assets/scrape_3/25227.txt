Do today's professional astronomers use earth rotation angle or sidereal time?

I have read that "earth rotation angle" is the modern replacement for "Greenwich sidereal time". Is it actually the case that modern professional astronomers are using earth rotation angle? Either way, what is the reason for using the one they use?
