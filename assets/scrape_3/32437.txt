What causes these asteroid trails to be so strangely shaped and repeated?

The Phys.org news item Hubble is the ultimate multitasker: Discovering asteroids while it's doing other observations includes the image below.
What causes these asteroid trails to be so strangely shaped and repeated? Usually asteroids appear as short straight segments in long exposures from terrestrial telescopes.


Some asteroids from within our Solar System have photobombed deep images of the Universe taken by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. The asteroidal streaks in this image are created by our virtual neighbours; asteroids in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. In the background are thousands of colourful galaxies, some of them billions of light years away. Credit: NASA, ESA, and B. Sunnquist and J. Mack (STScI); CC BY 4.0; Acknowledgment: NASA, ESA, and J.
