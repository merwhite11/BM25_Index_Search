Dobsonian telescopes: do collapsible scopes have any drawbacks?

When choosing between a collapsible and a non collapsible 12‚Äù dobsonian scope what drawbacks if any do collapsible dobsonian scopes have?
If I transport any scope it will need collimating. Obviously a collapsible scope will store better.
