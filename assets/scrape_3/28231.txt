Would you get the same planet-discovering data for our own system at the same distance we're getting from Earth?

So there's a boatload of planets being discovered around stars in our solar neighborhood.
Kepler 22, 638 ly away, was discovered to have a planet Kepler 22b, calculated to be twice the size of Earth.
The observations that make these measurements aren't high resolution images but periodic changes in luminosity (the transit method).
My question is: would a similar situation with similar telescope properties (Kepler) detect our own Earth around our Sun from a similar distance? If not, then how close would you have to be to see Earth?
Presumably there is some correspondence among: distance, luminosity/size of a star, size of a planet. Any other factors that make Kepler-22 different from us?
Note: this question asks about Alpha Centauri. I'm asking specifically about distances like Kepler-22.
