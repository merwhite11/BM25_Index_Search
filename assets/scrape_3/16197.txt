Higgs Bosons in the centre of Black holes or extremely large stars

With the discovery of the Higgs Boson as the mass carrier, what is the possibility at the centre of a black hole being so dense and gravity so infinite that the structure of a proton or neutron are ripped apart into their fundamental elements by these extreme energies that Higgs Bosons are massed together at the centre, while the remaining massless subatomic particles are just outside this layer, similar to an onion  (Similar to a star as more elements fuse together they become more dense, and gravity forces them to the centre again like an onion)
