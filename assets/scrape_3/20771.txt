How do tadpole, horseshoe co-orbital states arise and how are they stable?

A recent paper in Nature "Planetary science: Reckless orbiting in the Solar System" (Morais & Namouni, 2017) presents the following series of four co-orbital states:

While I understand the development of the quasi-satellite and trisectrix states, I am unable to inuit the development of the tadpole and horseshoe co-orbital states.
From explanation provided in the article:

The tadpole and horseshoe shapes arise because the planet's
gravitational attraction alters the body's orbital path — the body
goes through a cycle of catching up with the planet and falling
behind, seeming to change direction from the perspective of the
planet.

How, when approaching the planet, does the body "fall behind" instead of continuing to accelerate toward the planet?
The only means that comes to mind is if the planet orbits faster than the body, but then I imagine it would

No longer be considered co-orbital (because it would have a different orbital period), and
Would eventually be overtaken by the planet.

How, then, do these first two co-orbital states work?
