Quasar mass and accretion rates

This page on Wikipedia -- Quasars mentions that the "The largest known [quasar] is estimated to consume matter equivalent to 600 Earths per minute". However, there is no citation for this comment. How can I find out where this information came from? I've commented in the Talk section for the page.
