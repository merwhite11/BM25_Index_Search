Pluto is fuzed to all the asteroids, comets, other minor planets, etc. Would it be big enough to hold an atmosphere without forming a tail?

All minor planets, asteroids, comets, etc that aren't orbiting bigger planets are included.
Anything bigger than a minor planet, or any object orbiting something that exceeds minor planet size, isn't included in the fusion.
So our moon, for example, because it's orbiting Earth and Earth is too big to be included, would be exempt from the fusion and wouldn't have its mass and matter added to Pluto's.
Pluto keeps its orbit, after the fusion it just gets bigger with the comets asteroids and other minor planets made one with it. Anything that would stay frozen on Pluto's surface before will still be frozen, anything would melt or boil on Pluto's surface would still melt or boil, etc. There's just more stuff there. Nu Pluto is still just as cold post-fuze as it was before. it's just a much much bigger lump of still-cold rock.
