Will we be able to see our galaxy if we travel far enough?

Will we be able to see our galaxy if we travel far enough? When we leave earth far enough, we'll be able to see Earth from distant, is it same with the galaxy? if we travel far enough, will we see the shape of our galaxy with naked eye?
Do we have to travel really far to see our galaxy like a dot? or just far enough to realize the size and shape of our galaxy?
