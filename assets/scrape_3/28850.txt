When astronomers "look into the past" are they accounting for the expansion of space?

Every time astronomers look "13 billion" years into the past, not only is there more space than there normally would be at that instant which increases from observation to observation, but there was also expanding space for eons prior to that which must offset photons over those billions of years. 
I haven't seen astronomers ever actually state they've reconciled that difference whenever they talk about their observations, so 
1: Do they actually?
2: How do they?
3: How does that change the reality of their public statements?
