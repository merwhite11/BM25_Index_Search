How to choose portable, yet powerful telescope

Due to the nature of my job, I have to spend log periods of time (4 - 6 months each), at different countries across Europe, Middle East and Far East. I have a 12 Inch Dobsonian at home, but I rarely spend 1 month a year, at home. Travelling with the Dob is out of question due to its weight and I don't always have access to low lying windows or a rooftop when abroad, making a dob pretty useless. I really want to have at one, at least 8", portable option while I'm travelling. Celestron NexStar 8 SE is looking good to me at the moment. It seems to have half the weight of an 8" scope with equatorial mount and from what I've heard, it can be used table-top, without tripod. I can also carry the OTA in hand luggage, to avoid damage to optical components. Can someone confirm if

(i) Does 8SE work on tabletop without tripod?
(ii) How durable is the mount? Can it survive transportation in checked baggage, if placed in its original packaging?
(iii) Any other suggestions for a scope that is at or above 8" and can be carried around easily when travelling internationally?
