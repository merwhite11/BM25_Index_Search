Unknown moving light in sky

On July 13, 2018, while camping in Southwest Oregon, a bright light appeared in the sky at sunset. It was much brighter than Jupiter, also visible. It was moving slowly, west to east. I estimate it took 1/2 hour to cross the sky, though I didn't watch it all the way. The brightness seemed to vary, as did the coloration. It seemed it was reflecting the sunlight. It was higher than the clouds.
   I had a spotting scope with me and it was not a point nor a disc, but rather circular, bright around the edge with a less-bright center. It kind of looked like a planetary nebula, only quite bright. I thought maybe it was a weather balloon, but I really have no idea.
