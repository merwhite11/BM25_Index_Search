Why aren't planetary bodies static?

Why are planets moving in the first place? Gravity causes them to orbit, but why move at all? 
note: this is not a question on why planets orbit each other, I know the reason for that is gravity. What I'm asking is why do planets move at all? For example, if you turned off gravity, why would the planets carry on moving apart rather than be stationary?
