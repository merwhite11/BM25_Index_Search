How could we search for old cold neutron stars?

This is the inverse of Will Gaia detect inactive neutron stars? (to which the answer was "probably not").
So if Gaia can't do it, what would it take? How could such a search work, and what technological advances would be needed to have a reasonable chance of it working?
