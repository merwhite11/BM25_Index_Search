Is there a name for the maximum in local solar elevation angle?

It came up in conversation today that we were nearly at 21st June, and the days would shortly be getting, um, shorter.
We were trying to think of the the term that means "When the sun is at the highest point it can attain in the sky during the year", as opposed to during the day, (which is the solar noon). We have terms like Perigee and Apogee, it seems (to me) that there should be a name for this as well.
Is there?
