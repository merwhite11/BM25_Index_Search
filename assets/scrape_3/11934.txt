Can we draw a min(distance) and max(mass) relation based on current observation data of nearby astronomical objects within several parcsecs?

The data precision now can exclude a >>$1M_{\odot}$ black hole companion, which has a, say 10000 year orbital period with our sun?
Can we draw a two dimensional diagram(Mass VS. distance) to show the region that is still a grey area? Within 1 pc, there is no stellar mass black hole? If there is one, the orbit change of objects in solar system may be detectable.
How to calculate its proper motion or its planets' proper motion?
I am serious to ask. Please give some reference/technical method to calculate PM. For example, is there some reference paper about the distance limitation of the black hole based on the motion of asteroids/comets?
