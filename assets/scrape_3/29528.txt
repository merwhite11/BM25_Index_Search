Is this a Black Hole?

While researching about galaxies in Google sky, I came upon a strange area.
Co-ordinates: 11h 6m 15.0 seconds | -77° 22' 9.8"
A lot of space around this body is empty, is it possible that the body is a black hole?
The reason I'm asking is because of this image - 
This is a photograph and readings are of a real black hole..
It looks like the one on the co-ordinates which I observed with all the dust around it.
The co-ordinates of the real black hole are - 03h 19m 47.60s | +41° 30' 37.00"
