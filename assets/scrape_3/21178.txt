Should we expect clues from a gamma ray burst causing massive extinctions on Earth?

I remember reading an article on the subject highlighting the periodicity of this event throughout history supposing it could be caused by the rotation of the sun around the galaxy.
My question is: Do we have any clues that can confirm this hypothesis? What should we expect to see? Shouldn't it leave any remains?
