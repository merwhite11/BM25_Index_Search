Creating a rectangular star map

I'm trying to find/create a star map between the declinations of -45 to +60, and need it to be a rectangle. Is there any software/website that would let me create this? Is there a name for this kind of map/projection?
(I've attached a diagram to try and make myself clearer) 

Thanks for any help :)
