Is carbon dioxide gas giants possible?

Is it possible that a planet originally full of water, and the solar winds decompose the water and hydrogen escapes out, then the oxygen combines with carbon at crust, just like Venus but the whole planets are mostly carbon dioxide and hence become a gas giant?
