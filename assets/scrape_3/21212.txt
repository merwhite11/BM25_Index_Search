My homemade telescope

My telescope is blurry and I am not sure why I used a 254mm primary mirror f/5 with a secondary mirror at 62.5 and I also used a 32mm eye piece I know if I stand back 20cm from eyepiece I see a clear image but any closer and it gets blurry can someone tell me what I am missing
