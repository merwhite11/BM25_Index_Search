Could the Philae comet lander be recharged by laser?

Could the Philae comet lander be recharged with a laser (or possibly many lasers) from earth?  My thought would be to aim one or more powerful lasers from earth at the Philae lander to recharge it through its solar panels.  
Another thought would be to heat up a small part of the comet with one or more lasers, possibly causing the comet to slowly rotate into a position where the sun light falls onto the lander.  
Would either of these ideas be feasible?
