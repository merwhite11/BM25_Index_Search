Can "dark matter" be the additional mass from the speed of the Galactic Cluster?

Considering that the Earth orbits the Sun at 100 000 km/h and that the Sun orbits the Milky Way at almost 1 000 000 km/h, could it be possible that the galactic cluster orbits some super cluster at speeds approaching 1 000 000 000 km/h? 
If it did, how would that affect the mass of the cluster and how would we know or be able to measure it? 
Can you show any calculations to prove that this additional mass is not in line with what's measured for "Dark Matter"?
