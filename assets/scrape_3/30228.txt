Can Fermi Bubbles be produced in non-spiral galaxies?

In 2010 observations with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope discovered giant bubbles which have been named Fermi Bubbles. Similar structures have also been discovered by Pshirkov et al. (2016) surrounding M31 (the Andromeda Galaxy).
Our galaxy and M31 are barred spirals. Could Fermi Bubbles also form around other galaxy types, for example lenticular or elliptical galaxies?
