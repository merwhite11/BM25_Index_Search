Convert Ecliptic to Galactic Coordinates

How to convert Ecliptic co-ordinates to Galactic? The wikipedia article on Celestial Coordinate systems contains various conversions, but this one is currently absent.
For a more specific example: I would like to convert Proper motion in ecliptic latitude and longitude from the ATNF catalog into proper motion in galactic coordinates. Using the following notation from the catalog documentation:
PMElong:     Proper motion in the ecliptic longitude direction (mas/yr) 
PMElat:      Proper motion in ecliptic latitude (mas/yr) 
...
ZZ:          Distance from the Galactic plane, based on Dist
XX:          X-Distance in X-Y-Z Galactic coordinate system (kpc)
YY:          Y-Distance in X-Y-Z Galactic coordinate system (kpc)

How would I calculate the following (my own addition) from PMElong & PMElat?
PMZZ:        Proper motion perpendicular to Galactic plane
PMXX:        X-direction proper motion in X-Y-Z Galactic coordinate system (kpc/yr)
PMYY:        Y-direction proper motion in X-Y-Z Galactic coordinate system (kpc/yr)
