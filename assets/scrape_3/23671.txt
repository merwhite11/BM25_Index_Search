Why is the difference between Apollo and Aten asteroids considered meaningful?

I understand the difference between the two to be that they both cross Earth's orbit, but Atens have an orbit smaller than Earth's, and Apollo have an orbit larger, but I don't understand why they aren't simply lumped together in one category.
