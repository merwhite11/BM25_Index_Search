Are white dwarfs the ones always absorbing mass from a companion?

It seems to me every time I see stellar remnant binary systems where there is a white dwarf and another star or something, it appears that the white dwarf always pulls mass from the star.
What if the white dwarf is with a neutron star? Will the white dwarf draw mass from the neutron star? What if the white dwarf was orbiting a supermassive star(not giant stage yet)?
