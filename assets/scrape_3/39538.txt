What would a red giant Sun look like from Proxima b?

As of now, Proxima b is the only confirmed planet (or dwarf planet if it didn't clear its orbit - sorry, couldn't resist) around Proxima Centauri, the nearest-known star to the Sun about 4.2 ly away. From that distance, the Sun looks just like an average star in the night sky. Now if the Sun became a red giant, at 256 times its current diameter (if I recall correctly), what would it look like from Proxima b's night sky? On a good telescope, Betelgeuse is recognizable as more than a dot, its surface is visible, that would surely be the case for a red giant Sun too. What would it take to recognize the Sun's surface from the Proxima system? Would the Sun perhaps even cast a visible shadow?
