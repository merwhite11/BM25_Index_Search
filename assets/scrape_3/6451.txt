How did scientists determine an estimate of the number of planets greater than Sedna's size to exist in the Inner Oort Cloud?

In the article, New Dwarf Planet Found at Solar System's Edge, Hints at Possible Faraway 'Planet X' (Wall, 2014) where they report on research and observations performed by astronomers that discovered the dwarf planet 2012 VP113 which is smaller than, but has an orbit severely elongated like that observed for Sedna.
The article reports the claim from the astronomers who discovered 2012 VP113 that

Based on the amount of sky the scientists searched, Trujillo and Sheppard estimate that about 900 bodies larger than Sedna may exist in this faraway realm, which the astronomers dub the inner Oort Cloud.

How was the estimate, in bold above, calculated?
