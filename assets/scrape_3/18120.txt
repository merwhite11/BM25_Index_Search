How do we know the laws of physics are the same throughout the universe?

How do we know the laws of physics are the same throughout the universe? Intuitively I would say they would vary in two natural ways: the constants in the equations may vary or the math in the equations may vary. As a guess they could change over a long time.
What is the farthest radius we can prove from Earth, with absolute certainty, that the laws of physics do not vary? I am aware this may not be a radius but a more complex shape that cannot be simply described by a radius.
The nearest answer I can think of for a radius is a guess. And that guess is based on the farthest physics experiment we have done from earth, which I think is an experiment with mirrors on the moon. Therefore if we assume (I don't know if this assumption is 100% reasonable) all physics laws hold because this experiment works. Then the radius is the distance to the moon. This doesn't give a concrete answer for the radius, merely an educated guess.
