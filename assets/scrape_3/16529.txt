Will Saturn's Moons be destroyed?

I heard that Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers. Some come within 1km of each other.
How do these moons keep in Saturn's orbit without hitting each other, and someday will these moons collide with each other and be destroyed?
