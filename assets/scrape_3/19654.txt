Why the comets can cross the orbits of planets?

Why are comets able to cross planetary orbits without colliding with the planets - Why is the comets' orbits elliptical, intersecting all the other planets' orbit.
Why don't they get attracted by the planets when they are in their orbit. 
Or, why doesn't the force of gravitation from the planets not attract or compel the comet to rotate around them.
