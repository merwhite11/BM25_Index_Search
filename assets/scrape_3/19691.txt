What percentage of the sky could the sun be in?

For every location on earth, there are parts of the sky that the sun can never be in (e.g., directly overhead anywhere outside the tropics).
I think the sun can be in about 40% of the sky (a hemisphere).
I'll withhold my reasoning/calculations for now, because I'd like the opinion(s) of others more-expert (most are) than me in this subject.
Please weigh in. I believe this "simple" geometric question will have been answered centuries ago, but I have not found it as an answer, nor even as a subject.
