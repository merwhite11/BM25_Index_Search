How did the authors of Surya Siddhanta find the diameters of other planets in the solar system?

The Surya Siddhanta, "a Sanskrit treatise in Indian astronomy from the late 4th-century or early 5th-century CE" is truly a great work.
But how was it possible for the writers to find the exact values of the diameters of different planets and the distance between the sun and the earth?
Also, are there any mistakes in this book?
If there's any problem in my question please inform me.
