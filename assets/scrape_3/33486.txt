What is the apparent magnitude of the faintest stars visible during a full moon?

Assuming the viewer is far from any light pollution, it is a cloudless night, and humidity is very low.  What is the faintest apparent magnitude of stars visible to the naked eye during a full moon (at zenith) if the viewer is looking towards the horizon?
