Edu-Science telescope

I don't know much about astronomy, but my kids are asking for telescopes to view planets, stars etc. Could anyone tell me if this Eduscience telescope is any good?

This kit contains a 40x with a 41cm body, 20x 30x 40x eyepiece, a diagonal mirror, 30mm diameter objective lens and tripod.
Size H51, W44cm.
