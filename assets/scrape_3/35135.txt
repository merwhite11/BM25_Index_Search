What are good resources to study Gravitational Waves?

I am undergraduate student having basic knowledge of Physics. I'm looking for resources (books, video lectures, research papers, etc) to study Gravitational Waves from scratch, I think initially I should practice mathematical physics up to some extent and then proceed for GW.
