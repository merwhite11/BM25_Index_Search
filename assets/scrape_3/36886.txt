Is there a website that shows equivalent views through different telescopes?

I'm trying to buy a beginners telescope. I have a Celestron TravelScope, but would like something better. When I look at other models, many users have posted images from their viewfinders. Is there a site that collates all of these, to give an idea of what I can expect from a given scope (e.g. is Mars just a red dot, can I make out Saturn's rings, what's the detail on the moon like, etc)?
