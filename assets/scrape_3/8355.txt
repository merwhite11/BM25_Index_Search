What is the boundary in the atmosphere seen in this video?

This video, which shows time-lapse views of Earth from the ISS, consistently shows some sort of hard boundary in the atmosphere, below which there seems to be significant reflection from sunlight and/or Earth's cities and above which there seems to be nothing impeding the view of black space.  What is this boundary?  I don't think its the edge of the atmosphere, partly because the atmosphere has no hard edge and partly because the aurorae (an atmospheric phenomenon) seen in the video exist, at least in part, above this boundary.
