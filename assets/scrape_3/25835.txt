How old is the oldest light visible from Earth?

Because light can only travel so fast, all of the light we see in the sky was emitted at a previous moment in time.  So if for example we see a supernova or some other great stellar event, by the time we see it, it maybe long over.  That made me kind of curious, what is the most ancient light we can see from earth?  
The universe is supposedly ~13+ billion years old, but we are probably not at the very edge of the known universe so all the light we see is probably less than 13 billion years old.  So what is the oldest light we can see? and as an optional follow-up question how do we know the age of that light? 
I guess the light itself may not actually be literally 'old', but its probably obvious what I'm asking here, put another way: what's the longest distance that now earth visible light emitted has traveled to reach the earth?  Though that reformation of the question gets kind of tangled with lensing effects.
