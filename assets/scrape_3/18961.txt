Are the compact objects in supernova remnants isolated neutron stars?

It seems all the central compact objects correlated with supernova remnant(SNRs) are isolated, not in binaries, right? 
I find only one exception. A source is claimed to be a compact binary which correlates with SNR G308.3-1.4.ads link
My question is, generally, are the compact objects in SNR always isolated? 
And observationally, are the compact objects in SNRs neutron stars?
