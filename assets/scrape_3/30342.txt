What is the smallest diameter black hole that can be formed naturally?

I was watching the video I Put a 1mm Size Black Hole Next to Earth and This Happened - Universe Sandbox 2 discussing what would happen if a 1 millimeter black hole is orbiting the earth, and I began questioning myself, is it really possible to naturally have such a small black hole?
What is the smallest size that a black hole can form naturally in real life?
