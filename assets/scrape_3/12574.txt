can we use connect a long pipe with space station and use vacuum for fuel transfer?

We all know that we need a lot of fuel to escape from earth. Even 90% fuel of an spaceship is wasted in escaping the earth which definitely affect our power to explore the universe. we have to do a lot of calculations and even a small failure can waste a lot of money. for ex- the Manglayan Indian mission to Mars due to under performance of the engine was almost lost. As it a cheapest mission to Mars. They have a very limited fuel. So why can't we connect our space station with a long pipe and Make our space ship refuel at that point. I know a lot of energy will be required to pump the fuel up. But I was thinking about a better option. why can't we use vacuum to transfer liquid. Like if we have a pipe and we suck one end and the water automatically travels. Is it possible or what are the technical difficulty here.
