Star systems forming when large gravitational force is applied

As far as I'm concerned, most star systems in our galaxy are traveling in fairly circular paths around the black hole at the center. 
Hypothetically, if a large gravitational force pulled star systems closer to the center of our galaxy would binary star systems result? If two stars of different masses were travelling in a centripetal motion around the center of our galaxy, and they were pulled towards the center (which i think would result in two different accelerations completely) could a situation result where two stars collide or join into a system? What is the most probable event to happen in this situation besides two stars not approaching eachother?
