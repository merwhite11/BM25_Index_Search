What can we expect to see with a telescope with a 70mm aperture and a 10mm eyepiece?

We purchased my young daughter a beginner telescope for Christmas and she's super excited to look at the large planets. Our telescope has a 70mm aperture and two eye pieces (10mm and 20mm) How much, if any, detail can we expect to see on Jupiter and Saturn? I don't want her going in expecting to see Saturn's rings and come out disappointed! We are very new to this and I want her to have the best experience possible with the equipment we have. Thanks!
