What object could I have seen at late June on the Sky?

In around late June, I saw two star-like bodies in the sky. At first they appeared to be twinkling, but when I looked closely they appeared to change color; blue, green, a slight red, then yellow.
It freaked me out.
But I'm wondering, did I see dying stars or was it some sort of rare phenomenon occurring because of the earth's atmosphere or was it something else?
