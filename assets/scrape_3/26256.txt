Is the moon's revolution speed increasing or decreasing

I've come across multiple answers to this question. So, the moon is moving away from the Earth a couple of centimeters per year and the Earth's rotation is slowing down. Here it says the moon's revolution is speeding up, another place it says it is slowing down. So, due to tidal effects, is the moon's revolution slowing down or speeding up?
