Synthesising types of galaxies using various stellar spectra

I have asked this on Physics Stack Exchange but Astronomy is probably more appropriate. I have been given the task of synthesising an elliptical galaxy, a starburst galaxy and a spiral galaxy (considering the arms and the bulge separately and adding them) using stellar spectra which I have classified. I need to add different weightings of five types of stars to produce a normalised spectrum of each of these galaxies. I have spectra for giants, main sequence stars and sub-giants with varying stellar types (O, B, A, F, G, K, M). I know that Spiral arms and the starburst are going to be primarily young stars, while the spiral bulge and the elliptical will be of older stars, but I have no idea which types or luminosity classes of stars I would use and their weightings in each. Can anyone offer any information or resources where I would find good information on adding different types of star to 'create' a galaxy?
