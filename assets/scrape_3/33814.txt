Proxima as Supernova

Follow this question. If a star at the same distance from us as, say, Proxima Centauri had exploded as a Supernova 4 years ago (I know, it can't explode as supernova, let's say it can)...
How bright will it be?
It will impact us (life on earth and/or technology)?
What about Sirius?
