What is 'non-detection' of a Supernova?

This may have a simple answer but I can't find it. 
I've come across this term in a paper I was reading,  (Walmswell and Elridge, 2011) which mentions 'non-detection' of Supernovae, and while I can wrap my head around detection, I was lost at 'non'.
I tried finding a definition but to no avail. Would anyone be able to give one?
