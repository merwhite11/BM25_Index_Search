If we pumped an large EMP into High Earth orbit and it detinated would it act as a shield against solar radiation?

Could this pulse potentially shield spacecraft from harmful solar radiation.
I was assuming an EMP would have little effect as a radiation shield because the pulse would not be rapid enough to counter act the suns energy
f we pumped an EMP into high earth orbit and it detinated would it create a pocket of radiation-free space
