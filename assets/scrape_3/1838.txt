Why does e.g. Hubble's secondary mirror not block part of the picture?

The SOHO observatory has an opaque object in the light path that blocks the direct light from the sun making it possible to observe the corona.
Hubble and many other telescopes have a big primary mirror in the bottom of a tube which bounces light on to a smaller secondary mirror at the opening of the tube. Why doesn't that other mirror cause a circular area of "no data" in the middle of the resulting images?
