Bright, brief light in sky this morning (daytime) - satellite flare?

This morning at 8:00am UK time, give or take about 3 minutes, I saw a very bright light in the sky which seemed to get a little brighter, lasting for maybe 5 seconds after I first noticed it, then faded out to nothing for a few seconds, then came back for another few seconds and disappeared entirely.
I was at around the following co-ordinates, and I was looking towards the South:
Lat: 51.980619 Long: -0.8443739614449441
I'd say it was at something like 30 degrees inclination but that's a really rough guess. It was somewhere around a third to half way between the horizon and overhead.
I know there are duplicate questions about this kind of thing BUT I believe this is different because:

I saw it during daylight. The sun was up, albeit behind clouds.
The light was VERY bright, when I first saw it I thought it was Venus but then it obviously faded out. I think it was probably even brighter than Venus would have been.
I have already ruled out Iridium flares by looking at Heavens Above. I have seen Iridium flares once or twice before and I think it looked similar.

Presumably there aren't too many objects in the sky that can get that bright. Are there any other objects which I could track apart from Iridium sats? Can anybody else find anything it might have been?
