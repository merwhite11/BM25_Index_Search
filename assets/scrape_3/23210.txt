Did the scientists really observed gold and platinum being created from kilonova?

I read that after LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected gravitational waves signal from a kilonova, many ground based telescopes quickly turns their mirrors towards the spot and "sees" gold and platinum ,etc other heavy elements over the next few days. Is it really possible to directly observe heavy elements being formed consider that the event occurs at a distance of around 130 millions light year away?
