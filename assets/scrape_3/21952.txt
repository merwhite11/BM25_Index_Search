How do I imagine time difference?

I could never understand how in Interstellar, they say our every hour spent on the planet is equal to 7 years on Earth and when he returns back to her daughter, the father is older than her daughter. How is this possible when both the planet over there and Earth and for the fact everything in the universe is moving with the same time reference point. The age of daughter and father should have been the same.
I don't know but is this termed as Time Dilation ?
How does this work ?
Please avoid any formulae in explanation.
