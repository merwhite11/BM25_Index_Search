Are we center of universe?

So I just learned that CMB redshift is 1100 regardless where we look (up down left right). According to Hubble's Law that makes it around 46 billion light years away, making it the farthest matter away from us. If CMB redshift is the same regardless which direction we look, then how could that be unless we're in the center of the universe?
