Could binary gas giants have ring and moon systems?

Would any moons/rings around either of the gas giants stay intact or get ripped apart by the tidal forces between the two giants? If any moons/rings are able to form around either of the giants, is there a limit to how large a ring system could be, or how far a moon could orbit?
