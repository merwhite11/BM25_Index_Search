Where can I find detail on interpreting the exo-planet transit-data graphics used in the Zooniverse Project?

I'm participating in the Zooniverse Exoplanet-explorers project (transit method), which provides only minimal guidance on interpreting their light curve and transit data graphics, as visible here:

Can anyone point me to source(s) that will help me read these graphs in detail, pls?

UPDATE: Just located NASA Exo-PLanet Archive which looks like it might hold what iSeek. But further recommendations would be appreciated.
