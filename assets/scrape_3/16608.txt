Energy carried by solar wind

What are the velocity, mass, and charge distribution of the solar wind.

Near the earth within the magnetosphere in the ecliptic
Near the earth but outside the magnetosphere in the ecliptic
Outside the ecliptic at 1 AU

I would like to understand the energy content of the solar wind, and how it compares with the solar radiation(solar constant is $1360\, Wm^{-2}$)?
