Help w/ Hubble's Law + Doppler Effect.

I had a question about the following chart. What mathematical observation or equation could be made about the data given in respect to the doppler effect? I'm confused if this means that planets are moving at an exponential rate away from us? Would these galaxies appear blue shifted? Thank you in advance for any sort of help.
