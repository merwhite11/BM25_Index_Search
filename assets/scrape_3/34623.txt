Does a black hole necessarily contain a singularity?

I'm basing this hypothesis on the theories around how an outside observer watching something fall into a black hole will never actually see the thing pass the event horizon. And secondly that from the perspective of the thing falling in, the surrounding universe would accelerate to see the end of the universe.
On that second point, the "end of the universe" from my understanding would be up until the black hole evaporates.

So the question. Is it possible for an event horizon to form; not necessarily from a singularity, but merely from there being enough compressed mass existing within the boundaries that an event horizon forms?

The implication from this if it has any merit would be in my opinion, that there are no singularities currently in existence and that there indeed might never be one, because currently I don't understand how something "inside" a black hole is capable of moving at all (I assume that to do so mass would need to move faster than light), suggesting that the entirety of a stellar remnant's mass is stuck in place both inside and on the surface of the event horizon.
EDIT: Re-reading that last paragraph I've confused myself a little, mass wouldn't necessarily be "stuck", but if it did move at all, it would be moving light speed, which is a paradox in itself?
