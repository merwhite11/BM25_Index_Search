Does the Milky Way orbit around anything?

We know most of the objects in the Universe have a spherical or elliptical shape. The object which has less mass and gravitational pull orbits around the nearest object with more mass and gravitational pull. For example:

Moon orbits around Earth
Earth orbits around Sun
Sun orbits around Sagittarius A* which is the center of Milky Way.

Thus, is the Milky Way orbiting around some object or perhaps Black Hole?
I know that the Milky Way is going towards Andromeda as they are attracting each other and they will collide with each other after 3 billion years to 6 billion years. But it is possible that the Milky way is orbiting around some object at the same time? Perhaps both galaxies are present in a group of galaxies which is orbiting around some object. 
If the Milky Way is not orbiting around some object then is there any proof found by the scientists for that?
