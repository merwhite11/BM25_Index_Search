Terminology of Orbits

A hopefully simple terminology question:  When you have an object that orbits another object in space, what do you call the object being orbited in relation to the object orbiting?
For instance, you might call the object orbiting the "satellite" of the orbited object, but what would you call the object being orbited?  
Orbitee is all i've been able to come up with but it doesn't seem quite right ;)
