How Did Early Astronomers Measure Distances?

Prior to the era of radar and other forms of radio/RF/EM ranging, what approaches, methods, and techniques did early astronomers (e.g., Kepler, Cassini, Copernicus) use to measure the distance(s) from Earth to various objects (such as: Mars, Venus, Alpha Centauri, etc.)?
Is there an especially informative article (say, Scientific American, Sky) or book that explains their efforts and results (e.g., how accurate were their computations?)?
