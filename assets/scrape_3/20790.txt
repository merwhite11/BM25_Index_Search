Appearance of sun at geologic past

After origin of Earth ( 4.54 billion years ago ) to today; what are the changes  through-which the sun undergone with time? , ( if seen from Earth. )
I'm doing some palaeobiology-landscape rendering; so I'm thinking if I want to add the sun in such pictures; should I draw it just like present day? Or the look/ appearance (colour, size, flames, position, halo etc) varied in observable amount through the geologic time-scale(precambrian-cambrian-ordovician-silurian-devonian-carboniferous-permian-triassic-jurassic-cretaceous-palaeogene-neogene etc). (the timescale terms provided just to hint the answerer the level of details may NOT to go )
Update: Here I attach a  small version of geologic time table to indicate time ranges.
