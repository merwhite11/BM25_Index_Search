Would an object shot from earth fall into the sun?
If an object is shot at 107,000 km/h via rocket or otherwise, in the opposite direction to our orbit about the sun, it will be traveling at 0 km/h relative to the sun. The moon is not close enough to the object to have a significant force for the purposes of this question.
Will this object start accelerating towards the sun or will it somehow fall into another stable orbit?
Could it instead get trapped in the L4 Earth-Sun Lagrange point?
