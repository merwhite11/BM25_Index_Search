Why do stars seem not to move relative to each other?

Whilst I understand why stars move across our skies,(Earth rotation) I struggle to understand why they do not appear to move relative to each other.
To explain:  Take the best know constellation the Plough.  It is a familiar site to most people.  But it has been there apparently un-changed for years.  If we (I mean earth, moon, stars and everything else ) are hurtling through space, then surely changes should be apparent unless we are all travelling in the same direction at exactly the same speed.
