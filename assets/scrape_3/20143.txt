Exo Planets and Planets difference?

After hearing that it has been confirmed that we found seven similar exoplanets like earth. I thought exoplanets were dead stars. After doing a little bit of research I found out that exoplanets are planets that are orbiting a star, NOT the sun. But isn't a star like the Sun? Can someone please explain this to me?
