What is the exact time of sun stay in each zodiac every year on sidereal year duration?

I tried to reverse engineer from astro-chart times at which sun stays in a zodiac.
Here is the list.
Sun_Stay_zodiac  timeofstay_sec   timeofstay_days
  1  Aries         2672700     30 day 22 hour 00 minute
  2  Taurus        2714700     31 day 10 hour 05 minute
  3  Gemini        2734080     31 day 15 hour 28 minute
  4  Cancer        2719440     31 day 11 hour 24 minute
  5  Leo           2680080     31 day 00 hour 28 minute
  6  Virgo         2586960     29 day 22 hour 00 minute
  7  Libra         2626020     30 day 09 hour 27 minute
  8  Scorpio       2548020     29 day 11 hour 47 minute
  9  Sagittarius   2533080     29 day 07 hour 38 minute
 10  Capricorn     2544240     29 day 10 hour 44 minute
 11  Aquarius      2576520     29 day 19 hour 42 minute
 12  Pisces        2622540     30 day 22 hour 25 minute

Since the orbit of earth is elliptical and therefore also variation is orbital speed the stay of sun in each zodiac is different i.e Maximum at Gemini and after 6 months minimum at Sagittarius. However when I add them up sums up to 31558380 seconds which is 230.495 seconds than time in seconds in sidereal year ie 31558149.504 Now what I am looking for is more exact time duration of sun stay in each zodiac that includes seconds. I hope this data that I have in my question will help others too.
