If I could see from a Gravitational-Time dilated place to somewhere far which is not dilated, would I see fast moving people?

Gravitational time dilation like the one shown in the movie Interstellar, causes time to move slowly for someone within the high gravity reference frame. Now let's say that from such a place, I was able to view through a telescope somewhere far away which is not gravitationally dilated. And assume that I am able to view the near live video stream of it. Would those people look fast moving?
