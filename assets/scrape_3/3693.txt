How many stars are visible to naked eyes around Equator area?

In the best sky conditions, we can see about 44,000 stars in the sky. But what if I am located around Equator area? How many stars I can see? 
From what I know, the number of stars I can see should be far less ( I don't know why, though). Is it true? If yes, why?
