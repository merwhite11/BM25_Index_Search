From our world's perspective, does the full moon look larger in one city than it does in another?

When I was a very little girl, my dad talked about the HUGE full moon he saw while in the navy. He made the comment during a full moon we were having in Western NYS. He said, this (harvest) moon is nothing compared to the one he saw. 
Now years later, I was with my grown son, who's a geologist and who has been all over the world but not during a full moon. He told me my dad was wrong. My son said that the full moon is always about the size of a penny when you hold the penny up to compare the size of the moon to it. 
But I have seen pictures of HUGE full moons over cities my whole life and I assumed my dad was correct. Is there a place where I can travel to see a HUGE full moon that would be much bigger than the full moon I see from the shores of Lake Erie? I understand that the horizon makes the moon bigger but the pictures I have seen were not moons on the horizon. 
I've searched Stacker's data base but I didn't see this question.
