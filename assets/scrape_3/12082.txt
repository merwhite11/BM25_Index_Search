Is ours the first universe?

I see here that after a very long time into the future, "Estimated time for random quantum fluctuations to generate a new Big Bang".
This begs the question, do we speculate that our big bang was the first?  Or are we one of many in a never ending chain?  Or do I miss the point entirely (being ignorant in the subject)?
