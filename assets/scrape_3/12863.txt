Can any stars ever form supermassive black holes?

I heard that most supermassive blackholes are not formed by stars â€“ in fact, we aren't even sure how they're formed. But could a star, with enough mass and low enough metallicity, form a supermassive black hole? Rather, would there be any stars that fit this category?
