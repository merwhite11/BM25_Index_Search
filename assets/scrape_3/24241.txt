Altitude of Midnight Satellite?

The other night, I observed what I believe must have been a satellite, however it was at 1:30am so I was not sure that this would be possible. Being in the Southern Hemisphere we are just past Summer Solstice, so theoretically it could have been reflecting the sun's light.
There were no flashing lights, just a star-like point of light. As it slowly traveled in a NE direction across the sky, it began to gradually fade as typical of a satellite passing into Earth's shadow.
Based on my observation, I'd like to get an understanding of the approximate minimum altitude of the object that I observed, allowing for it to be out of the shadow of the Earth sunlight. I'm not a mathematician, but using Space Engine with the correct time & location, I had to position the camera to some 7000km in altitude before the sun was visible over the horizon. The object was N to NE from where I observed it, whist the midnight sun would have been shining away at the South Pole.
