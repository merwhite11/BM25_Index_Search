Is there a way to factor age into the mass-luminosity relationship for stars?

I'm wondering if there's a way to formulate the luminosity of a star not only as a function of mass, but of age, too, and if so, what the formula for luminosity would look like. In the case of the Sun I'm aware it gets 10% brighter every billion or so years, but I doubt this relationship holds true for all mass ranges of stars, just like you have to adjust the formula for the luminosity mass relationship for stars of different masses. 
If anyone could "shed some light" on this matter, it would be very much appreciated.
