How was lunar eclipse proven using the scientific method?

I read a few articles about lunar eclipses and while they explain the science behind them, they do not describe who explained it and how it was explained using the scientific method. 
Some of them refer to Aristotle 2000 years ago; however, I that didn't really take any measurements using telescopes. 
Has anyone in history ever conducted measurements/experiments to "prove" lunar eclipses?
