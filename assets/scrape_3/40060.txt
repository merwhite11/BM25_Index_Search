Is there any scientific correlation between cold nights and star-lit skies?

I've many times heard expressions such "cold, starry nights". It's apparently poetic to describe star-lit night skies as being "cold".
Is this based on reality in some way? Is there something about cold weather which would make the stars more visible from Earth?
I've been taking many nightly walks and, maybe, I'd say that the stars seem to be more visible when it's cold/winter. But I'm far from sure about that; it's useless as "evidence". I don't really see why this would be. Seems like it would have more to do with how cloudy it is.
