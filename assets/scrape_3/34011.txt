How long for the sun to traverse its diameter at the pole?

As the sun rises once per year at the north/south pole, the time taken to rise (and set) must also take significantly more time to complete to rise (and set).
How long does this take at either pole? 
Interested to know if it is the same percentage of a day as anywhere else on earth (the day at the pole being several months long).
