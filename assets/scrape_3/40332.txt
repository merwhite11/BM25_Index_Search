Which star has the highest mass loss rate?

We have known lists of stars with high luminosity, temperature, mass, size, and much more. However, I have not seen a list that compares each star's mass loss rates. So, which star (or stars) have the highest mass loss rates, and is it going to be more likely to be an LBV, RSG, or a WR star?
