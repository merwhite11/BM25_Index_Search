What does designation VY, NML, UU in star names stand for?

I've read the a IAU page on the subject but i am no closer to understanding how this works. Also did search the already asked question, but didn't see anything on the subject.
What does bolded item in the names below stand for? How do they choose them?

VY Canis Majoris
NML Cygni
UY Scuti
