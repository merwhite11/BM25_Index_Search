Sun like star in our milkyway?

Is there any popular star or one which we can see with our naked eyes in our milky way that is atleast 90% sun-like(mass,radius,spectra,luminosity).The important thing is it must not be a binary.
Its okay if its not visible to our naked eyes because our sun's absolute magnitude is +4.5!.
