Regarding the age / size of the Universe

I believe the current estimated age of the Universe is around 14 billion years.  I just read in another post on here that the diameter of the Universe is around 90 billion light years.  This doesn't make sense to me, shouldn't the radius of the Universe be equal to it's age?  Unless the explosion caused particles to spread out faster than the speed of light? Is that possible? I thought the speed of light was a speed limit that nothing can exceed?
Sorry if there is something I'm not understanding here or if I'm trying to compare apples to oranges.  I'm only an astronomy enthusiast.
