Why is constant velocity drift not an accepted explanation of Hubble expansion?


Edward A Milne at the Oxford University proposed that what Hubble was
  observing was simply a natural sorting of random galactic motions. If
  a group of galaxies formed together moving at various speeds, it was
  natural that the fastest ones would now be the most distant, while the
  slow-moving ones would remain nearby.

Why is this incorrect?
I understand that gravity wouldn't normally allow expansion at constant velocity, but we have already conjectured dark energy to account for that.
