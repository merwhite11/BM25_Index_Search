What is the farthest point of light that is emitted by a torch?

If I focus my torch into the night sky,what would be the farthest point the light can reach? Recently I looked at the night sky and noticed a light spark moving around the clouds for about 15 min.After observation I jumped into a conclusion that its probably because of the light house near by or any powerful light emitter.
