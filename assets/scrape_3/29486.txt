Are there any ways in which the light time difference between the center and the edge of the solar disk is noticeable?

In the ABC News video New space discovery has astronomers buzzing at about 02:30 Dr. Hakeem M. Oluseyi explains that the shortness of FRBs (before dispersion) suggests a compact source size and illustrates this by using the Sun as an example. 
I'd never though about this until just now, but the radius of the Sun is indeed about 2.3 light-seconds. It takes light from the edge of the Sun's disk over 2 seconds longer to reach us than light from the central area.
Are there any ways in which this light time difference is noticeable, or needs to be taken into account?
