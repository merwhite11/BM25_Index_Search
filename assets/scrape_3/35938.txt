Is there an online planetarium where the observer is on another celestial body?

I know about in-the-sky.org and its online planetarium feature, but that's from the Earth's perspective. Is there a planetarium (preferably online but if not, that's fine) where the observer is on another celestial body, like the Moon or Mars?
