Escaping a black hole

I often hear that nothing can escape a black hole because its "escape velocity" is greater than c. If that is accurate, what about the following? I know that the following has a lot of most likely impossible assumptions, but I'm trying to understand whether the escape velocity explanation makes sense.
Suppose you've got some sort of space ship that's inside the event horizon, and it hasn't been destroyed by the gravity or tidal forces. Also suppose that you've got a whole lot of reaction mass and a fantastic power supply.
Could this space ship, through applying enough constant force escape the event horizon?
