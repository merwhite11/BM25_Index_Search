Did I see a meteor(oid) or space debris or something else?

About three years ago I think, at night I've seen something enter the atmosphere in a glowing bright fireball. But I think it wasn't the fire from burning up, but because of ionization (what also happens to meteors) but I might be wrong and it may have indeed been fire. There was also a kind of a contrail behind the glowing ball (which was visible only in the vicinity of the ball). It was in November in the northern hemisphere, so it might have been a Leonid, but it didn't look like the usual meteors. It was much slower and brighter. It was cloudy that night and eventually it disappeared behind a cloud. Whatever it was, it wasn't a typical meteor nor was it an airplane (it was quite straight above me, soundless and it was something entering the atmosphere).
My guess is it was either a meteoroid that was very dense and comparably big (several feet) and a comparably slow one, or it was some retired satellite or some spacecraft debris entering the atmosphere. What do you think?
update: I estimate its speed at about 1/6 that of a typical shower meteor.
