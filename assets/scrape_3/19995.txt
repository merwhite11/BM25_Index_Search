Eccentric Earth Orbit and Day/Night Cycles

If the Earth's rotational axis was perpendicular to the orbital plane, but the orbit also highly eccentric (sun at center), how would that affect the day/night cycles? 
What I think is that during the time the Earth's closer to the sun, because the gravitational pull is stronger, it would make the Earth spin faster than thereby creating much shorter days than if the Earth was near the focii of the orbit (on which the days/nights would be longer). Is this line of thinking correct?
