Do the Bullet Cluster remnants prove that dark matter consists out of particles?

Some time ago the remnants of a collision between two collections of stars were discovered. These remnants are called the Bullet Cluster:

The color blue (non-visible in reality) represents the presence of dark matter. Pink represents the normal matter (I'm not sure if the color pink in this picture is actually visible, contrary to the blue).
There are some theories around to explain the nature of dark matter. They can roughly be divided into two groups:

Theories that state, dark matter consists of particles
Theories that modify gravity (apart from MOND) itself, for example, the theory propagated by the Dutch physicist Erik Verlinde (who's "contraption" here in the Netherlands was announced on TV as a huge breakthrough and for he received the Spinoza Prize. i.e. a lot of money, in 2011; much too much, in my opinion) which see gravity as entropic.

Theories of a modified gravity make the prediction that dark matter is tied to normal matter. Now in pictures of the bullet cluster, it seems like matter and dark matter are clearly separated.
Does this prove that dark matter has to consist out of particles?
