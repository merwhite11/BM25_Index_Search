Do we finally have a decent set of parameters of 162173 Ryugu?

"Give a man a watch and he will know the time; give him two and he will never be sure" - this was my impression when reading the Wikipedia article on 162173 Ryugu.

Mean diameter:

0.865±0.015 km[3]
0.87 km[4]
0.90±0.14 km[5]
0.92±0.12 km[6]
0.980±0.029 km[7]
1.13±0.03 km[8]


And no mass estimates at all.
Now that Hayabusa2 has arrived, do we have solid measurements of Ryugu's size and mass yet?
