Why can't we see the supermassive black holes supposedly at the center of galaxies?

Is gravitational lensing responsible for obscuring (figuratively) the supposed supermassive black holes at the center of our own and other galaxies? By "see" I mean relative to the measuring tools we are using. A radio telescope "sees" in radio waves. 
In Hubble photos of galaxies, no black holes appear to be present in galaxy centers, at least not visually. How can this be explained?
