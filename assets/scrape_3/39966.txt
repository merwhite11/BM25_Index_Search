How does the Sun's gravity have so much force and pull on the solar system? How does it scale?

Ok, so the distances are huge. And the sizes are much different. But I wonder how then the sun keeps the planets etc. orbiting it. If we swap out all those objects in the video (soccer ball for the sun, grapes, pin heads, etc.) for equivalently sized balls of iron, equally dense objects, they would have a negligible pull on each other.
A ball of iron the size of a football could never keep a grape 4 football fields away orbiting it. Or could it? Is gravity proportionate? At larger star and planet sizes, it pulls harder?
What is the explanation here?
