What will happen when landing on Jupiter?

Jupiter is a gas giant, so landing on it will not be like landing on Earth, our Moon or Mars etc., as it does not have a solid surface like these.
If we have a hypothetical spaceship or probe landing on Jupiter, and it can withstand the enormous pressure, what or how will be the sequence of events?
I already read this:

A major problem in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet
  has no solid surface on which to land, as there is a smooth transition
  between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes
  descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense
  pressures within Jupiter.

What I do not understand:

Is this enormous or immense pressure of atmosphere or Jupiter's surface?
While descending, will we know that we have transitioned from the atmosphere to the surface?
Why does animated footage (real or conceptual) of Jupiter appear like a high viscous liquid (e.g. lava) rotating in an opposite direction, rather that gas(es)?
Does Jupiter have an inner solid core?


I've already gone through these:

Is Jupiter made entirely out of gas?
Could we fly/drive through Jupiter?
If Jupiter is a gas-giant then why don't its features change?
