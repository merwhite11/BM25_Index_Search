Star formation: When a nebula collapses, is it only the gasses that form the star?

A nebula is made of dust (elements heavier than He and H) and gas (H and He).
Stars are made when nebulae's collapse and hydrogen begins to fuse. 99% of nebula material goes into making the star. The left-over 0.01 of debris creates planets.
Does 99% of nebula material that makes the star only consist of gas (He/H) and the 0.01% is the dust which makes the planets?
Question Clarification:
Are the constituents of the 99% of mass that makes the star and the 0.01% mass that makes the planets the same?
I.e.   

Does both the 99% and 0.01% compose of mainly He/H and a small portion of metals (meaning the star contains heavier elements like Si and Fe etc before fusion?)
OR 
is 99% of the nebula composed of He/H, which collapses to form the star, and 0.01% consists of heavier elements that make the planets?
