Will I be able to see both Jupiter and Saturn at the same time in my Astromaster 114?

I have a Celestron Astromaster 114 Newtonian reflector telescope. The specs:

aperture: 114mm
focal length: 1000mm
focal ratio: f/8.77

I also have a t-ring so I can connect a Nikon camera to it.
Will I be able to see both Jupiter and Saturn at the same time thru this telescope? I understand from this article that they will come within a tenth of a degree of each other. The article says this is "fifth of the width of the full moon" which, based on my experience, suggests that I will indeed be able to see both, but I'm hardly any expert.
I'm considering borrowing a friend's film camera to try and snap a photo of both in one image, but would like to avoid the trouble (thanks, COVID!) if this won't happen.
