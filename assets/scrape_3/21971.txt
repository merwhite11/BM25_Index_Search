How do I align my finder scope National Geographic 76/700 EQ

Telescope :  National Geographic 76/700 EQ
I tried aiming my telescope at the moon but I just couldn't do it, it was so hard to do, my finder scope isn't helping at all and I watched a bunch of videos saying to use the screws to align the finder scope but the screws on my finder scope don't do anything. Any suggestions?? I really need help tonight is cloudy and I only get like 5 minutes every hour to look at the moon
