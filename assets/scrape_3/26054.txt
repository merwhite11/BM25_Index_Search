Names of specific galaxies in Hubble's XDF

I was wondering if there was some kind of database for the galaxies that appear in the XDF. Like their scientific names, coordinates, distances, and etc.
Here's a link to the image I am using for the project: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/xdf.html
