Why is this telescope so short? How hard is it to make such a fast primary?

The recently discovered object C/2019 Q4 (Borisov) is in the news because it might have an eccentricity greater than one, which means it might be from outside the solar system, though not necessarily.
MPEC 2019-R106 estimates e=3.08.
I looked at Sky and Telescope's Is Another Interstellar Visitor Headed Our Way? which shows the image and caption below.
Although it is impossible to be sure from only this photograph, the 0.65 m telescope looks like the distance from primary to the small secondary is only about 1 meter, maybe 1.2 at most. 
Questions: 

Why is this telescope so short? 
How hard is it to make such a fast (and therefore deep) primary?
