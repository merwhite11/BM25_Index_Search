Photographing Mars, Jupiter and Saturn

I want to take pictures of planets, well at least Mars, Jupiter and Saturn with some surface details.
I have a Canon EOS 7D Mark-II and a Tameron 150 - 600mm lens (very heavy), a 1.7X extender, and a... meh... half decent tripod that can take a peak in the sky directly overhead, with some neck discomfort. So far, I have been able to only capture a fuzzy blob of Mars with aura of orangish red light around it. But that is partly because the skies were not very clear, and some clouds quickly tried to hide the sky when they saw me taking a picture.  And it is Late October. So... Any suggestions, ideas,
