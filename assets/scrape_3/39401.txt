What orbital period would produce one New Moon (and one Full Moon) each year? What other effects would this produce?

I am interested to know whether it's possible for the moon to orbit the earth at such a rate that we would see only one New Moon and one Full Moon a year. If so, what other effects would we experience?
I at first assumed this would be a one-year period, and technically I think that would produce one New Moon, but that single New Moon would last all year (i.e., you would never see the moon). So I'm interested to know if there is an orbital period that would give us one New Moon and one Full Moon, as seen from our earth, each year.
As I hold my hands up in front of my face and experimentally rotate them around each other, I want to say a six-month period would produce this effect, but I'm not sure that's correct, so I'd appreciate a word from anyone who actually knows what they're talking about. Thanks!
(Apologies if this has been asked before; I wasn't able to find it.)
