Space Travel and length of time

So I read that if an astronaut travels at the speed of light and goes to a nearby star system , when he or she returns, he or she will have aged 10 years but 1000 years will have gone by on Earth. Travel at the speed of light is not achievable ,so I was wondering if the spacecraft was traveling at an achievable speed of 10% the speed of light , how much will the astronaut have aged and how much time has elapsed here on Earth upon the return of the astronaut ?
