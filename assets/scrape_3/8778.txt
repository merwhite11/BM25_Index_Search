Why are gas giants colored the way they are?

As I understand it, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are all made primarily from varying proportions of hydrogen and helium.  Despite this, Jupiter is very red, Saturn is yellow, and Uranus and Neptune are blue.  Why the difference in colors for planets with similar chemical makeups?  Or do they not have similar chemical makeups?
If such an explanation is available, I would like specific descriptions of why each planet is colored the way it is.
