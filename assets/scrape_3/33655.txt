Can fish and other sea creatures survive in watery planets like Neptune or any other planets that has water?

I'm a bit curious since Neptune does not have a land surface and it is covered with water, I mean water has oxygen right? What will happen if we put some sea creatures in these watery planets? Can they survive or live? I'm not referring to Neptune alone, I mean all the planets that has some large amount of water in it. Thanks.
