If we found evidence of life on Mars, how would we know that it originated on Mars rather than Earth?

Consider this scenario.  One of the probes sent to Mars either very soon, or within the next century, finds conclusive micro-fossil evidence that life once existed on Mars.
One theory today that is quite common is that life might that have arisen on Mars was then ejected into space, floated to Earth and then seeded life on our planet.
I'm tracking with you and that could make sense, assuming we found the conclusive evidence for life on Mars.  However, why would we assume that the early martian life originated on Mars, rather than Earth?  Is it not likely that somewhere between 2.5-3 billion years ago, a major volcanic eruption or meteor impact could have hit an earth teeming with simple-life and sent it hurdling through space to Mars?
I understand that my theory has the gravity of the sun working against it, but I also see it not being entirely impossible.  I mean, 100 years ago, one could assume that life originating on Mars and then being sent this was was ridiculous and impossible but now it's a rational, viable theory.
Considering such a scenario, how would scientist verify that these life-forms didn't originate from Earth, rather than Mars?  It seems to me that this question is the first question that would need to be asked and answered after the fossil-records were found and verified.
