Why aren't neutron stars full of dark matter?

Dark matter interacts with the gravitational force right? Well, unlike black holes, neutron stars are actually visible, and they're an enormous gravitational sink, so dark matter should collect to them. 
But if all that is true, which it seems to be, why haven't astronomers detected or used neutron stars to detect dark matter?
