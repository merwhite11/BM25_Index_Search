Do changes in the orbit of the Earth contribute to global warming?


Researchers have largely put to rest a long debate on the underlying mechanism that has caused periodic ice ages on Earth for the past 2.5 million years â€“ they are ultimately linked to slight shifts in solar radiation caused by predictable changes in Earth's rotation and axis.

How do we know that the amount of solar irradiation has increased since the ice age. Do current changes in the orbit path still cause the average temperature to still be increasing until another such event causes another orbit change?
This appears to be the article.
