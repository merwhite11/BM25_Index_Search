Does the Milky Way's movement through space have spacetime implications?

The way I usually see spacetime explained, it says that if you just sit still, you are moving at 0kph and so you are moving at maximum speed through time (ie. time for you is flowing at maximum speed).  However, sitting still we're moving at the speed of our galaxy through space, which is about 600km/s.  The speed of light is about 300,000km/s.  So for simplicity's sake, let's say the galaxy is actually moving through space at 1,000km/s.  Does this in fact mean that if I sit still on Earth, time for me is actually flowing 1/300th slower than if I were sitting still with respect to the universe?  And does it also mean that if the Milky Way were travelling at 99% the speed of light, time for me would be flowing at 1% the rate of the flow of time for someone that was sitting still with respect to the universe?
