What type of spectrum does the Wolf-Rayet star WR137 have?


Is it an Emission Spectra or an Absorption Spectra?
I think that it's an absorption spectrum, but then why is the light intensity curve focused on elements that should not be in the star in this case, like the carbon at position 4658?
PS: I do not study physics or astronomy or anything like that :)
