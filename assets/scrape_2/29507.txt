What is Earth believed to have looked like before the collision with Theia?

Let's assume the moon was formed because Earth collided into Theia. (There are numerous other theories, but this one is the most widely accepted.)
In that case, are there theories that address what the Earth surface looked like? E.g. would the Earth have had bodies of water at the time? 
I've read some websites and a book!, and some say it did, some say it did not.
