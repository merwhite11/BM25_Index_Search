Has any moon achieved "retrograde equatorial orbit"?

There are many moons which have low (almost negligible) inclination and can be considered to rotate at the planet's equatorial plane. For instance, Galilean moons have almost negligible inclination (< 1$^\circ$) and so they are considered to have a "prograde equatorial orbit".
OTOH, "Retrograde equatorial orbit" is that orbit which has an inclination of exactly 180째 (or near 180째). Has any moon achieved such kind of orbit? I have found some Saturnian moons (or moonlets) which have inclination around 177째 and didn't found anything beyond that. Why is it hard to achieve a "Retrograde equatorial orbit"?

Tangentially related questions: Can a moon rotate perpendicular to planet's plane? [90째 inclination] (Theoretically yes, practically hard to achieve; See Kozai Mechanism)
