Why doesn't the black hole in the center of the Milky Way glow similarly to the famous M87 image?

The M87 image made some astronomers famous recently as the first image of a black hole.
In the Milky Way, it has been concluded that there must be a black hole due to the movement of stars near the center. But why is there no such light effect in our black hole, as there is in M87? Or is it there, but we cannot see it for some reason?
