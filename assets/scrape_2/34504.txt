Why is this shooting star wavy or squiggly toward the end of it's visible streak

I was taking photos of some stars when I noticed this shooting star was wavy toward the end (start?) of it's trail. My cousin suggesting that it could be the CCD in my camera or as it spiralling as it enters the atmosphere. This is a heavily cropped image
