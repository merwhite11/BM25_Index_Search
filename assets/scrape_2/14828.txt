Why was the size of the solar system not defined by Mercury Transits?

The first measurements of the (absolute) size of the solar system was made using the Transit of Venus, an event that arguably will only happen twice in a lifetime.
Transits of Mercury occur far more often. Why have astronomers had to wait for Venus Transits to make historical measurements of the size of the solar system?
