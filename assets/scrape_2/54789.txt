How can we measure the amount of Dark Matter in the universe to the level of a percent?

Through phenomena that scientists have observed we know that dark matter is a big player in maintaining a constant speed of objects in a galaxy which means that dark matter is an active participant. Now many scientists have concluded that dark matter makes up 85% of all the matter in the universe and what I wonder is that how can we approximate that value with only observations of the universe? If possible I would like to know about the idea in depth. Thank you.
