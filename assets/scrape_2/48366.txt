Flashes in the Sky

Short Version: went camping into a very dark, remote location with clear air, no moon.
Was able to see everything from the Pleiades and Orion, to the Southern Cross and the Magellanic Clouds (I live in Chile).
Within the Milky Way arm belt, we saw a noticeable flash; very quick; very short. Nothing crazy bright, but enough to catch our eyes while laying down looking up star gazing.
I want to say it was a distant supernova, but everything I read says "no they are too rare, etc."
We have seen maybe 5-6 in the last few years. Saw a couple up in the Atacama Desert as well...
Are these indeed supernovas or something else? While looking up it just looks like a really bright star or Jupiter/Venus, then in a nanosecond it's gone.
Please help!
