Spectra: What is that Supposed to Mean?

I've found this website (click here for the link), the link leads you to a problem about the velocity Andromeda is going towards the Milky way galaxy, and you can try three approaches. I like to challenge myself, so I click on the second one, about spectra. I already know what the Electromagnetic Spectrum is, but this one is a tad different. It tells you about the redshift equation, which I already know about, and I've used it a few times in examples I made for myself, but I am confused about the next page (to get there, click the button at the bottom that says "Use This Technique to Solve for M31's velocity"), and the next page is worded in a way that I can't really understand it, and using the clues I get from the Spectrum Graph, I can't figure out what the answer is. What is Relative intensity of light, and what does the Calcium have to do with it? Also, isn't their value for the speed of light inaccurate, as far as I know, it's $3\times 10^8$, not $3\times 10^5$. Even further on, they want you to calculate the radial velocity from the graph, which I have no idea how to do.
If an answer about this here is acceptable, please give me a feasibly worded explanation of all this madness, and thanks in advance!
