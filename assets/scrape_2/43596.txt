Virial ratio behaviour

I think I didn't understand something about virial theorem for an $N$-body system, for instance the behaviour of virial ratio $T/\Omega$, with $T$ kinetic energy and $\Omega$ gravitational potential energy. As far as I understood, if the system is stationary, than virial ratio is $0.5$. This means on the other hand that the system is not expanding nor collapsing. But the behaviour of virial ratio is something like the plot in this question. Here the system starts from $T/\Omega < 0.5$, so it starts  collapsing and than reach a maximum. I would expect this maximum to be at $T/\Omega \sim 0.5$, since once the collapse stops the system is not accelerating nor decelerating, but it's about $0.75$. If the system is stationary at $0.5$ how can that maximum (and the next minimum too) be explained? I don't understand how virial ratio has a single value since it actually oscillates until converging to a specific value.
