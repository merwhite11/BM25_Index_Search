Which atom is a Neutron star made of?

I understood that everything was made of Atoms.

An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has
  the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and
  plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms

However with Neutron Stars;

the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars
  are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic
  particles

Does this mean neutrons can exist outside of an atom, and that a Neutron star isnâ€™t comprised of an element that is recognisable on the periodic table?
