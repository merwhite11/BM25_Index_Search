If NASA is going to capture an asteroid with a spacecraft, wouldn't a UFO be able to manuever a celestial body?

This article got me thinking If NASA is going to use our primitive space exploration technology to capture an asteroid wouldn't an Extra Terrestrial species have used UFO's to maneuver celestial bodies?
They clearly would have come across this problem along time ago and the videos of UFO's levitating and vectoring themselves demonstrates they operate on similar applied electromagnetic forces that the celestial bodies use to maneuver themselves around in solar systems.
Couldn't they maneuver meteors, asteroids, possibly even speed the advance of collisions developing protoplanets and move moons into orbits with planets?
Maybe they build solar systems to live in they way earthlings build housing developments?
