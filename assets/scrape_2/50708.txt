Age of Alpha Piscium B

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Piscium, the age of Piscium B is 331 Myr and   the Surface Gravity of 4.01 Â± 0.14  it cites the link :- https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/483/2/2300/5184501?login=false
When we view the table, https://academic.oup.com/view-large/127773013 , we see it says the SG is 4.01 and that the age of said star is 8.52 Gyr.
Therefore,
a) Wikipedia is wrong
b) 8.52 Gyr is not the age but represents something else and where in the document is 331 derived from?
c) I'm missing something
