When did the first cold dark matter halos begin to originate?

I know that these dark matter halos should have been created in an early universe because during the formation of galaxies, the baryonic matter was too hot to form gravitationally self-bound objects and should have required the cdm to form these structures. Did they form in an era dominated by non-relativistic matter or by radiation?
Thanks for your response.
