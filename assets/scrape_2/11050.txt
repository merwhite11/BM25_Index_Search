Age of the universe vs. its contents

A couple of decades ago I read an article (could have been either Astronomy, Space, or Science News) that suggested the contents of the universe may be older than the universe itself.  Of course, that result was so preposterous that it was summarily dismissed.  However, when I read that article, I thought it made sense.  Surely the universe is much more massive than its contents, so as General Relatively predicts, should experience time more slowly.  This conclusion seemed so obvious that a) a bunch of other folks much brighter than I would have thought of it, and b) therefore my conclusion is completely erroneous.  So my question is: why wouldn't the mass of the universe cause it to experience time at a rate slower than its contents as GR predicts?  (There are a couple of questions on SE that are similar, but I do not believe this is a duplicate.)
