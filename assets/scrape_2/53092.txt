Outer Limit of Oort Cloud

In most popular astronomy articles I see the Oort Cloud described as having a radius of about two light years. Is there any firm basis for this or is it merely a guess?
If it is that big, and Alpha Centauri has one of similar dimensions, then the two clouds  might well meet. And assuming the same holds good for other stars, is it meaningful to speak of any outer limit at all, or do the various Oort Clouds just extend until they reach the point where some other star has more gravitational influence?
