Do astronomers generally agree that the distinction between comets and asteroids is not so clear?

edit: I just saw this tweet and find it incredibly relevant :)



begin question: See this answer and then consider if there are known or likely solar system bodies that might be identified as both asteroids and comets.
If so (there seems to be an example there) would this be because there is insufficient information known about the body, and the ambiguity could be cleared up with enough data (say a visit by a spacecraft)?  Or are the categories of asteroids and comets actually overlapping?
If the latter, is there work underway to improve or update these definitions?
