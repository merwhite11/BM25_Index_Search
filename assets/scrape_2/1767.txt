Did atoms in human body indeed come from stars?

I think I am not alone who saw videos about that we (humans) are made of same atoms which someday were in stars. In other words, some atoms in our bodies are from stars which exploded billions of years ago.
I wonder if it is indeed true. I mean human's life begins when sperm cell fertilize egg cell. Now does that sperm cell or egg cell indeed contains some of the exact atoms from those stars? 
I know little bit strange question, but would be interesting to hear if it is indeed true, that atoms in our body are same which someday were in stars.
In case you are wondering that's the video I am talking about: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D05ej8u-gU
