Centre (projected) of a galaxy cluster

A galaxy cluster consists of somewhere around a few tens to several hundred galaxies. 
To measure the position of a galaxy cluster, i.e. it's RA and DEC, do astronomers always assume it to be its Brightest Cluster Galaxy BCG's position?
It has been shown by Johnston et al. 2007 that BCGs are not always found in the centre of a cluster/halo. If so, does the assumption of taking the position of a BCG to be the position of the galaxy cluster still hold true?
