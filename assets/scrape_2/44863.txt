Could it be that Universe is rotating while expanding?

I have read that the measurements of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the Universe has a flat geometry on large scales.
Could one assume then that the Universe is acceleratingly rotating around some axis and that the centrifugal force of this rotation produces Universe's accelerated expansion and could this suggestion possibly eliminate the need for introducing the concept of dark energy, which was suggested/hypothesized mostly to accommodate/explain accelerated Universe expansion, observable by spectral red shift of far away Galaxies.
