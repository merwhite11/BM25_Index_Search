How big would the Milky Way be if all the stars were emptied into one sphere?

Neglecting the fact that this ball of gas would just collapse on itself - I'm curious if there's an agreed-upon measurement that takes into account the volume of all the ~100 billion stars to predict the diameter of a milky way where all the gas is in one orb. If not, is it safe to just use the volume of our Sun (which is an "average" star) and multiply by 100 billion or is there a more accurate data set to include in the calculation?
