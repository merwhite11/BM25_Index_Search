How is it possible that a universe with mass does not have curvature?

I may know the answer to my question. Mass must curve the universe but the pressure due to energy density may curve the universe in the opposite direction, leading to a flat universe, if they exactly cancel. But this leads to a supplementary question.
It seems to me that in a universe with positive curvature, gravity is a force encouraging the contraction of the universe while the pressure due to the density of energy is a force encouraging the expansion of the universe. But in a universe with negative curvature, the opposite should apply. Gravity should encourage the expansion of the universe while pressure should encourage its contraction. And in a flat universe neither gravity nor pressure should have any effect on the expansion of the universe. So if our universe is flat, dark energy can not be encouraging accelerating expansion. Any thoughts?
