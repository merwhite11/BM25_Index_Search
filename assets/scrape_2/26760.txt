collimating AstroMaster 114

I've owned my AstroMaster 114EQ for about a year now, and feel like I know my way around pretty well, but I'm only just becoming aware that collimation is recommended. The user manual has instructions on basic collimation. Does this look sufficient? Or should I invest in a celestron 94183 collimation cap, a celestron collimation eyepiece, or something fancy like an Orion LaserMate Deluxe II? The telescope itself cost less than $200 so I can't help but wonder if the fancier collimators are overkill. I've watched this longish video and one must apparently perform some disassembly on the telescope to user the laser collimator. This doesn't seem like the easy 'couple of minutes' adjustment I've seen described.
I'm also confused about the process of adjusting the secondary mirror. If anyone has good instructions about my specific model, I would greatly appreciate it. I'd really like to get it tuned up now that Mars is looking so good.
