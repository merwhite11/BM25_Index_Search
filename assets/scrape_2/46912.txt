What can be the minimum time for a somewhat stable twin star orbit to collapse on being affected by a third body?

The third 'invading' celestial body passing by or crashing into one of the stars could be a possible reason for the orbit collapse. Something that throws the stars* off-course speeding up their death dance. Is an orphaned/rogue planet capable of this? If so how long would it take? If I were to consider extreme events, how 'fast' can this process occur?**
*Main Sequence stars
**Say from the moment the third body starts to affect the system significantly till the first collision of the main bodies of the stars.
I hope this question is not off-topic. This is my first time asking on this site.
