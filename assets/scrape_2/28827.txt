Could a distant black hole (detected due to its mass) be in reality a Dyson sphere?

When the black hole is only detected due to its gravitational effects on other stars and their light, could it be possible that it is in reality a working Dyson sphere?
It would still have at least the mass of the star but also blocks all the emitting light.
I got the idea from watching this Kurzgesagt video about Dyson spheres
