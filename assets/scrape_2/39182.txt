How do different formulas for calculating the mean anomaly of an elliptic orbit correlate?

I need to calculate the mean anomaly of an elliptic orbit at a specific point in time. I found two different formulas for $M(t)$ and I'd like to know how they correlate and if they result in different ouputs.
The first formular is:
$M(t) = \frac{2 \: \pi}{T}\:(t-t_o)$
and its taken from this book.
The second formular is:
$M(t) = M_0 + \Delta t \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^3}}$
taken from this document.
Inputs:
$T$... Orbital Period
$t_o$... Starting point in time (epoch)
$t$... Point in time
$\Delta t$... Elasped time: $t-t_0$
$\mu$... Standard gravitational parameter $\mu=GM$
$a$... Semi-major axis
$M_0$... Mean anomaly at epoch
