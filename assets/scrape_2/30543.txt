Why hasn't the Earth fallen into the sun yet?

So the Earth's been orbiting the sun in a relatively stable orbit for billions of years now. during that time, it's been plowing through dust, and hit by comets and asteroids, presumably mostly from the outer reaches more than the inner parts of the solar system.
Even if the drag and increased mass should amount to a tiny, tiny fraction of Earth's mass, shouldn't that have been enough to cause our orbit to spiral inwards? Both due to slowing of the Earth's motion, and an increase in mass?
Thanks!
