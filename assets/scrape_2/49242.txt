The plane of revolution of planets around the Sun, and that of the solar system around the center of Milky way

We claim to have understood much about our galaxy without going beyond even our solar system - which is just a small portion in one of the arms of the galaxy. I assume that the plane in which planets move around the sun (the Eliptic) is also in the same plane in which all other arms of our galaxy rotate about its's center. Would our understanding about our galaxy different, if the two ecliptics would have intersected each other at some major angle?
