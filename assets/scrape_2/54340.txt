Could sky islands exist on exoplanets or moons?

Sky Islands are a popular sci-fi trope. Think the Avatar films, the Legend of Zelda Nintendo switch games and so on.
Is there any configuration of exoplanets or moons that could sustain a large body of land visibly near a planet? Given some exoplanets could have the same density as styrofoam, and others are believed to be in complex gravitational systems with binary stars and other planets, moons etc. Is there any configuration that could work?
