Is it thought that the majority of Earth size or larger terrrestrial planets have retained most of their original atmospheres?

I used to think that most terrestrial planet atmospheres were secondary (from out gassing). However, after reading this https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140017487.pdf and noticing that the ratio of CO2 to N2 is far higher on Venus than that just expected from out gassing, I have done a 180.
I'm thinking that Earth has a primarily secondary atmosphere because of the Moon creating event and smaller planets like Mars just aren't massive enough to retain original nitrogen, etc.
Would this cast a shadow on the idea of early extreme stellar activity ripping off atmospheres of close in planets?
