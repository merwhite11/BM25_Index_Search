$v_{GW}$ near a binary star?

In empty space, at large distances from masses and at small amplitudes, GWs propagate at the speed of light. This does not apply near the source, because there is a large mass and the amplitude of the GW is very large. How large is $v_{GW}$ at a distance of 1 AU from Algol? There, two suns orbit each other within 2.87 days.
