Can a photon have a stable orbit around a black hole?

Can a black hole free from an accretion disk collect photons in the photon sphere in a prolonged stable orbit?
Could enough photons be in orbit to shade the actual black hole with light?
Would a rogue black hole appear to have an atmosphere made of photons from the light emitted from other distant stars entrapped and released?
