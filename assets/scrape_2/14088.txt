Could dark matter assist with star formation?

This is related to the question: "Can dark matter decrease the Jeans length?" If dark matter assists in any way with star formation, shouldn't it be detectable by precisely measuring velocities in young open clusters? In particular, could the motions of stars in the Pleiades all be explained without the presence of dark matter?
