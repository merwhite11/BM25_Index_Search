How much competition there is for jobs in astronomy compared to other fields of science?

I will soon finish a master's degree in computer science. I have been interested in astronomy for some time, which has included playing around with a Newtonian reflector telescope and reading about CCD-cameras.
I checked some local universities, and was amazed that they have only 10 or so graduates each year (1-2 get a PhD and the rest a master's degree). How many jobs are there for these graduates? Compared to other fields, how tough is the competition in astronomy? Is it different for some relatively new areas, e.g. space neuroscience or astrobiology?
I am considering to apply for an astronomy PhD, so any input would be helpful.
