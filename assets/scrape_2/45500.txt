Is a black hole's gravity strongest at its event horizon or at least near it?

I know black holes are extraordinarily powerful when it comes to the gravitational pull.
But I wanted to get something clarified - is the gravity stronger at the event horizon (like, on the very edge of it), or near the event horizon?
Because it kind of seems baffling that gravity can still be at play at the event horizon, when there's nothing there. Plus, I keep saying that gravity is stronger near the event horizon, and I wanted to make sure I was right. Thanks.
