Is the Sun really a medium size star?

It is often said that the Sun is a medium size, or even dim star. Is this true?
According to this list of stars within 21 light years, there are, out of the closest 121 stars, only six brighter than the Sun. This means that the Sun is in the top 6%. If you also count brown dwarfs, the Sun ranks even higher. 
Doesn't this indicate that the Sun is actually a relatively large star?
