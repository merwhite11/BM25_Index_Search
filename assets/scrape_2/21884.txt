Why shouldn't you look at the Sun through a camera using eclipse glasses?

One of the NASA approved eclipse glasses manufacturers has the following warning on one of their eclipse glasses:

Do NOT look through a camera, telescope or binoculars with ANY eclipse shades on!

I can see how the enlarged image of the Sun through a telescope or binoculars might overwhelm the eclipse glasses' filters.
But how would looking at the Sun using a camera's viewfinder or LCD screen reduce the effectiveness of eclipse glasses (assuming you're not using any zoom function)?
