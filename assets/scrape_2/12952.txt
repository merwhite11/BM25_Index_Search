Why does it make sense to say the universe has no centre?

If we suppose we and everything in the universe is perfectly flat.  That is, we have width and depth, but no height.  And we are situated on the surface of a balloon blowing up with air and expanding "outwards".  Us flat people can move around on the surface of our balloon but not through it, in much the same way we navigate around the earth, in a plane say. No matter where something is situated on the surface of the balloon, one point is no more central than any other point.  In other words, the surface of a balloon (the "universe") has no centre.  Is this why we say it makes no sense to say the universe has a centre, or edge for that matter, or is this analogy stupid?
