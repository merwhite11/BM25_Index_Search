Did anyone else see this in the sky Thursday Feb 9 about 18:50 PST?

My location is Cottage Grove Oregon, and last night in the sky just south of directly overhead I saw an absolutely straight line of moving lights, each light passing my eye at 3 second intervals, going from West to East. There was one break in the sequence, involving a 6 second delay.
Seventeen lights were visible at any one time, each a small disc reflecting the sun and about the apparent size of artificial satellites, though they gave the impression of being much further away than such satellites.
I did not see the start of this phenomenon, but watched until it came to an end, some 3 to 5 minutes, so I saw 60 to 100 of these things pass overhead. My immediate thought was that I was watching the alien starship fleet flyby, and expected the news media to be full of it this morning, but nothing.
Did anyone else see them?
