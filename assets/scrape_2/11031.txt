What is the force of a CME on objects in space?

I've been reading a little bit about coronal mass ejections lately and they seem really interesting, and they cause a lot of amazing things to happen. However, one thing I haven't seen is the physical force they can have on objects. CMEs seem to have a lot of mass and they're moving at a high rate of speed so I imagine they must have some effect on objects in space, right? What kind of effect can they have on smaller objects like meteoroids, comets, or satellites (as far as orbit, rotation, anything else)?
