Speed of light in cosmic voids

If temperature affects the speed of light (a contentious issue, I gather) then is it possible that the speed of light outside our solar system or galaxy, which might be minimally warmer than the cosmic void, is infinitesimally slower? Such an effect would only been seen in great astronomical distances, but I don't know how it could be measured.
