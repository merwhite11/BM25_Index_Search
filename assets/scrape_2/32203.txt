What would you find within a void?

I'm aware that voids are relatively empty regions of the universe, but just how empty can they be? Wikipedia states that voids have 'few or no' galaxies, but I can't find much else.
To make my question specific, suppose I were in the centre of a large void, way outside of the few galaxies that may still exist in this void. Would I occasionally encounter asteroids (if I may call them such), rogue planets, or even some occasional intergalactic star?
Remark: I'm aware that this question is a bit of a one-up of What is there in the intergalactic space?. If this is too much of a duplicate, let me know and I remove the question.
