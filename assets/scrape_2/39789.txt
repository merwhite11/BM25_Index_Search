Salary of observatory worker?

I am thinking of becoming an astronomer becuase I love looking through my telescope at night, and may want to make it my profession. Is there money to be made working at an observatory, or is the BLS median annual wage of $114,590 primarily from other career paths within astronomy? How hard is it to get a job at an observatory?
