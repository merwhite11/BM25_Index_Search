How does solar activity (e.g. flares, coronal mass ejections) change over the life cycle of a Sun-like star?

As a Sun-like star is born from a collapsed nebula and generates energy by nuclear fusion some of that energy is converted to magnetic fields which fuel solar activity. How does that activity evolve as the star itself evolves?
