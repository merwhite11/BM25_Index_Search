Aren't denser bodies more likely to collapse into hydrostatic equilibrium?

It is said that at small sizes, icy planets are more likely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium than terrestrial rocky ones. But why, as a matter of fact? Shouldn't denser bodies be more likely to collapse into equilibrium (I'm talking of equilibrium achieved by self-gravity only) and be more able to remain in that state?
