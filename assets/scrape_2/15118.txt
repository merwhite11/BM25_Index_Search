Was the radiant of the Perseid meteor shower ever near Vega thousands of years ago?

The ancient Chinese story of the Weaver Girl (Altair) and the Cowherd (Vega) tell of starcrossed lovers who are only allowed to meet once a year on the 7th day of the 7th (Chinese) lunar month, roughly around early August, when magpies form a bridge across the silver river (the Milky Way.) This is celebrated in the Qixi festival in China (August 9th in 2016.)
Because of the timing, I'm suspicious that the magpies represent the Perseid meteor shower (August 12th in 2016.)  But I just got my first planisphere, and Altair and Vega are pretty far away from Perseus (although Perseus is still on the Milky Way.)  The Wiki article and others that I've looked into on Weaver Girl and Cowherd does not connect the magpies to any meteor shower.
But the Weaver Girl and Cowherd story is pretty old - up to 2600 years according to Wikipedia.  I don't think the Perseids have always been in Perseus due to the precession of the equinox, but 2600 years ago maybe the "Perseid" shower was closer to the southern triangle, or is that too far away to be explained only by precession of the equinox?
I'm very new to astronomy and I'm not Chinese, but I love this story and I'm looking for more information.
Thanks!
