What are the main ways that pulsar "glitches" are noticed and documented? Do they have to be caught in the act of glitching to be catalogued?

This answer to Is there any well-populated list or database of pulsar "glitches"? mentions two large databases; (Jodrell Bank and ATNF's pulsar catalog) but neither question nor answer defines what is or isn't considered a glitch proper nor touches on how they are detected.
Question(s):

What are the main ways that pulsar "glitches" are noticed and documented? Is it always radio telescope observations or are X-ray pulsars included and measured via periodic X-ray emission? Or even optical pulsing?
Do they have to be caught in the act of glitching to be catalogued, or for example is it enough to note that there's been a change in phase and/or frequency at some point between two periods of measurement?
