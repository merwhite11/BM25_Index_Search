Precision in the measurement of the distance to the Sun

How precisely can the distance to the Sun be measured? Wikipedia says the distance to the Moon can be measured upto millimeter precision. But Wikipedia article on distance to the Sun says only about Astronomical Unit and nothing on the precision of the measurement of the distance to the Sun. I am certainly aware that we now use radar to measure the distance to the Sun, and I remember reading the precision in its measurement somewhere on the Internet, but I can't find it anymore. When I try to find the relevant information on the Internet, all I find is educational articles on things such as parallax, which is certainly superceded by radar measurements, or articles on lunar distance, which I am not looking for. Relevant references will highly be appreciated.
Edit: I just found out on Internet that we measure the distance to the Sun through distance to the Venus or Mercury. Anyway I want to know the precisions or errors in these measurements..
