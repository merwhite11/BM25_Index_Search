What is the longitude (value) of the sub solar point of the vernal equinox?

I am new to this topic so correct me if I am wrong. But as I understand it, the vernal equinox point is a point on the celestial sphere where the ecliptic and celestial equator meets. When the sun's sub-solar point is directly falling on this point that moment in time is the vernal equinox. So, if we take a projection of it on earth, this point has to resolve to a particular latitude and longitude.
I know the latitude is 0°, but what is the longitude for this point? I am assuming that it's definitely not the 0° lat, 0° long.
Note: I know that this point can be slowly moving away to right or left due to Earth's precession. I would like to know where this point is atleast for this year.
