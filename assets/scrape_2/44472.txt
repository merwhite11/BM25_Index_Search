I am getting triple image of the moon from a 50mm telescope

I just bought a telescope and saw the moon but with the bright moon at the center there are two faint images of the moon above and below it. I figured out it was due to the periscope mirror. If I see my finger through that periscope it has a faint outline around it. Which is getting magnified when I try to look the moon.then I tried to see my finger from a normal mirror diagonally and I first time noticed that every mirror does the same , there is a faint outline around my finger if I see it diagonally through a mirror. So my question is, how do I fix it now?
