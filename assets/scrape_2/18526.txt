How easy would be to see the Moon from Mars?

This question arises from "What planet is better than earth to infer solar system configuration?", where one of the answers pointed that it's easier to discover the Moon from Mars than discovering the Galilean satellites of Jupiter from Earth.
Then my question is:

How easy (or difficult) would be to see the Moon from Mars?
Could it be seen with naked eye?
Is actually easier to see the Moon from Mars than to see the Galilean moons of Jupiter from Earth?

I know there are favourable factors (Mars is closer to Earth than Earth to Jupiter, and Earth is smaller than Jupiter, so it's expected to obscure less its moon than Jupiter obscures its) and also unfavourable factors (the Moon is closer to the Earth than the Galilean moons to Jupiter, and Earth and Moon are backlit when seen from Mars). What is the overall result?
