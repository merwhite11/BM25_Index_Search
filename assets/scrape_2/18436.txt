Did we discover how nebulae hold their shapes?

As you know, nebulae such as the Eagle Nebula, the Cat's Eye Nebula, and the Pillars of Creation, have extraordinary shapes.  But have we discovered why that is so?  I've tried researching it myself however all that comes up are theories of a magnetic field, etc.
