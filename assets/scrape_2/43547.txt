Chances of life on other planets, how watertight is the idea that 'As soon as life could occur, it did occur’?

I’ve heard it reasoned that ‘Almost as soon as life could occur on Earth, it did. Therefore it seems likely that life develops easily, and thus that there’s probably lots of life out there’.
Is this notion undermined by any of these things?:
– If life develops easily, it’s likely to have developed independently multiple times on Earth (any evidence of this?).
– The fact that life developed soon after particular conditions emerged indicates only that that’s what happened on that occasion. It doesn’t indicate frequency. It might occur once every trillion years under those circumstances.
– Life could happen under many circumstances that life as we know it doesn’t exist. If there’s no evidence it did on Earth under different conditions, how does the reasoning hold?
