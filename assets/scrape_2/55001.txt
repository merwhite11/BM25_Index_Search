How was this image of the faculae in the Occator crater obtained?

The picture in question (that I'm asking about) is at the bottom, of this post. Now, did they simply take a picture with reduced light intake? If so how much? 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 or less? Or did they digitally process an already existing image somehow?

In the ordinary pictures (above) of Ceres with the Occator crater visible, the faculea are a total whiteout, so something must have been done to make details visible. The otherwise grey surface is obviously nearly black in the (bottom) picture.
