How does the Grand Tack Hypothesis explain how Jupiter formed inside the frost line?

The Grand Tack Hypothesis states that Jupiter formed at roughly 3.5 AU from the Sun, then interacted with a large portion of objects in the Solar System before settling into its current orbit.
Yet as I found from researching for an answer to this question, giant planets generally form beyond the frost line - in fact, this explains why the giant planets are cut off from the terrestrial planets.
How does the Grand Tack Hypothesis get around this?
