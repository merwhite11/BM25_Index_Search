Are chirped gravitational wave events generally first identified by searching through libraries of chirps?

Comments below What does "GPU-accelerated butterfly matched filtering over dense bank of time-symmetric chirp-like templates" mean? (GW170817) suggest that for this technique a library of strain "chirps" is built, then in real time a fast computer (in this case GPU-assisted) constantly compares the the most recent signals from a gravitational wave detecting interferometer to all of them, looking for matches above a chosen matching threshold.
As long as the matching rate is not too high, these can be passed on to more sophisticated analyses to better decide if a chirped gravitational wave event might have been detected, and if so, to start figuring out where it was so that alerts can be generated and other instruments (e.g. optical and X-ray telescopes) can start looking for a signature for a source.
Question: Are chirped gravitational wave events generally first identified by searching through libraries of chirps?
Is this how they are first identified in general, or does the paper cited in the linked question describe just one possible method, and library searches are not always a part of the process?
