Perception of an objects history passing as an observer moves toward it

If a star is 20 light-years away and I look at it through a telescope, what I'm observing is what the star was doing 20 years ago yes? So, if I fix my sight on the star and move toward it (for example's sake, let's say 0.5C or half the speed of light in a vacuum) in a linear path (which is not practical for real space travel) it would take me 40 years to reach it. By the time I reach it I would be observing in (almost) real-time what is happening. So to me that says that I've watched 60 years of the star's history in 40 years worth of time. So then, would it look to me as if I was watching a movie of the star's history in 1.5 times 'normal' speed? (60/40 = 3/2 or 1 1/2)
