The presence of maars on the Moon

Wondering if there's any evidence to date of the existence of maar craters on the Moon? If not, how probable is it that the moon ever supported the necessary conditions for maars to form?
A report prior to the Apollo 15 mission suggested that the Hadley C crater might be a maar (a depression produced by exploding steam when rising magma comes into contact with sub-surface water). No doubt the crater's location atop a volcanic feature - the Hadley sinuous rille - factored into its speculated non-impact genesis.
But why was this even considered a possibility at the time? I understand that water on the Moon may have come from a variety of sources, like hydrogen and oxygen reactions triggered by solar winds, water ions from Earth hitting the Moon and turning into permafrost etc. But could enough sub-surface water have accumulated in this way for a powerful enough crater-forming steam explosion to occur?
