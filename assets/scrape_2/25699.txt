creations after supernovas

Why is it the some massive stars go supernovae and than either form a black hole, pulsar or a magnetar. All stars essentially go through the same process when theyâ€™re alive and burning through their fuel. It almost looks as if stars create everything in the universe one way or another, is it too far-fetched to think that black holes (theortical), pulsars and magnetars to name a few, could be completely different objects? Like have we actually witnessed the creation of any of these objects??
