How can I observe the Orionid Meteor Shower?

I would like to see the orionids sometime this week (October 20-26, 2013). What is the best way for me to observe them by naked eye?
Also, would I be benefitted by trying to look at them with a telescope or or are they too fast and spontaneous for most amateurs to capture?
