Why is time referred to as "The" capital T 4th dimension?

Often you hear people say "time is The 4th dimension". What confuses me is that people talk about "The 4th" dimension as if it's a specific thing and I don't understand why.
What I mean by that, is that I can plot the position of a point in 3D space with the 4th dimension being just about anything. For instance, I can plot my position in space with time being the 4th dimension showing me my position at any given timepoint, but I can also plot my position in space with, say, my level of hunger being the 4th dimension where I'd be able to see where I was in space based on hungry I was.
What I'm trying to get at is, is there a reason why time is widely considered as THE 4th dimension rather than just another parameter? Is the "The" really describing an intrinsic relationship?
