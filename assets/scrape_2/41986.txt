How would the temperature on earth be if the sun was slightly more or less powerful?

The temperature on earth is around 14C celsius.
It is around 1370 W/m^2 from our sun. The earth has an albedo of around 0.3
On Tatooine (from Star Wars) i have been able to calculate it goes from 1066 W/m^2 to 2100 W/m^2 (depending if the stars eclipse each other or not). Tatooine is a desert planet with a albedo of around 0.4. How can i make a simplified function to calculate what the temperature ranges from on Tatooine?
I did read on effective temperature on wikipedia, but that is higher than the level in my physics class so i didnt understand.
In the movies they say the temperatures get quite cold at night and warm during the day, so i would expect it to go something like -10C to 40C.
We can just assume the atmosphere is the same as on earth since it is breathable for humans.
Considering as the albedo increases, the temperature should decrease with an increasing albedo.
Therefore my first attempt was
T=k(1-a)*P, where T is temp, k is a constant, a is albedo and P is w/m^2
Since the atmosphere is the same, k should be the same?
Therefore
287=k(1-0.3)*1370, solving for k gives us
k=0.3
therefore temperature on Tatooine should follow the function
f(x)=T=0.3*(1-0.4)*x-273 (to get it measured in celsius)
Where 1066<x<2100.
f(1066)=-81 and f(2100)=99
the temperature are not this extreme doe, so this wont work.
I am aware this is not an accurate science, but im taking my first physics course in high school now, so I dont understand the "proper" way of doing this. Is it completely incorrect to assume temperature is proportional to (1-a) and how much power the sun gives us, when its the same atmosphere (ish)?
If anyone wants how i found out the power the twin suns gives Tatooine i can share it here.
