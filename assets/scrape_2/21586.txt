Projecting an image of the sun / eclipse

This might be an astronomy.stackexchange.com question, but I think it is more in line with a camera obscura.
During the last eclipse I didn't plan ahead and grabbed some lousy toy "spy" telescope we had (about 2 inches long), set it up on a tripod and pointed it at a white foam board.
I'd like to plan ahead more this time.  
What can I use to project a decent image of the sun onto a foam board?  What kind of lens do I need?  Would a magnifying lens work?  How about a close-up diopter filter?  How about a 50mm lens?  (I'd like to use something I already have, or is cheap -- and I don't want to use a pin hole.)
My first thought was that a magnifying glass only focuses the sun down to a pin point (and would burn the board), but I'm recalling now that past that focal point you can project an image.
