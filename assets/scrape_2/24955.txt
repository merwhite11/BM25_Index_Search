Unidentified color changing object in sky

Yesterday, I was just star gazing and I noticed some star-like object moving with a high speed somewhere near the Orion's Belt and exhibiting all the seven colors i.e VIBGYOR and after a few moments, it disappeared. Any plausible explanations for this observation?
