Does dark energy make galaxies expand over long periods of time?

Does dark energy expand galaxies slightly over time?  I would think this could be verified easily (observe if galaxies far away / further in the past smaller and denser), and might make a good research topic!
I am specifically asking at the galaxy level here.  It is pretty clear dark energy acts at levels beyond a galaxy.
Edit: There have been similar questions pointed out, but I have not seen any asking specifically at the level of a galaxy.
Note: It would seem that if the galaxies used to be smaller, that might explain the increased star formation explained here:

"About 10 billion years ago, galaxies were more chaotic, with more supernovae, 10 times more star formation"
