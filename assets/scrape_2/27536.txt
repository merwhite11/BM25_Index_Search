Existence of wormholes and exotic matter

Is it really possible for bending of space time to travel to another distant place in universe. Wormhole has two mouths which one is a black hole and another is a white hole which could let us out. Which is commonly called as Einstein-Rosen bridge, is there any pictorial proof of wormholes other than the theoretical proof by Einstein. Is there a possibility of having exotic matter which helps the wormhole to keep open up always??
