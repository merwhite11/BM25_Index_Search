What observations will be done during the New Horizons flyby of Ultima Thule?

On New Year's Eve 2018, the New Horizons spacecraft will fly past Ultima Thule (2014 MU69) at about a third of the distance it flew by Pluto some years ago. So it should be able to get some detailed photographs, but the closing speed is rather high. What scientific observations will be done during the flyby? 
Is it a case of a couple of snaps, assuming the camera is pointed correctly? Or is there more that can be done? Any other instruments that will get useful data?
