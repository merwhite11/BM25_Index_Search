Do supernova remnant nebula re-collapse into a star?

We know that nebula sometimes collapse into stars. The particles are attracted to the joint gravitational center of the whole nebula.
One type of nebula is a supernova remnant nebula. Unlike a normal nebula, the particles are moving away from the center of the nebula... for a while...
But what is preventing these particles from being on a trajectory that results in them slowing down and eventually traveling inward toward the center of the nebula?
Is the environment the only significant factor? Would a rogue star not in a galaxy (in a void) that goes supernova eventually recover all of it's remnants?
