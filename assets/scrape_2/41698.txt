This article says the moon may start moving closer to the Earth in the distant future; could this be true?

Bruce Dorminey wrote an article for Forbes with the title of "Earth And Moon May Be On Long-Term Collision Course". The article notes:

"For now, our anomalously large Moon is spinning away from us at a
variable rate of 3.8 centimeters per year. But, in fact, the Earth and
Moon may be on a very long-term collision course --- one that
incredibly some 65 billion years from now, could result in a
catastrophic lunar inspiral."

It seems a little illogical that the Moon would suddenly start running toward earth at a far distance. Multiply 3.8 by 65 billion you get 2,470,000,000(May be innacurate). The article also notes this:

"As a result, the timing of the Moon’s ongoing recession is hard to
precisely predict. That’s because, as Barnes1 points out, the Earth
goes through glacial and interglacial cycles, causing the area of
shallow seas to change as sea level rises and falls."

Is it possible to understand how/why the author believes that the Moon could fall into a lunar inspiral? Please cite sources, thanks!
