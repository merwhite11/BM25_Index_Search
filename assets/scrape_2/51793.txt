Lifespan of higher mass red dwarf stars

Wikipedia and the reference paper they are using offer some insights into the lifespan of smaller red dwarf stars (link). However it offers no insight as to what the projected lifespan of larger red dwarf stars is, i.e. red dwarfs between 0.25 and 0.6 solar masses. How are long are red dwarf stars such as TOI-700 which is 0.41 solar masses project to life?
