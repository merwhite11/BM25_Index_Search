Is an ice planet made only by Ice?

Is an ice planet made only by ice? 
What causes the water to conglomerate and form ice in a planet?
Even if the planet is not made entirely by ice but has an high % of ice (e.g. 50% ice), how can it be explained?
I heard about ice planets with surface temperature way above the melting point.
Can it be explained with surface pressure?
Edit: This is probably wrong but feel free to point it out in a full answer
Thanks.
