Would a Jovian calendar be based on the Jovian sidereal year or tropical year?

According to many places online, Jupiter's tiny axial tilt makes it have no seasons, and its huge size eliminates any variance possible due to its orbital eccentricity. All these considered, what would a Jovian calendar be based on - the Jovian tropical year or the Jovian sidereal year? After all, the tropical year's used when you have seasons to keep up with, and as most places say, Jupiter doesn't have any.
