If we lived in a multiverse, what would our universe most likely then be named?

We live in the Milky Way Galaxy, but we don't just call it "The Galaxy", because we know there are multiple different galaxies. So if we lived in a multiverse, it wouldn't make much sense to keep calling our universe "The Universe".
How are names for things like this created, and what would a likely name for our universe be?
