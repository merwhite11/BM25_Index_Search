Would a high albedo reflective substance cool down Venus?

If we were to put a highly reflective substance into Venus's upper atmosphere, could we cool it down?  I am envisioning adding a highly reflective fine dust or gas, possibly lighter than "air" to the atmosphere.  I believe to have the proper effect, it should also reflect infrared light, which causes heat.  Apparently Venus already has a high albedo of .75 (reflects 75% of light): http://www.universetoday.com/36833/albedo-of-venus/ .  However, if we were able to raise that higher, even up to 99%, would that cool it down, perhaps even making it habitable (temperature wise), or possibly even making it ice cold?
