Question about Cowell's method

According to Wikipedia:
“ ... for $n$ mutually interacting bodies, Newtonian forces on body $i$ from the other bodies $j$ are” given by the summation equation$$\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{n}\frac{Gm_{j}\left(\mathbf{r}_{j}-\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)}{r_{ij}^{3}},$$
“with all vectors being referred to the barycenter of the system.”
The summed over accelerations denoted by the right side of this equation do not appear to take into account gravitational forces between the $j$ other bodies? In other words, all the accelerations are functions of $\mathbf{r}_{i}$, the position vector of the body acted on by the $j$ other bodies. Is that interpretation correct?
EDIT
So if, for example, I wanted to calculate the Earth's acceleration due to the effect of the Sun and Jupiter, I would use the equation three times. Once with $i$ representing Earth to find the Earth's acceleration; once with $i$ representing the Sun to find the Sun's acceleration; and once with $i$ representing Jupiter to find Jupiter's acceleration. If I knew the initial position and velocity of the three bodies I could then numerically integrate these three equations to find positions and velocities after a certain time. Is that right?
