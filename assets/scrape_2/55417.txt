Red supergiants with luminosities significantly above the Humphreys-Davidson limit?

The M33 red supergiants (RSDs) LGGS J013312.26+310053.3 and LGGS    J013339.28+303118.8 both have luminosities significantly above the Humphreys-Davidson (HD) limit (logL 5.76 and 5.68 [source], current research puts the RSG luminosity limit at around 5.5). Even the most luminous cool supergiants like Stephenson 2 DFK 49 and HD 269551 A have much lower luminosities (logL is around 5.59 for both [source] [source]). So how are those two stars this luminous? They probably aren't foreground stars.
