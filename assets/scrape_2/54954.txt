Can telescopes under $200 help you see saturn clearly by eye without editing the image on a computer?

I had a telescope that only cost 50 dollars  for viewing the moon and it was good for that but the planet's were always badly out of focus. I am thinking of getting a better telescope for up to $200 but reviews on YouTube of these telescopes  usually say they are good but after taking videos and superimposing the best frames on one another.  Can a cheap telescope give clear views of Saturn or Jupiter without the need for making videos or taking photos?
