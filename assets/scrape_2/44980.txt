What are Euclidean-normalized differential source counts?

I would like to know what the Euclidean-normalized and differential source counts mean in "Euclidean-normalized differential source counts".
It would be great to hear a) a clear definition and b) an explanation on university student level.
The term is used in many papers. For instance, in the abstract of Grant et al. 2010:
The DRAO Planck Deep Fields: The Polarization Properties of Radio Galaxies at 1.4 GHz
