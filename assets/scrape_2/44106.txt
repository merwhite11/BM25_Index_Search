Could Enceladus be too salty to support life?

The process of osmosis makes it possible for water to be sucked through a semi-permeable membrane in order to balance the concentrations of two solutions. Thus, a sufficiently salty ocean might drain all the water out of possible organisms; for instance, in the so-called Dead Sea only tiny micro-organisms are able to survive.
Since they've discovered salt on Enceladus, could this prevent this moon from hosting life, or at least certain types of life?
