Can illumination in the sky due to moonlight measured in any way?

Is illumination in the sky due to moonlight measured in any way? I'm trying to understand if I can make a model to understand at what level of illumination a person can clearly identify another person in a 1-meter range if six people with a similar physical characteristics are standing in a line.
Why am I doing this?
A friend of mine is being falsy accused of a crime. A woman is saying that she saw my friend at a place in the moonlight during a crime. In reality, he was with me that day at that time, and there is no way he was at the crime scene 50 miles away. I want to help him and his advocate with science. The date is February 16th, 2020.
