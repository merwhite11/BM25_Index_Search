How can the observable universe be so small if there are so many stars in it?

The observable universe has a radius of about 46.5 billion light years. That’s big but I just wonder how that can be big enough to fit in everything we know exists in the universe. There are hundreds of billions of galaxies and each galaxy has billions of stars. 
Plus there are vast spaces between galaxies. And galaxies tend to cluster up into local groups, so there would be even bigger gulfs of empty space between these local groups.
If the observable universe was only 46.8 billion light years, and there were this many and galaxies stars that need to fit inside, wouldn’t everything be much closer together?
