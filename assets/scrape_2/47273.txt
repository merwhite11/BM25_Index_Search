Star cluster next to Venus

Recently Observed Venus with my 6.3 inch Telescope with 401x magnification and got super crisp images, but just beside the Venus I found a relatively dim and somewhat large star Cluster (couldn't tell the Venus actually affected the image with its light). Now what actually is the Cluster? Location - Chennai, India. Time of observation- 19:00
