Light that travels eternally because of inflation?

What happens with electromagentic waves that are emitted into 
intergalactic space, but reach not any object because of inflation? Lets assume that photon A and photon B are emitted. Photon B hits some object, photon A enters a gigantic void or simply has nothing in its path, and heads for the horizon, so to say.
Relativity tells that A and B do not "feel" time passing. From our point of view B travels a finite time, while in the frame of B the object is reached instantly. However, since A will be eternally underway, what is going to happen? We have kind of a zero*infinity travelling time in the frame of A.
Do our models make statements about this? Or is there some explanation
