Lightning in Jupiter's "string of pearls?"

Is there any reason there couldn't be lightning in the storms that make up Jupiter's "string of pearls?"
Addendum:I'm writing a science fiction novel, with a ship passing by Jupiter and lightning is seen in one of those storms. I don't want to be in the position where someone says, "No way, there wouldn't be lightning in one of those storms."
