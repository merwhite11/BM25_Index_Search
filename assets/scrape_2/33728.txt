Does Gravitational Time Dilation stack on top of Time Dilation caused by Velocity?

Using 1 CM from the Event Horizon of Super Massive Black Hole, SGR A, as the reference point. The particles within the accretion disk are traveling at extreme high speeds.  Assume this speed increases as the particles orbit closer and closer to the EH. 
Are the particles within the accretion disk of Super Massive BH SGR A subject to time dilation both from 1) the gravitational field of SGR A at 1 cm from Event Horizon ...and 2) from the the acceleration of the particles traveling around the BH as they approach the EH?   
Does the acceleration of particles act as an interference to the affects of the gravitational time dilation?  And if not, or if these two types of time dilation affect the time intervals for this group of particles,  When would an observer 1 light year from the EH see the particles enter the EH?  A) Before Impacting the EH, B) After impacting the EH,  or C) Never?
