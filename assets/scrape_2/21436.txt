How strong would gravity need to be to prevent star formation

This question got me thinking.
In another universe, with a different value for the gravitational constant G, how much bigger would G need to be for star formation to be prevented?
In other words in a hypothetical universe, the star would attempt to ignite, but the force of gravity would overwhelm the star's outward pressure and you would just get a black hole instead.
I'm not looking for a precise answer here... just ROM... 10 times bigger? 10,000 times bigger?
