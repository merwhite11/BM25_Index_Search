Can planetary rings form as a result of solidifed lava thrown up by volcanoes on the surface of small rocky moons/planets?

I have heard that a moon in our solar system orbiting Saturn possesses geographical features that essentially spit out water and moisture from 'volcanoes' on its surface. The volume of water outputted thus far is such that it comprises a faint ring of Saturn
Would it be possible for a rocky planet orbiting their Sun/gas giant to have the right combination of volcanic activity and low-gravity such that magma thrown up by the volcanoes ends up in orbit of the small planet, cooling over time to form rings?
It seems to have happened with that specific moon of Saturn, with water, and rings formed around Saturn instead of the moon itself? Can it be possible with cooled-down lava?
