Why is it assumed that the universe started out with a size equal to the Planck length?

What if the Planck length is the distance between particles when the universe was very small .
For a spherical ball of 10^ 78 protons that would give the universe a radius of 10^26 X 10^-35 = 10^-9 metres  Is there a reason why this can't be the case? Does the CMB temperature forbid it?
