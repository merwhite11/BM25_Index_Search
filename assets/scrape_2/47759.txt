How can photoionization release photons? As in the coronal emission of a nova star?

The photoionization process absorbs energy (light), it doesn't release it....
So how can some astrophysicists say that photoionization releases the light responsible for the coronal emission of a star going nova?
Are some atoms being immediately recombine with their loose electrons?  Thereby releasing the near-infrared light?
