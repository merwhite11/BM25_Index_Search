Are magnetic vortices capable of providing magnetic lensing when observed away from the poles

Magnetic vortices-(ESA cluster mission from observations November 2018)(article, ESA, science & exploration: 'Magnetic Vortices explain mysterious auroral beads'. An observer during Saturn's recent opposition looks to the sky and notices auroral beads in what appears as a line of progression across the night sky. The progression appears as black spheres and white spheres or beads. Could the vortices be looked through as a lens?
