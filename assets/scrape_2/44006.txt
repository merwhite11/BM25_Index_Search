Is it dangerous to look at an L-type brown dwarf from too close?

Are some L-type brown dwarves bright enough so that it would be dangerous to the eyes if one looked at them from habitable distance or closer? If not, are the weakest M-type stars undangerous to look at from habitable distance too? T-type brown dwarves are dim enough that there shouldn't be any danger, and Y-type ones are invisible.
