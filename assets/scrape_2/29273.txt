I need help getting mars to look like a circle

I am having a lot of trouble getting a sharp image in my telescope. It is a skywatcher with a focal length of 1200mm and a diameter of 254mm. I have a laser colimater that I got for Christmas, so I have been using that but when I try to look at mars I see three mars in an overlapping triangle. I am not sure what to do. I have made sure that the laser is straight by 1. spinning it in the eyepiece holder and the laser stayed in the same spot 2. zooming in and out and again the laser stayed in the same place. the laser seems to be centered so I put it in the middle of the doughnut on the mirror and the laser bounces back into the middle of the colimating lens, but when I look at mars there is still three and there is no detail its just a red fuzz ball. I also checked the collimation of the telescope by zooming all the  way out to see where the shadow was and it seemed to be right in the middle.hopefully this makes sense, but let me know if I should say something in a different way. thank you In advance.
