How can a Grade-11 Student avail TESS data and learn to process?

As mentioned, I am a Grade-11 student. I have always been interested in Data Processing activities. This sums up my experience of working on Asteroid hunt Campaign under IASC (International Asteroid Search Campaign). I yielded more than 22 Preliminary discoveries at once. Now I wish, to hunt for KBO (Kuiper belt objects) and Exoplanets. Definitely, hunting exoplanets is not a kids' task, but I possess the ability to learn and process and render astronomical data under guidance! I am ready to do everything. I am more inclined towards searching Outer-Worlds than the inner objects! Mentor-ship in this regard will be gratefully appreciated. I have searched quite a few things but none helped. I'm a Zooniverse user too. And over there, project slots were filled by other Citizen-Scientists!
