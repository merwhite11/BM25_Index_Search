Dotted line of moving objects observed on May 5th and May 12th

I saw a dotted line shooting star-like object May 5th and May 12th. It was longer than any meteor/shooting star tail or trail I've ever seen before.  I mean longer in every way, the distance it traveled across the sky, the length of the dotted line and the amount of time I could see it.  I remember somebody from the UK asked the same question 9 months ago..
