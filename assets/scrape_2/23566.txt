Device used to measure stellar radii

I remember seeing in a video an instrument that was used to measure a star's radius with nothing more than the light it emitted. 
The device worked by opening or closing its mechanism in increments, while watching a display. The display started out showing some shape, maybe some lines or a circle, with blurriness. The closest you could get to making the shape blurry-less would determine the instrument's approximation of the star's radius. 
My question is, what is the name of this instrument?
