When did the first liquid water settle on planets?


PRELIMINARY

Water is necessary for supporting "life", at least the particular form of life as we know. The origin of Earth's water is still debated, but there are clues that most of it was delivered, later after the creation of Earth Wiki. It is now established that other planets in our solar system harbor water, in at least one of its three states (solid, liquid, vapor). So, Earth may not be the first planet in the solar system to have liquid water. Comparing the age of the Sun to the age of the Universe, there is strong suspicion that liquid water may existed on exoplanets long before the Sun was formed.

QUESTION:

I'm  curious as to: in which time frame the very first planets with liquid water were likely to have existed, and how this is scientifically established/hypothesized/modelized?
Subsidiary: What is the odd for an exo-planet to harbour water in all 3 forms, like on Earth?
