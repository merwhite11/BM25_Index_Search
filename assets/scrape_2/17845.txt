Difference between "planetary ring" and "circumstellar disk"?


Related: Do/Can Ringed Stars Exist?

Is there any particular difference, in behavior or properties, between a planetary ring system and a circumstellar disk? Or is the only real difference a matter of what's in the middle?
This question came up as a matter in the related discussion, particularly because the (game-simulated) object that inspired the question is a brown dwarf - something between a star and a gas giant. What I observed in-game appeared to be more similar to the rings around Saturn, than to the description and image provided of a circumstellar disk.
So, are there properties of the rings/disks themselves which can differentiate one type from another? Or is the type of central body the only thing that defines them?
If the central body is the only factor, what should we call a ring around a brown dwarf, assuming one could exist in nature?
