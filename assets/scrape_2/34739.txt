Why we can't see our Sun as it was a few years ago?

Our Sun is orbiting the center of the Milky Way galaxy. So many years ago, it was at a different location from where it is now.
In addition, we are observing stars and exoplanets as they were many years ago, for example stars like Sirius.. 
In this case, why can't we see our own Sun in its orbital path a few hundred years back. 
Is there any specific reason why we can't see/observe our Sun from the past?
