Discovery of Near Earth Objects (NEO's)

Near Earth Objects (NEO's) have been mapped by NASA and JPL since 1990's. The graph below shows how many of these potential planet-killers have been found and classified over the years. I am curious as to why there have been so many more 140 meter to 1 km NEO's discovered, as opposed to NEO's with a diameter of 1 km or more. I think it is as simple as there are just more "smaller" objects left over from the formation of the solar system? Am I correct in saying this, or are there deeper astronomical processes at play here?
