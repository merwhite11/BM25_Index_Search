Detection of the existence of any extraterrestrial life

We can't see things in "real-time" but we see the "past versions" of the things because it takes time for the light from that object to travel to us. So looking far away means looking back in time.
Does this mean even if some form of extraterrestrial life exists far far away (simultaneously with us) we won't be able to "see" it atleast for now?
