What would the temperature be on the surface of Sirius B

If Sirius B was a planet like Earth and not a white dwarf star what would the temperature be on the surface of Sirius B at its nearest and furthest distance? 8.2 AU to 31.5 AU
EDIT: I want to know if there is any combination of variables that would make Sirius B out to be the perfect distance for a habitable planet of certain specifications (and I'm not sure what those specs are).
