Star like moving object in the sky

Today morning, around 4 am, I saw a star like object moving from right to left with a speed faster than airplane and then it started moving from left to right and then vanished in the sky. After few minutes it again started moving from the same place it vanished, in forward direction and then again vanished, then again I saw it moving in same direction but from different direction where it vanished earlier.
I wonder what it was? It couldn't be a airplane for sure. Aeroplane doesn't fly that high and doesn't look like a star.
