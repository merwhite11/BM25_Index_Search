Why do we presume that the universe has always expanded?

When I read about the universe having always expanded from a 'singularity', I can't help but wonder if that is perhaps not the case. If a singularity is a point at which everything is infinite and is, theoretically, impossible, why are we quite so convinced it existed? What evidence is there that the universe didn't start out as a single square centimetre or even perhaps half the size it is now, because weve only known it's been expanding for the last century or so because of technological advances? Perhaps it was sizeable to begin with but the pressure of more atoms forming has pushed it outwards? Probably a ridiculous theory but Im intrigued to hear what others think about the whole subject because I just don't think the current presumption is based on any real evidence and is likely to be totally wrong.
