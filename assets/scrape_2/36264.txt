can we calculate the velocity of galaxies at the edge of the observable universe?

I read this post
Does the edge of the Universe travel faster than the speed of light?
but there was no calculation, so I tried it thusly:
The observable universe is 28.5 Gpc (gigaparsecs)
= 28500 Mpc (megaparsec)
https://www.google.com/search?q=diameter+of+the+observable+universe&oq=diameter+of+the+observable+universe&aqs=chrome..69i57.6887j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
The Hubble constant is 67.4 or 70 km/s/megaparsec.

Iâ€™ll use the older value 67.4
v=H x D = 28500 Mpc * 67.4 km/s Mpc = 1,920,000 km/s = 1.9 x 10^9 m/s
speed of light 2.998 x 10^8 m/s
So the velocity of expansion at the edge of the universe is >6x greater than the speed of light?
I read these posts
https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/107748/how-are-galaxies-receding-faster-than-light-visible-to-observers
So where are these measurements of galaxies moving faster than light?
and this
https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0011070v2.pdf
From the arxiv paper, I get that galaxies can be receding at 3c based on GR, but my simple calculation comes up with 6c.
Can someone help me reconcile my curiosity with the facts?
