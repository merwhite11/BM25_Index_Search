Why when we look through a telescope in space, do the billions of stars not block our view from seeing further?

I know that we are able to "see back into time" by looking very far away through telescopes such as the Hubble telescope, but my question is, wouldn't you run into at least a couple of stars that were blocking your vision when you were trying to look even farther? 
Imagine a big Boulder in front of another smaller Boulder  and if we are looking from the side of the larger Boulder, we wouldn't be able to see the smaller one because the bigger one was in the way. Hopefully that simplifies my question. If it is as simple as that, wouldn't we miss stars and not be able to view them?
