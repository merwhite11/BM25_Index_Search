Why doesn't Jupiter increase the chances of an asteroid to strike the Earth?

I often hear the hypothesis that Jupiter decreases the chances of an asteroid strike on the Earth, but my question is, why does it only decrease the chances ? 
While Jupiter can deflect some asteroids that were originally going to hit the Earth, it can also deflect some asteroids towards the Earth. How can we be sure that Jupiter only decreases the chances of an asteroid impact on Earth ?
