The systematic review of past observations in the hope of finding things that may have been missed

I seem to remember a TV science programme which re-examined the slides that led to the discovery of Pluto and then took a fresh look at earlier slides taken of the space which Pluto was passing through. These slides did indeed feature Pluto but were probably not part of Lowell’s search for the planet. Maybe the old data/images(if still on record) could be revisited with the advantage of later discoveries to reveal things of interest like say orphan planets?
Recently there was this case:-

Which inadvertently did this but are there any programmes/projects retrospectively doing this intentionally?’
So, it is the systematic review of past observations in the hope of finding things that may have been missed or even unknown at the time.
