Model/Infographic of plane of orbits and rotations planes of solar bodies (including their moons)

Is there a model/infographic with emphasis on the orbit and rotation plane of solar bodies? Of course, no scaling is needed for the size or distance. I remember reading there is one planet where the axis of its rotation is almost parallel to plane of its orbit.
