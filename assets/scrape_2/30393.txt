Why isn't the relativistic jet visible in the image of the M87 black hole?

I'm referring to the infamous relativistic jet, which consists of matter being accelerated to near the speed of light, originating at the poles of the black hole: 

But in the image of the black hole in the radio spectrum nothing of the sort is visible:  

I would expect the relativistic jet to be one of the most prominent features since it's accelerated much more that other material orbiting the black hole.  
Is it because the jet is more prominently visible in the visible and infrared spectrum than in the radio spectrum?
