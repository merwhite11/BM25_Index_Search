Can the asteroid belt be seen from Jupiter?

Suppose that someone lives in the neighborhood of Jupiter. He may live in a space station around Jupiter, or in any ot it's moons (I believe that it doesn't matter for this question). If this person look to the Sun he can see the asteroid belt, since it is between them? If generally not, then he would be able to see larger bodies such as Ceres?
