How long does it take for a galaxy (or other object) to disappear behind the cosmic sight horizon?

After looking at this question, I am wondering, how long does it take for a galaxy or other space object, to disappear from our view from the Milky Way due to the expansion of the universe? Assume GN-z11 is our target object here, or some other notable distant object.
Edit: As @PM2Ring said in a comment, "No galaxy that is observable today ever disappears (but does become increasingly redshifted." So when does a target galaxy get so redshifted that we cannot see it anymore?
