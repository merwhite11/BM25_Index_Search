how do I read grades for knowing where I have to look for watching the ISS?

I want to watch the ISS with naked eye using this tool NASA gives https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=Argentina&region=None&city=Santa_Fe#.WCRzKS3hC1s but I dont know how to read grades in the sense of which direction I have to look to, in order to see the ISS.
