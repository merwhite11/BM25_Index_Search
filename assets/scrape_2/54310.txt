Mismatch between Nasa Horizons Alt & Az data and theskylive and other star maps

I am trying to use NASA's Horizons systems to create a tracker for planets but I am running into a problem related to the returned ephemeris data, particularly with the altitude and azimuth. When comparing the values of a planet like Mars from Horizons to other star maps like theskylive I get values that are incredibly different.
Planet: Mars 

Lat/Long: [43.0000N, 79.0000W]

Date: 24/07/23 21:00 pm EST

Horizons Az&Alt: [223.53, 48.51]

theskylive Az&alt: [268.8, 14.6]

Am i doing something wrong?
