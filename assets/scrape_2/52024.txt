Orbital period of a planet orbiting Delta Pavonis in habitable zone

I'm continuing my inquiry about the fictional planet I have described here: https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/231162/length-of-seasons-on-a-planet-with-eliptical-orbit.
I'm now settled on the planet orbiting Delta Pavonis. According to data from Wikipedia and calculations, the habitable zone is from 0.78 to 1.56 AU.
My question is, what would be this planet's orbital period, keeping orbital eccentricity as high as possible while the planet stays within the habitable zone at all times?
I have tried calculating this using WolframAlpha, but it provides only formulae with the semi-major axis and primary and secondary mass, not eccentricity nor perihelion & aphelion distances.
