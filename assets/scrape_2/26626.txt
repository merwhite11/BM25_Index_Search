Are large body orbits self correcting?

If a rogue planet disrupts Earth's orbit slightly to cause a long winter or summer will the Earth's orbit normalize back close its original orbit over time? Could a Planet X or some other elliptical orbit large body revolving around the sun effect Earth's orbit by being inside the inner solar system?
