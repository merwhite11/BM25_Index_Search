Which are stars and which are noise in this comet photo?

The Forbes news article NASA's Hubble Telescope Snaps Best Images Yet Of Our First Interstellar Comet shows the image below (which I have since annotated) of comet 2I/Borisov (C/2019 Q4) and links to this series of Hubble images: https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=16009
Looking through the previews of those images, they all seem to have streaks of similar length and direction, so I am assuming that the telescope is tracking the comet's motion in each exposure and the streaks are stars, suggesting that all the small dots are noise and not stars.

Is that right?
Is the fuzzy one an extended object?
What causes so many isolated pixels to be so much brighter than the background? Is this just the tail of a statistical distribution of shot noise, or are there other mechanisms that can produce single pixel noise many standard deviations above  the statistical shot noise distribution?
