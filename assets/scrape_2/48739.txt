How are shockwaves used to study magnetic fields of merging galaxy clusters?

Recently i read an article about how a shockwave 60 times larger than milky way galaxy is generated.When these shockwaves interacts with magnetic field, radio waves are emitted. I wanted to know how these radio waves are used to study the magnetic field lines of the merging galaxy clusters?
