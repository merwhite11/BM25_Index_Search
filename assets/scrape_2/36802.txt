When was it worked out/discovered that our Sun can't go supernova?

As the title says, when did we realise with reasonable confidence that our star is not going to be going out in a supernova blaze of glory?
I ask because a while ago I read "The Songs of Distant Earth" by Arthur C. Clarke which was from 1986 (but based on an earlier story) and a plot point is that the sun went supernova. I was surprised that this was still considered a possibility in the 1980s but accepted it.
However, today I began reading "The Gods Themselves" by Isaac Asimov, written in 1972, and in it a character states that the Sun is too small to go supernova.
This confused me as I thought both Clarke and Asimov were both scientifically knowledgeable and informed.
I can find plenty of information online about how our Sun will likely end and why it won't go supernova but not any information on how long we have known (and therefore whether Asimov was ahead of his time or Clarke was uninformed in a way that would suprise me)?
