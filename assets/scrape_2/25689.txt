Why does kerr black holes have a ring shaped singularity rather than point?

I read about ring singularity on Wikipedia and didn't quite understand the flow of liquids inside a rotating body causing a ring shaped singularity with zero thickness. Moreover is it specifically ring shaped and not torus shaped in any case?
