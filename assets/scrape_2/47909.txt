Why are there 12 zodiac signs?

My friend and I are arguing whether it is because there are 12 months or there are 12 constellations along this path. It makes more sense to me that, since there are 12 months, they divided the path into 12 pieces since there are 12 months and named this pieces accordingly. Am I wrong?
Thanks in advance
