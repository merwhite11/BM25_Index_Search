Can stars be seen in the background when looking directly at our solar system?

Imagine viewing the solar system from the outside:

Considering the sun is quite bright, would you still be able to see stars in the background, or does the sunlight disable us to do so?
Consider this photo:

Does the light from the sun disable us from seeing stars in the background or have they simply been removed in an editor after the fact of being taken (the photo)?
Obviously there needs be some way of seeing stars from space, since looking at photos from space stations (or even from Earth) those are full of stars.
But, viewing the solar system from above (from the outside), can you see stars in the background or does the sunlight simply block them out?
