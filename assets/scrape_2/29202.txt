Possibility of certain conditions on a planet

I want to know if there can be any planet that can fulfill the following conditions and if any planet has been observed with such characteristics:

The planet must not be tidally locked.
The day-night cycle must be similar to our planet or smaller.
The planet must be so close to the star that the light emitted from the star 'burns' (can cause third degree burns to human skin within seconds after exposure).
Temperatures in the shadow cannot exceed 40-50Â°C (whether prolonged shadow during daytime or conditions during nighttime).
Atmosphere is not necessary.
