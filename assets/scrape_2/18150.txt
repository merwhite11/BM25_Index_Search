Would a black hole evaporate via Hawking radiation before you fall past the event horizon?

It takes an infinite amount of time for something to fall past the event horizon of a black hole from the perspective of someone outside the event horizon. Black holes also evaporate after a finite amount of time from an outsider's perspective  due to Hawking radiation. 
Does this mean that you would never actually reach the event horizon if you fell into a black hole because the black hole would evaporate?
