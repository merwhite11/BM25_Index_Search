Will 3,600ft asteroid be visible at my location tonight?

According to NASA, a 1.1-kilometer asteroid called 7482 (1994 PC1) will be visible tonight at 5:50PM.
How do I know if this asteroid will be visible at my location with the naked eye? When NASA says 5:50PM today, what location and/or timezone are they referring to?
Is there an intuitive iphone app that will help mere mortals like myself identify the stuff I see when I look up at the sky?
This is what I see in the NASA website https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/asteroids/#/asteroids/watch/7482_1994_pc1:
