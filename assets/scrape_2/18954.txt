Period coincidence of Planet Nine with furthest Kuiper belt objects

A lead scientist of the Planet Nine theory said that "The period with which it goes around the sun is a rational multiple of the periods of all the furthest Kuiper Belt objects"
To what degree of precision can Konstantin Batygin make that kind of measurement? Has it been backed up by other physicists with a degree of certainty?
He also says that they think it's near it's aphelion "because it hasn't been seen, so it's far away", not because of the above period coincidence, why can't they say where it is more convincingly?
Does that mean that they have very strong mathematical evidence for Planet Nine?
