Does the milky way have relativistic mass against galaxies which are moving away from it at high speeds?

According to the article cited behind, and to a post here in Astronomy SE , there are galaxies moving away from Milky Way faster than light, even at speeds of 2.3c . According to this article 
Can two galaxies move away from each other faster than light

The two galaxies we've been discussing are not travelling through
  space, it is the space between them that is expanding. Or put in
  another way, they are stationary and all the space around them is
  being stretched out. This is why it doesn't violate the theory of
  relativity, because it is not motion in the traditional sense.

So does this motion between galaxies "in not a traditional sense" count at all to calculate relativistic mass?
