The light of which star is next to reach the earth?

I heard that the sky wouldn't be dark at night if the light of every star had already reached the earth.

Of which (currently invisible) star will the light reach the earth next and when will that be?
What was the last star that we can now see at night to reach the earth and when was that?
How can we know (1) if the light hasn't even reached us yet? Or can't we know and will a star suddenly appear without anyone being able to predict that?
