Does the orbital velocity of a planet affect its escape velocity from the planet surfaces?

I'm trying to write a hard sci-fi novel with good accuracy, but when it comes to astronomy, I'm a total amateur.
Here's my fictional planet that orbit a black hole information:
Star Mass = 10000 Solar Masses
Planet Mass = 1 Earth Mass
The planet orbit is around 23 AU from the black hole. I did some calculations and it seems it had orbital velocity of 621 km/s. (compared to Earth: 30km/s).
But would it be harder for a rocket escape from the planet or otherwise?
