IAU Dwarf planet definition Point 2.b - is not a satellite

I am a bit confused with point 2.d of the IAU's resolution on dwarf planets.

(2) A "dwarf planet" is a celestial body that
(a) is in orbit around the Sun
(b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape
(c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit
(d) is not a satellite.

I notice that a lot of websites exclude this point all together? Some of
them even rather combine it with point 2.a ? Like over here
Feels a bit redundant, since orbits the sun implies not orbiting a planet?
Or am I missing something here?
