How close would a Sunlike star have to be in order to be dangerous to look at it through a spyglass?

Alpha Centauri A which has an about 50% higher luminosity than the Sun is obviously undangerous to look at through a handheld telescope, at about 4.4 ly distance. How close would a yellow dwarf have to be in order to make it dangerous to look at it through an average spyglass? Or to feel some heat on the eye through the spyglass? This question can also be seen reversed as "how far from the Sun would you have to be in order to look at the Sun through a spyglass without danger".
