Historic observational data - position of the planets

Is there an online source where historic observational data regarding the position of the planets can be found? I was always intrigued by the fact that Neptune was mathematically predicted before it was actually observed (wiki article). 
I am curios in finding more about this mathematical prediction regarding the existence of Neptune. Here are a few questions related to this:

Are there any detailed references on the subject? 
Is it possible to find the data which lead to this discovery online somewhere? 
Are there online resources regarding the position of the planets (now or at various points in the past)?
