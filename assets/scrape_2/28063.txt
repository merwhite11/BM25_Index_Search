Reflector vs refractor in terms of magnification, which one wins?

I'm thinking about getting a telescope and i'm debating between these 2 telescopes: meade and orion. Theyre both the same price so this question is not about the money, but about getting the most out of your money. I like the Meade 102 mm (or 4 inches) because it is a refractor, which means it is more lightweight and compact. The orion starblast 4.5 on the other hand is a reflector and therefore more clumsy.  
My question is, is a reflector necessarily better than a refractor in terms of magnification and sharpness of image? The orion does have a slightly bigger aperture (half inch bigger) but I don't think that makes a huge difference. The question really is, a reflector vs a refractor, which one is more desirable in terms of magnification, and how much of a difference does it make? 
Just judging from the reviews it would seem like the reflector (orion) wins the fight. For example, Saturn's rings according to some reviewers are "clearly visible" in the reflector, but not so with the refractor which most reviewers agree, Saturn will be very tiny and the rings barely visible.  
So will I settle for magnification if I get the refractor instead of the reflector, or are they basically the same and in that case I would choose the refractor (meade) over the reflector since it is more compact, and is also easier for beginners like me?
