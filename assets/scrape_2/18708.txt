Does the recent news of "ten times more galaxies" imply that there is correspondingly less dark matter?

Nature: Universe has ten times more galaxies than researchers thought
NASA feature: Hubble Reveals Observable Universe Contains 10 Times More Galaxies Than Previously Thought
Headlines sometimes oversimplify. But if this is really true, that there seems to be about ten times more galaxies than had been generally assumed, does this impact other assumptions? Does this imply the universe is ten times more massive, or just that there is less dark matter than was previously thought.
