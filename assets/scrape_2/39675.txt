What spectral type of star has an absolute magnitude of exactly 0?

We know that Vega is the star that serves as the zero point for the UBV color scale, and has an apparent magnitude of nearly zero (+0.02). But its absolute magnitude is +0.58, making it rather far from $M=0$. So what spectral type would have an absolute magnitude of $0 \pm0.02$, and are there any stars that satisfy this?
