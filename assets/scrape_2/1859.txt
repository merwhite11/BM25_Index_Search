When did the Moon become tidally locked to Earth?

According to various theories the Moon was created around 4.5 billion years ago. About all of these theories suggest that it was rotating around its axis at that time though. Currently, Moon is at tidal lock with Earth, despite some monthly "wiggling" a flat zero on the long-term rotation speed relative to it.
I wanted to ask when did that stop occur - relative to Moon's age, how long was the period of rotating Moon?
The answer would shed some light on my other question - Why are most lunar maria on the visible side? as Earth tends to catch or deflect many bodies heading for Moon surface from "our" direction - still, there is no erosion on the Moon, so craters once formed are extremely slow to vanish - if that period was relatively long, Earth's "protection" wouldn't explain the maria, as rotating Moon would get 'cratered' uniformly all over its surface.
