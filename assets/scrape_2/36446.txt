How much time passes in the outside universe when falling into a black hole?

If someone were to jump into a black hole, looking back at Earth, how far into the future would they see of Earth?  As I understand it, time would dilate approaching infinity as you approach the event horizon.  As I understand, time dilation would reach infinity for an infinitely small amount of time, but Planck time would probably prevent that infinity from arising.  How much time would pass in the outside universe as we fall in?  How far would we see into Earth's future, if we were looking back at it as we fell in?  This is further pondering my prior question and the answers received for:
Would time go by infinitely fast when crossing the event horizon of a black hole?
