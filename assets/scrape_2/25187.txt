Why is sun's photosphere a million times less dense than air at the surface of the Earth?

Sun's photosphere is about 19 times as hot as Earth's surface.

But Solar surface gravity is about 28 times terrestrial surface gravity.
So, shouldn't the density of gases at the photosphere of the sun be comparable to that on the surface of the Earth?
Why is the density of Sun's photosphere a million times lesser?

Essentially, what I am asking has been aptly worded in userLTK's answer, "how can the photosphere be so light and almost vacuum like under such high gravity (28 earth gravity)"?
Some of the answers have suggested that this may be because the Sun's photosphere is ionised. This doesn't seem to be accurate. The Hydrogen ionisation at optical depth = 1 is only 0.04%.
