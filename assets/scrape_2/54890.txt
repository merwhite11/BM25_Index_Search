Is the universe still considered "finite but unbounded"?

The BBC reports in Alien life in Universe: Scientists say finding it is 'only a matter of time' that Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Catherine Heymans, has said

We live in an infinite Universe, with infinite stars and planets."

Am I the only person to feel that this is such a gross simplification as to be inappropriate from somebody whose job is, fundamentally, to get things right?
She apparently goes on to say that

"And it's been obvious to many of us that we can't be the only intelligent life out there,"

which, whether I agree with it or not, I can't help but label as the "No true Scotsperson" fallacy.
