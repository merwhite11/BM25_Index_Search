How does the gravitational wave strain from a rotating binary depend on the chirp mass, frequency and distance & what a short derivation looks like?

Our most familiar experience with wave propagation either from firsthand experience or in school comes from the phenomena of sound and light and radio electromagnetic propagation.
In air, we know that the strength of these waves as measured in sound pressure level and intensity (as measured by a photodetector or eye) drop off as $1/r^2$. However if you measure the electric field of a radio wave rather than its intensity, that drops as $1/r$.
For gravitational wave observations, we measure the strength and frequency of a strain wave and wonder where it is (direction and how far), the mass of the rotating system.
(Direction comes from having multiple GW detectors aligned in different directions.)
Thus it is helpful to know the scaling law between the magnitude of the strain wave and the mass of the system, the rotational speed, and the distance.
Thus I'd like to ask:
