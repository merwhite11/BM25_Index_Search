Was the Geocentric Model correct at all?

It's easy to find resources stating that the heliocentric model is right and geocentric is wrong.
But how wrong was it? Was it correct in any way?
It was built on incorrect assumptions, but despite that - was it of any use to describe the apparent motion of celestial bodies? Was it more accurate for some things, but less accurate for others? Or was it altogether a flop and astronomers couldn't get anything out of it either way?

I can only find multiple articles proving the heliocentric model, explaining the geocentric one or claiming that it was simply wrong - but I can't find anything about its accuracy and usefulness.

Edit 1:
I incorrectly used geocentric model when it seems I wanted to say Ptolemaic model - the one with deferents and epicycles, with Earth as its origin.

Thank you for clarifying, and sorry for the confusion. The answers provided regarding any other geocentric models are still valid and useful, so this is just a minor errata.
