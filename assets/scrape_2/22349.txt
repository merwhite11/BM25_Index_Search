Why do we we even exist?

It came to my mind one day that why does this universe even exist and why do we even exist and like we are enclosed in the so called atmosphere and a floating rock in space called the Earth, so is there any possibility that the universe is also enclosed in something and if it is, then what is outside that enclosure?
