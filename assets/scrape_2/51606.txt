Can we use plain mirror as a secondary mirror in cassegrain telescope?

I was planning of making a telescope like JWST, just with plain mirrors, as bigger concave or convex are much expensive. The primary mirror would be totally made of plain mirrors configured like JWST. I'm having doubt regarding secondary mirror: can i use plain there?
