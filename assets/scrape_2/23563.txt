Astronomical ABCD...!

Today, I thought to make a list of Astronomical objects, A to Z. 
It goes as follows :

A - Asteroid
B - Black Hole
C - Comet
D - Dwarf Planet
E - Elliptical Galaxy
F - Falling Star
G - Globular Cluster
H - Hypergiants (Stars)
I - Interstellar Medium
J - Jets (Astrophysical)
K -  $\color{red} ?$
L - Lenticular Galaxy
M - Meteor
N - Nebula
O - Open Cluster
P - Pulsar
Q - Quasar
R - Rogue Planets
S - Satellites
T -   $\color{red} ?$
U - Universe
V - Variable Star
W - White Dwarf
X - X-ray Star
Y - Yellow dwarf star
Z -    $\color{red} ?$

But I couldn't think of something well-known from the letters K, T and Z. 
I tried to avoid using name of something specific object for ex. K - Kuiper Belt.
Can you please help me in completing this list?
Thanks!
