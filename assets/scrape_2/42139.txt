Frequency analysis on Semiperiodic object(s) using Lomb-Scargle

So I already did a frequency analysis of the SRv-type's light curve  using Period04. I already have the 'periodicities' of the object/star of choice which is quite hard since the latter/other periods are tucked away by yearly aliases (thank goodness that's a rough week).
The problem, however, is that the mentioned-software doesn't allow the user to acquire the Power Spectrum but only the Fourier data (as of the moment) which is important for visualizing the non-coherent signals. May I kindly ask if it's possible to deduce/extract the power spectrum from the fourier data using Lomb-Scargle periodogram? And if there's an existing python tool/code to it?
The current code, which is below bog standard I'm afraid, just visualizes the Fourier spectrum;
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
with pd.option_context('display.float_format', '{:0.20f}'.format):
    data = pd.read_csv('FLSP.csv')
    print(data) #shows Frequencies/Amplitudes

x = data['Frequency']
y = data['Amplitude']

plt.xlabel('Frequency')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')

plt.plot(x, y)

Which should give you something (as useless) like this;

It's the Long Secondary Period (LSP) of the variable star at ~2350 days. Attach here is the fourier data if you want to check out.
Help at this point is sincerely appreciated. Thnx a lot and clear skies.
Note: I tried using Astropy's and Scipy's Lomb-Scargle, and their implementations require the observations; light curve, so I'm stuck on 'looking' at the fourier spectrum...suggesting to me that's its back to square one (hoping not lol).
