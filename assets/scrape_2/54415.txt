The Occurrence Rate of Lunar/Solar Eclipses and Its Effect on a Planet

I was pondering over ideas for fantasy worlds and came across one that begged a question about the effect of eclipses on the Earth. If a total lunar/solar eclipse happened every 80 years or so instead of the current frequency, what else might change about Earth? I tried searching around but didn't quite get an answer I wanted. We can assume convenient rotational axes or orbit habits to help answers, the scope is more about on the planet itself (not solar system-wise). Basically, considering realistic or reality-adjacent physics.
Specifically:

1.) Diurnal cycle of this planet (night and day cycle length)
2.) The Sun/Moon's relative size and distance from this planet
3.) Is the moon a satellite planet to this planet?
4.) Would tides be normal/faster/longer? Would the bodies of water be different?

Anything else you may add would be great too! I appreciate any help, and I hope you have a great one.
