Why is it impossible for a Quasi Star to exist these days?

I've heard about quasi stars a while ago, but I've just recently decided to go more in-depth about the characteristics and facts about them. I learned that they gain their energy through radiation when matter falls into the black hole in the core. I may be wrong about this part, though. I also learned that they can't exist these days because the universe's gases are polluted with metals. Why does that stop quasi stars from existing?
Edit request from comment: A quasi star is a hypothetical star that existed in the early ages of the universe. It got its energy from a black hole at its core, unlike normal stars that get energy through nuclear fusion.
