any proof that stars are born, and die?

B"H
There is a common belief among many individuals that stars originate from black holes, undergo a growth phase, and eventually meet their demise through a supernova or similar event. However, have there been any documented instances of such phenomena occurring from start to finish? Furthermore, what evidence substantiates the notion that stars are born, mature, and expire, as opposed to perpetually existing in their current form and size? Please refrain from dismissing this inquiry with the assertion that birth is a necessary precondition, as this may not be the case.
