Is there a theory about a collision between a shrinking universe and a new expanding universe?

I recently read a post on a discussion board about the creation of our current universe that stated, and I quote:

[T]he shrinkage activity of the old universe and the new Big Bang expansion movement still made a tremendous collision, resulting in the diffusion and spiral of fine particles.The diffusion of fine particles was integrated into a swirl to reduce the collision and the thermal activity became mature, but the expansion of the fine particle spiral group by the Big Bang is still progressing, expanding while colliding with the shrinking old matters of the old universe There. New matters cooperate solidly with a spiral net to the whole universe as a gear that rotates at the same speed. 

I am just an amateur interested in astronomy, but I have never heard of a theory regarding such an event before. Is this a known theory that has been researched?
