Is there a (proposed) name for Coatlicue's progenitor?

Our sun's theorized progenitor star carries the (proposed) name Coatlicue. Since our sun is thought to be a third generation* star there should be two generations preceding it - and therefore one generation preceding Coatlicue.
Is there a proposed name for Coatlicue's predecessor(s)? If so, that would for example make discussing it or researching it simpler.

* note: third generation, not population III. The sun is in fact a population I or heavy-element-rich star.
