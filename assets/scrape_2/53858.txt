What moons have cleared their orbits?

The Wikipedia article Clearing the Neighborhood lists three numeric parameters that can be calculated for bodies orbiting the Sun as a way to indicate orbital dominance: Stern and Levinson's $\Lambda$, Margot's $\Pi$, and Soter's $\mu$. It seems reasonable to apply these criteria to orbits of moons about their primaries, but I have not seen it done. Has anyone looked to see if any of these criteria divide the moons of (at least) Saturn or Jupiter into clearcut dynamically-based primary and secondary categories? If so, what are the primary moons? (OK, I think I know the answer for Jupiter, but Saturn might be more interesting.) And might there be more than two natural categories? I can easily imagine a clear quantitative distinction between Saturn's larger moons, the little ones, and the ring particles.
