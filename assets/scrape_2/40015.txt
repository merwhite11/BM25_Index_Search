How small could an orbital system be in our solar system?

Answers to How does the Sun's gravity have so much force and pull on the solar system? How does it scale? Newton's law of gravity scales on orbits so that we can theorize very small orbits with very small masses.
Could two hydrogen molecules orbit one another or would external gravity prevent them from having a stable orbit? We know there are quite small orbital systems in our own asteroid belt, but is there a practical limit to how small an orbital system (with the little orbital system also orbiting the Sun) can be in terms of total mass of the orbital system?
