Specific word for the point of the terrestrial surface "under" a star or other object in the sky

The title says it : I am looking for the word to use for a point, located on Earth surface (maybe an hypothetical perfectly spherical Earth), that has the same coordinates as a specific star, and therefore can be considered to be "under" the star in layman's terms.
