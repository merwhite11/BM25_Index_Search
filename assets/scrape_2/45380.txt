Solar planets' aphelion longitudes in 2021?


What is the ecliptic longitude of the aphelion of each of the solar planets (Moon, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) currently in 2021 and from the observer's point of view on the earth? Please note I don't want to know their distances from the sun at their states of aphelion but their locations on the ecliptic while they are in aphelion states.

Does earth's axial precession cause the ecliptic longitude of planets' aphelions to change?
