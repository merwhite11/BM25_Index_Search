Transforming Galactic Coordinates in Cartesian with Distance

Lets say I have galactic coordinates of an object, l and b.
I figured out that i can transform them to cartesian system using the formula:
$$
\begin{align}
X &= \cos(b)\cos(l)\\
Y &= \cos(b)\sin(l)\\
Z &= \sin(b)
\end{align}
$$
Giving me a vector on the celestial sphere. So far so good, now I want to know the exact position of the object. Using 1/parallax, I compute the distance. Therefore I multiply it 
with my vector to find out the exact cartesian position of the object.
$$
\begin{align}
X &= \textstyle\frac{1}{p}  \cos(b)\cos(l)\\
Y &= \textstyle\frac{1}{p} \cos(b)\sin(l)\\
Z &= \textstyle\frac{1}{p} \sin(b)
\end{align}
$$
What I want to know is if this calculation is correct and if not, what do I have to change or reconsider? Thanks!
