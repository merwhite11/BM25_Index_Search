Is there an antonym for 'transit', i.e. the transit of a celestial body through the meridian

I'm writing software to calculate the rising, transit, and setting of a body on the celestial sphere for a specific location and date. It seems to me that the opposite of transit, at least in the case of the Sun and for circumpolar stars, would also be of importance.
In the northern hemisphere this would be the time when a circumpolar star would pass through the line between the celestial north pole and true north, and be at its lowest height above the horizon.
Is there an antonym (opposite) for the word transit?
