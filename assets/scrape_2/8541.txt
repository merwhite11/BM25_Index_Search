How fast does Venus move as seen from the earth?

So last night I was about to sleep with the window in front of me. there was a 3 inch gap between the curtains that let me see a small portion of the sky. I could see something magnificently bright in the sky that couldn't be anything but Venus. So while I was looking at it for about 1-2 minutes it gradually moved out of my sight. That seemed pretty fast. I mean I kinda estimated that with such a speed it could move from east to west in less than 2 hours.
So is that normal?
