Focus Problems when using Barlow 3x or 4mm lens

So I just recently bought a Celestron Powerseeker 127EQ 12.7 cm f/7.87 Cassegrain telescope and I inserted a 20mm eyepiece and the telescope with the Moon.
That eyepiece seems to work fine, but when I use it with a 3x Barlow lens the moon seems to look a bit blurry compared to the 20mm eyepiece itself.
It gets worse when I use a 4 mm eyepiece and I can't seem to get the focus correct. Any fixes to this?
