Is a black hole a 5 dimensional vortex?

We know that a black hole behaves like a whirlpool or a tornado or any of the other rotating phenomena we experience on Earth.But the thing is, all these phenomena, except the black hole, are 2-Dimensional (plus 1 dimension of time) rotating vortices, they move objects from 2D planes to other 2D planes instantly, but through a 3D medium. My question is this, since a black hole is a rotating sphere(3D for that matter, plus 1D of time), does it mean that its endpoint in the vortex is 5D?
