Is there an advantage to the equatorial region of the far side of the moon for a radio telescope or would any crater on the far side work?

If nearly any crater on the far side of the moon will work, and not just equatorial craters, then we could pick craters near the possible future Artemis base at the South pole which would allow easier access.  My assumption is as long as the crater is outside the range of Earth and the satellites in orbit it would be essentially the same as an equatorial crater.
