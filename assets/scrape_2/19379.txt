What is the tidal radius of the Sirius system?

The Fomalhaut system is a trinary system, with Fomalhaut A (1.9 M), Fomalhaut B (0.7M) and Fomalhaut C (0.2M). Fomalhaut C is 2.5 light years from Fomalhaut A, and 3.2 light years away from Fomalhaut B. The tidal radius of the Fomalhaut system is 6.2 light years.
The Sirius system (Sirius A, 2M, Sirius B, 0.9M) is roughly 1.1x more massive than Fomalhaut A and B. What would be some ways to calculate a tidal radius of the Sirius sytem, to get an estimate of at what distance other stars could orbit the Sirius system?
