Semimajor axes data from Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog

I have been searching for a massive binary (>7 M$_{\odot}$) catalog with semimajor axes given, but I wasn't able to find any, and I began to search for a binary star catalog and decided to filter it later.
A bit of a googling leads to the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog, though useful, it doesn't have semimajor axes in it.
Please share links to how to calculate semimajor axes from the orbital period. Also, it would be much better if a catalog with binary separation data in it could be shared.
Thank you!
