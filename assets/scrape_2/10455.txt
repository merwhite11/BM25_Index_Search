Why does Venus flicker?

I was watching Venus with the naked eye yesterday at about 7 pm and I noticed that it was flickering, almost like a star.
I have always learned that planets don't flicker to the naked eye, only stars (indeed, every other time I've seen a planet it wasn't flickering), so I was rather confused. I even checked Stellarium to make sure that what I was seeing was, in fact, Venus.
Does anybody have an explanation for that behaviour?
Thank you all.
