What causes the halo in JWST's new image of Jupiter?

Then new JWST image of Jupiter shows a small halo on the right side of the planet.  What's causing this feature?  I figure it could be that the planet is simply overexposed (or moving slightly during the exposure?). Or perhaps this is a phase effect, and the boundary between the light and dark limbs corresponds to the jovian terminator?
