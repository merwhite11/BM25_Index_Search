How to compute satellite coordinates (lat,long) given antenna's coordinates, angles and satellite height

Given an Earth station (antenna) coordinates (in lat,long) ant its Elevation (El) and Azimuth (Az), how to compute the satellite coordinates (lat,long), known its height?
For simplification purposes, the Earth can be considered as an sphere.
So its given:
Earth Radius = 6371000 meters
Satellite Height, in meters (perpendicular to the Earth's)

Station lat, long (as parameters)
Station height (0 = Zero, for simplification purposes)
Station Elevation (angle, radius or degrees)
Station Azimuth (angle, radius or degrees)

In summary: I'm trying to calculate satellite's coordinates projected on celestial sphere. I.e. it's current ground track position from the horizontal coordinate system values and the position of the observation.
The problem can be shown in this two figures:
