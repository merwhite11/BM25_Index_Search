Are we seeing a conjunction these mornings?

I have a doubt about planetary conjunction.
These days, we can see Saturn, Mars, Jupiter and the Moon close to each other.
I mean if Saturn, Mars, Jupiter and the Moon were in conjunction with each other, last February, 19th, 2020.
Is this a conjunction or is it an alignment?
