How can a rotation period of a planet's satellite/moon be "chaotic" (like Hyperion around Saturn)?

According to wikipedia (see info below image) Hyperion's rotation period around Saturn is "chaotic".
What does that mean? The period (in days/hours) is different every rotation without any law helping to define it?
How can it be?
