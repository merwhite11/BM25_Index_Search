Does the mass of the observable universe ever change?

First do we have anyway to even estimate the mass of the entire observable universe?  And then is there any data that shows mass being gained or lost?  Would we ever know if someone was playing with the til.  
Also I want to be clear that I am not talking about small masses on the outskirts of the "universe" or small discrepancies in measurement or anything of the sort.  
Note:  I would like to add that maybe we should define the observable universe as NOW (x-date) so that we aren't calculating a moving target.
