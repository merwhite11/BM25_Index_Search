Astrophysical Jet Size?

I am wondering about what is the estimated size of astrophysical jet that shoots out from a black hole, I donâ€™t know if it is determined by the size of a black hole.
What would classify a black hole that is able to have at least 10 planets orbit it? Is it considered stellar?
If so, what would the estimated astrophysical jet or quasar be?
