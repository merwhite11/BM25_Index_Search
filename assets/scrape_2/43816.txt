Cosmic variance - Fourier Transform - a few precisions

I have posted initially on physics exchange but none answer, so I try my chance here (I am going to delete the physics exchange one) :
I cite an original report of a colleague :

If we are interested in power spectrum, we want to estimate the
variance of the amplitude of the modes $\mathrm{k}$ of our Fourier
decomposition. If one observes the whole observable Universe and we
do the Fourier transformation we get a cube whose center is the mode
$ |\vec{k}| = 0$ which corresponds to the mean value of the observed
field.
This mode has only one pixel. How do we measure the variance of the
process at $ |\vec{k}| = 0 $? We can not.
In fact we can but the value of doesn't mean anything because the
error is infinite. In other words, we have an intrinsic (statistical)
error which depends on the number of achievements to which we have
access.
one will be able to consider spheres of sizes $ dk $ between $ [k: k +
> dk] $ which will contain a number of pixels $ N_ {k} = V_ {k}/(dk)^{3}$ where $ V_{k} = 4 \pi k^{2} dk $ is the volume of the sphere
and $ (dk)^{3} $ is the volume of a pixel in our Fourier transform
cube.
So one can estimate how many values one can use to calculate our
power spectrum for each value of $ k $. The greater the $ k $, the
greater the number of accessible values and therefore the statistical
error decreases. The power spectrum is a variance estimator so the
statistical error is basically a relative error:
$ \dfrac{\sigma (P(k))}{P(k)} = \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{N_{k}
> -1}}_{\text{with}} N_{k} \approx 4\pi \left (\dfrac{k}{dk}\right)^{2} $
So we can see that for the case $|\vec{k}| = 0$ we have an infinite error because $N_{k} = 1$


I can't manage to proove that the statistical error is formulated like :

$\dfrac{\sigma (P (k))}{P(k)} = \sqrt{\dfrac {2}{N_{k} -1}}_{\text{with}} N_{k} \approx 4\pi \left(\dfrac{k}{dk}\right)^{2}$
and why it is considered like a relative error ?

Which are the conditions to assimilate a statistical error (standard deviation) to a relative error ($\dfrac{\Delta x}{x}$) ?

How to prove that $N_{k} = 1$ in the case $|\vec{k}| = 0$ ?


Any help is welcome.
