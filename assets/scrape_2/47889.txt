What is going on with comet C/2021 A1 Leonard? Is it going to be bright this weekend or not?

I have to plan an excursion to try to find clear evening skies to try to see if we can spot comet C/2021 A1 Leonard about 10 to 15Â° above the ocean in the Southwest after sunset this weekend.
I'm completely baffled by this plot of magnitude vs time. It looks like something unexpected is happening or already happened with the comets brightness.
Am I too late?
Roughly what visual magnitude can I expect, and what (if anything) did we miss?
Is there an out-of-the-ordinary disparity between visual and CCD brightnesses?
