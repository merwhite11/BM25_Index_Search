Is there any free stacking program that stack images which are not aligned?

I liked to photo deep-sky-objects and planets with my camera Canon sx130. But I have never stacked images because they were too much apart. I was looking for some free astronomy stacking program for stacking photos that aren't perfectly aligned, like doing the mosaics, but I found just Deep Sky Stacker. It does not stack images that aren't aligned and I have some troubles with it.
For examples, I want to stack this image:
¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸×¸
¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
and this image:
¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
¸×¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
("¸" is the dark sky and "×" is a planet.)
Any help?
