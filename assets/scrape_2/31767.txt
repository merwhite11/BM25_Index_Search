Why is the equinoxes only 2 days and not more?

The earth is tilted at 23.5 degrees which means that in the solstices the north/south hemisphere is more radiated by the sun and the tilt to the sun is maximum.    
In the equinoxes, the tilt is not towards the sun but to the "side" so the equator has direct exposure to the sun. As a result, we have 12 hours on day and night on the equinoxes.   
What I don't understand is why is it only for these 2 days (equinoxes) that this happens. In the next day(s) I think the equator should have the same exposure to the sun as the equinoxes. Has the tilt changed so much?
I couldn't find any animation that shows the exact path of the tilt throughout the year.
Can someone please help me understand this?
