How to know when the moon is visible on a particular night?

I am looking for beginners information on how I can know when the Moon is going to be visible on a particular night ?
Google-fu says to look for moonrise information about my city from websites such as https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/australia/darwin
So if I followed the above guide for today and started walking on a plane field West-NorthWest direction, at 10.01 PM I should be able to see the Moon. Is my understanding correct? Or is there another way to know when Moon will be visible on a particular (clear) night.
