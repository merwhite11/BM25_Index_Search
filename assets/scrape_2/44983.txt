Task about equinox and upper culmination

I'm trying to solve this task:

At what local time is the point of autumn equinox at its upper culmination three weeks after the vernal equinox?

I think it has something to do with the sidereal day (23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds), but at what time should I start counting?
Could someone please explain this? Thanks for any help.
