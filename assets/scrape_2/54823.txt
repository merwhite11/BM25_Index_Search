How is the Cosmic Microwave Background so big?

If the CMB is an image of the universe when it was 379,000 years old, how is it so large? Since the light is 13.8 billion years old, the image represents the surface of a sphere with a radius of 13.8 billion light years, and I don't think the universe would have been that large at that age. Even if it was, an image from further back in time would be larger, which doesn't make any sense, since the universe expands.
