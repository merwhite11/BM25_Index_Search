Calculating the luminosity of a comet

Assuming a 9-km comet is heading towards the Earth and it is at distance 5.2 AU away from the Sun, what is its luminosity? Assume that it has an albedo of 0.5?
For now, I have calculated the Sun's flux at the comet's location.
$$F=\frac{3.8\times10^{26}W}{4\pi\left(7.78\times10^{11}m\right)^2}=50.74\frac{W}{m^2}$$
I have used the flux of the Sun and the distance of the comet from the Sun to the in meters. I was thinking that I could calculate the area of the comet seen  from the Earth and then calculate the luminosity of the comet. However, I have no idea how to calculate the effective area of the comet.
