Schechter Luminosity Function fitting plot of galaxies

I would like to plot the Schechter Luminosity function of galaxies. Here is my data(I have the Luminosity L[Ha] in erg/s).
I would like to plot like this figure from this paper.
In this paper, they used these equations for the plotting(there are four datasets in this case, but for my case, I want to plot only my data).


I used python to plot the function. Here is my code. But, I am not able to plot it. Kindly do help me with this. Also How to do the fitting with my data to get the required parameters.
import numpy as np, math
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from astropy.table import Table
from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

data=Table.read('lum.fits')

def Schechter_Lum(L, L_star=None, Alpha=None, P_star=None):
'''
Schechter luminosity function in LUMINOSITY  
number per dex
'''
ratio = L/L_star
f = P_star* np.exp**(-ratio) *(ratio)**Alpha *ratio*np.log(10.) 
return(f)

#For the reference, I used this value from the paper
L_star=42.64
P_star=-3.32
Alpha= -1.75

schechter_lf=Schechter_Lum(data['ha_luminosity_log'],L_star,Alpha,P_star)

plt.plot(data['ha_luminosity_log'],schechter_lf)
plt.yscale('log')
plt.title('H$\alpha$ Luminosity Functions')
plt.xlabel(r'Log (L[H$\alpha$]) erg/s', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel(r'$\varphi$(logL) per $Mpc$^{-3}$ per logL',fontsize=14)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

I am not able to get the figure properly and I am not able to perform fitting of my Luminosity function. Kindly do help with this. Thank You.
