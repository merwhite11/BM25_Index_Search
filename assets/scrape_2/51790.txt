After a Type Ia supernova explosion, what becomes of the degenerate matter?

A white dwarf below 1.44 solar mass in a binary system may accrete mass from its companion. If its core reaches the temperature for carbon fusion during this process, the white dwarf may reignite in a runaway fusion. The runaway fusion could release sufficient energy to unbind the white dwarf in a type Ia supernova. An earlier answer mentioned that the star is completely destroyed in a type Ia supernova.
Since the degenerate matter in the core of the white dwarf is the result of the gravitational compression, what becomes of the degenerate matter once the white dwarf is unbound?
