Jupiter's asteroid-like moons and planetary-systems around sub-brown dwarfs

Is it likely that any of Jupiter's small moons were formed in orbit around Jupiter or are they all captured asteroids? I thought of this question because I wondered whether the planetary-system of a sub-brown dwarf would have any asteroids or just round planets.
