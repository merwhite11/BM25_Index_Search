Definition of a moon in an exam: "A satellite of a planet that *doesn't produce light itself but reflects it*" - is there relevance for the emphasis?

In a 5th-grade exam (for 10-11-year-old pupils in Finland), there was a question, "What is a moon?" The model answer was: "A satellite of a planet that doesn't produce light itself but reflects it." Most pupils answered simply "A satellite of a planet" and received half the points, which is also what I would have answered!
To my understanding, planets don't have satellites that are stars (i.e., ones that produce light themselves) or ones that don't reflect any light (like black holes?). Therefore, I don't see why the second part of the answer is relevant.
I am looking for arguments to correct the evaluation.
