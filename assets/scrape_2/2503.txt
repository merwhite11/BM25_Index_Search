Pulsation Modes of Cepheids

There are various modes of Cepheids like

single modes: 
   fundamental (F), 
   first overtone (1O), and likewise.

And then we have 

double modes: F/1O, 1O/2O etc.
triple modes: 1O/2O/3O etc.

What are these modes actually? What do they mean and which frequencies do they correspond to?
Stellar pulsations are caused by expansions and contractions in the outer layers as a star seeks to maintain equilibrium. What kind of equilibrium is being referred to here?
