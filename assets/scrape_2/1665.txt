If galaxies are moving away from each other then why are the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy coming towards each other?

The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 684000 mi/hours, making it one of the few blueshifted galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are thus expected to collide in about 3.75 or 4.5 billion years.
Why are some galaxies moving away and why are our galaxy and Andromeda coming towards each other?
