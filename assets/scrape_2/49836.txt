Using cosmological model GADGET - 4

I want to use GADGET-4 "a parallel cosmological N-body and SPH code meant for simulations of cosmic structure formation and calculations relevant for galaxy evolution and galactic dynamics" or similar computational tools to study and emulate how two galaxies interact, based on a set of initial conditions (ICs) that I define. I tried GADGET - 4 for a set of demo ICs that came with the model. However, I could not find any tool to define the ICs of my choice. Is there some cookbook I can refer to which will guide me on how to go about the same?
