Are the stars seen at the equator different throughout the year?

If you live on the equator and look up at the night's sky at, say, midnight, would you see a completely different sky on the 1st of January than you would on the 1st of July?
I assume you would as the night side would be facing away from the sun by 180 degrees and necessarily looking outward from the solar system 180 degrees from each of the two points at those times.
Is that correct?
Why?
