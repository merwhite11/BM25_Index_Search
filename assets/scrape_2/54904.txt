A solar system of solar systems

The moon orbits Earth, earth orbits Sol. It's true that Sol orbits the galactic center, but that's not what this question is about.
Is it possible for a solar system like the Sol system, along with at least two more solar systems, orbit a single, more massive star? (Where we have a solar system of planets, this would be a solar system of solar systems.)
