Ratios of magnitudes instead of differences

The color index in the photometric system is defined by the differences in magnitudes between two wavelength filters, which gives the ratio of intensities. For example, to determine the B-V index, you'd need the magnitudes in the B band (which is centered on $\lambda = 445$nm) and in the V band, centered on $\lambda = 551$nm.
But what about other operations? For instance, would there be any significance in taking, say, the ratio $B/V$ or $B\times V$?
