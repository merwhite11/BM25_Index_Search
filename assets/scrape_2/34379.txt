Comet 289P/Blanpain sudden outburst?

So Sky Safari has shown that comet 289P/Blainpain has had a sudden increase in brightness, and is currently sitting at mag -1.4!!! Last week it was sitting at +15. It is due to reach Perihelion on 20th December (2 days time) so is this due to some outburst? Or is there a glitch in Sky Safari? Looking at THIS site, it states:

When the perihelion distance is larger than 1.0 A.U., it becomes very
  bright if it passes the perihelion on a special day in early December.
  However, only if the perihelion passage shifts by a several days.

But the Perihelion distance is 0.089AU for this year according to Google
This comet could be prone to outbursts as it was recently rediscovered in July 2013 due to a sudden brightness increase from an outburst (although nowhere near this much!)
However, currently TheSkyLive is showing that it is currently at mag +18. 
I have had a quick search to try and verify this, unfortunately, I live in England and our skies are very cloudy at the moment so I can't go out and see for myself. Does anyone have any information as to whether this is a Sky Safari glitch or if not, what has happened to cause such a huge brightness increase?
