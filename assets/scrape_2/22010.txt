Why are ice giants not considered suitable for life?

Ice giants are currently not considered suitable for life due to temperature, pressure and composition.  This paper gives some parameters for life in regards to temperature, pressure and composition:

Temperature: $-15\ ^\mathrm{o}C$ to $122\ ^\mathrm{o}C$
Pressure Upper Limit: $1,100\ \mathrm{atm}$, and 
Composition to Include: liquid water, $C$, $N$, $S$, and $P$.  

I'm trying to find out what the conditions of the hot dense ammonia/water mantle border with the hydrogen/helium atmosphere are, in regards to temperature and pressure. We know the mantles are under very high pressures, have liquid water (though in a likely different state due to pressures), C, N and S. What are the pressures and temperatures at this mantle border?  Specifically in reference to Uranus and Neptune.
