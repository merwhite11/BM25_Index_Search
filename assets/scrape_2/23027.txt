How did the lighter elements end up in the center of the solar system? Solar System Formation

The previous generation of stars famously are the origin of all the heavier elements (up until iron?) in the solar system. So a big portion of the solar system mass actually is made up of Carbon, Silicon, Iron and the like because of that. But in the center, and only in the center, there is a star with presumably almost no heavy elements inside. How can that be? Am I wrong about the actual mass concentrations or is there really an imbalance, i.e. is the element distribution really lighter towards the center of the solar system? I would presume that the previous generation of stars just ended in a more or less uniform cloud of debris, from which the solar system formed. But if so, why arenâ€™t there star systems where the star has a very different composition and is kind of a spluttering, dirty fusion machine (metaphorically, I mean)?
