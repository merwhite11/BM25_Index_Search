Would bacteria on incoming meteors burn before impacting?

I was watching an old Ancient Aliens last night and there was a whole episode dedicated to how the "Gods" (aliens) were spreading disease/plagues.  
A good portion of the show was dedicated to how aliens may be sending meteors to Earth with bacteria to spread disease.  
Part of this was several scientists talking about an experiment with a rock set in orbit (forgive me that I don't have a link to this).  Said rock had many forms of bacteria on it and after a certain amount of time they grabbed the rock and confirmed that some bacteria can survive space conditions.
Then there were other scientists saying that some forms of bacteria/virus may even get worse in zero gravity or space conditions - used salmonella as an example.
But my question is does this even matter?  Wouldn't any bacteria or virus colonies on a meteorite just burn up in our atmosphere?
