Where is it possible to observe the Moon for 24 hours?

I wrote an astronomy olympiad yesterday and there was one task I couldn't figure out an answer to:

Estimate at what latitudes it is possible to observe the Moon for at least 24 hours.  Under what conditions is it possible to observe the phenomenon at border latitudes?

Is it possible at all to observe the Moon for such a long time?
