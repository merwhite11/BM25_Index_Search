How do we know that the mass ratio of hydrogen and helium in the sun is approximately 3:1?

From what I learnt, we can find what elements are in the sun by analysing spectrums since each elements has same emission spectrum, and when you look at the sun's spectrum, you can see absorption spectrum missing some lines which is the elements.
But how do we know how much are there? Are there other ways to find out how much of each elements contributes to the sun?
And how can this become an evidence of Big Bang?
Are these even correct?
(Can you explain it easily)
