Is the curvature of Mars visible from the top of Olympus Mons?

Would you be able to see the curvature of Mars from the top of Olympus Mons? And how much curvature would you see if it was visible, would it be only barely detectable, or would you see a lot of curvature?
Olympus Mons is 25km high and the tallest known mountain in the Solar System.
Mars is just over half the size of Earth.
Here on Earth, the curvature of the planet is hardly visible from the height of commerical aeroplane (roughly 10km).  I was wondering, considering the height of Olympus Mons and the size difference of Mars, if the curvature from up there would be very pronounced.
