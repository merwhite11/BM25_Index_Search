When analyzing a particle moving at Kepler speed, √(GM/R) in a planetary magnetic field, do we need to convert it to angular speed, √(GM/R^3)?

A charged particle is moving in a planetary magnetic field, in a spherical polar coordinates which is corotating with the magnetic field. To solve the equations of motion numerically what would be the initial azimuthal speed $\frac{d\phi}{dt}$, if the particle initially moving with the Kepler speed,$\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$ along the equatorial in the co rotational direction? Do we need convert the keppler speed into the corresponding angular speed, $\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}}$ as the azimuthal speed is in radian/s while the kepler speed is in m/s? The same question goes what if I only know the initial speed in km/s, say 20km/s how would I input this?
