How can the Earth and the Moon be in synchronous rotation if the Moon won't be in geostationary orbit?

It is said that the Moon moves away from Earth and that during the Sun's red giant or white dwarf phase the Moon will be about 40% farther than now and in a synchronous rotation ("hantle rotation") with the Earth, meaning it will always be above the same location on Earth, like Pluto-Charon. But how would this be possible if the Moon wouldn't be in a geostationary orbit which is 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) above the Earth's surface?
