Are black holes spherical during merger?

I've been thinking about black holes, specifically during the final moments before two merge.  I'm wondering if black holes, or I guess more specifically their event horizons, are always spherical.  It seems to me that in the moments before two merge, their respective event horizons will be stretched, somewhat like how the Moon causes our ocean's tides. I have drawn a (poor) diagram of what I think they may look like.  Notice how the event horizons are closer to the singularity on the inner side, this is because the gravity from each black hole is in opposition.  The event horizons are further from the singularity on the outer side because the gravity from each black hole adds up.
