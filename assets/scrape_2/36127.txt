What symbol is used for the moon when doing calculations?

When doing calculations the mass and radius of the Earth can be represented by $M_{\oplus}$ and $R_{\oplus}$ respectively.
The planets all have their own symbols which can easily be found online.
But what about the Moon ?
Usually something like $M_â˜½$ is given but is that standard ? Are there other versions of expressing the moon ?
