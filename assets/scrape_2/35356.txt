How does energy (from fusion reactions still inside the sun) still have gravitational attraction?

In this answer they say:

While the conversion of mass matterâ€  to energy in the Sun's core now represents a loss of mass proper matter, it turns out that that energy (trapped in the Sun and slowly diffusing towards the surface) will have the same gravitational attraction as the matter it came from until it actually escapes the Sun!

Now I expect that when mass is converted to energy, it has become an electromagnetic wave that can propagate through matter or empty space. 
My question is: How does energy (from fusion reactions still inside the sun) still have gravitational attraction?
