Can we use atmospheric retrieval techniques on stars?

Although there are lots of examples of atmospheric retrieval techniques being used on exoplanets, and recently brown dwarfs, I can't find any mention of atmospheric retrieval techniques being used on stars. Is this because:
a) My research is bad and there are examples of this?
b) It's not useful as the structure and profile of stars are well known, as well as how to determine parameters e.g. metallicity by UV absorption?
c) Another reason?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
