How to find the the diameter of the moon during a total solar eclipse?

I am not able to find the diameter of the moon. I have the following question in my physics textbook:

During a total solar eclipse the moon almost entirely covers the sphere of the sun. Write the relation between the distances and sizes of the sun and moon.

Similar question from my textbook:

It is a well known fact that during a total solar eclipse the disk of the moon almost completely covers the disk of the Sun. ,determine the approximate diameter of the moon.

I have been provided the following information:

Earth-Moon distance = $3.84\times10^{8}m$
Sun-Earth distance = $1.496\times10^{11}m$
Sun's diameter = $1.39\times10^{9}m$
