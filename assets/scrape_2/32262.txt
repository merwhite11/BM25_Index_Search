Why can't we feel the Earth's revolution?

I googled it and checked a few Q&A and there's only things about "Earth's rotation". But why can't we feel the revolution?
They say we can't feel the rotation because the Earth spins at a constant speed. Okay, I get what happens for the rotation, but isn't it different when it comes to the revolution?

At night we feel the sum of speed of green and blue, whereas at day we should feel the sum of speed of green and minus blue, shouldn't we? In other words, shouldn't we feel the changes in velocity by times?
