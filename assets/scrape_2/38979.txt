Can you see both Jupiter and Saturn (and their moons) in detail during their upcoming conjunction?

In December of this year, Jupiter and Saturn are going to be in a conjunction. Are they going to be close enough that you could resolve both as more than just dots and see their respective satellites in the same FOV with a telescope?
