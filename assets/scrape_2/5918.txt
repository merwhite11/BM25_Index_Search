What is the time/size/rigidity ratio for a space object to become mostly round?

In the answer here multiple comets are identified that do not form a single round body.  
A drop of water will form a round shape in the time it takes to free fall a couple of feet.  
All of the moons and planets in our solar system are essentially round.
Based on observable data, I assume that there is a relationship between the size, rigidity and the passage of time; that will result in all objects subject to only their own gravitational influences (Given: no body is ever truly uninfluenced by others) becoming spherically shaped (round).  Any object that is in microgravity and not round, therefore must be either very rigid and/or very newly formed.  
What is the ratio or formula for calculating any one factor when the other two are known?   
Note There would be other factors as well, speed of rotation, elasticity and energy of areas moving in opposition.  But I think these (and others?) would be minor compared to the other three.
