Does cosmic inflation spawn from empty space, or vice versa?

In the eternal inflation model supported by Sean Carroll and others, the basic premise is that inflation is continuous in places across an infinite cosmos, and that bubble universes (like our own) are created when inflation suddenly ends at a specific point (what we call the big bang).
My question is one of parent/child relationship. Is inflating space the parent? That is, non-inflating space such as we see all around us can only come into existence from a localized ending of eternal inflation. Or, is non-inflating space the parent? That is, new inflating space could randomly occur at any time in some empty corner of an infinite cosmos, creating a new big bang and a new bubble universe.
I'm not asking "what is real?", I'm asking what is the proposal for the eternal inflation model.
