Where should I look at if I had a 25m parabolic radio reflector?

I am most interested in (exo)planets with atmospheres, see e.g. my question
Requirements to resolve position of Jovian Whistlers up to magnitude of Red Spot with amateur radio equipment?  So if I had a 25m radio dish in my backyard, would I have the chance to observe anything useful about (exo)planetary atmospheres by pointing it at one of the known exoplanets with atmosphere?
Another cool thing to observe would be a fast radio burst. Where should I point my reflector to increase the chance to see one?

In German, with some English summaries: Observations at Astropeiler Stockert until 2019, see also Wikipedia about Astropeiler which happens to be an amateur radio observatory with a 25m antenna. I am not associated with them (yet).
