Just how fast is a Fast Radio Burst thought to be?

According to Wikipedia's Fast Radio Bursts; Features are recorded they

The component frequencies of each burst are delayed by different amounts of time depending on the wavelength. This delay is described by a value referred to as a dispersion measure (DM). This results in a received signal that sweeps rapidly down in frequency, as longer wavelengths are delayed more.

The time between the arrival of the pulse at two different frequencies can be used to generate a kind of measure of distance, based on a dispersion constant. The measure does not have units of length, but of integrated electron density over the path from source to observer.
Using some fancy Fourier tricks one could first undo the $1/\nu^2$ delay and then try to reconstruct what the original pulse might have looked like before dispersion.
Has this been done? If so, how fast (narrow in time) might the original disturbance be? A millisecond? Less?
