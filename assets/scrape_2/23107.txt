Explaining gravity assist to a 6-year old

We've been talking about Cassini with my 6-year old daughter recently and I've mentioned that it picked up more speed by passing close to Venus (twice), Earth and Jupiter. But then, I've struggled to explain how did it pick up speed, why and how does it work.
How would you recommend to explain/demonstrate the concept of "gravity assist" to a 6-year old?
