Viewing 2017 Solar Eclipse - How important is it to be in the center(blue line)?

I'm viewing the 2017 Solar Eclipse in Graham County, NC.  How important is it to be in the center(blue line)?
It is almost entirely national forest there so it would be fairly easy to get to assuming I can park somewhere.
