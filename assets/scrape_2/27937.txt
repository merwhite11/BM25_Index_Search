Since gravity is like an indent on a piece of paper (the space/time matrix) to a marble, can the black hole eventually suck in the matrix?

Can a black hole suck in time? People claim that if you were to put a bowling ball on a trampoline and rolled much smaller balls through the deppression, some would stay in "orbit", some would roll through (if they were fast enough) and the others would just get stuck at the bottom. And if you put something that was heavy enough, the trampoline would snap. So could a black hole suck in the matrix??
