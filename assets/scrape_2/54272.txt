Could the revolution of super-massive black holes around each other create a pulsar-array gravitational wave signal despite 'final parsec' problem?

Some commentators on the recently-observed very-long-wavelength gravitational wave signal involving pulsars, like Dr. Becky Smethurst, have implied that it might not be merging supermassive black holes because they cannot (in theory, at least) get within a parsed or so of each other...
But these newly-discovered gravitational waves are extremely low frequency, so couldn't these not-that-close but massive SMBHs still create the signal?
