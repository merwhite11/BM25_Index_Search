How do you clean a foggy or dirty eyepiece of a telescope?

I'm wondering what the procedure would be to clean the eyepiece of a telescope when it looks foggy or there's dirt either on the outside or inside it.
I can get rid of loose dirt with a camel hair brush or air. But how can I clear foggy eypieces?
Or what should I do if somehow anything got into the eyepiece?
