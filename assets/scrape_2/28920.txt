Which side of earth will face toward sun when earth and sun will be get closer and be bonded by Gravitational Force?

We all know that one day the distance between the Earth and the sun will be zero. They will be bonded with gravity. My Question is which side of the earth will face toward the sun? I can't calculate that. Someone please calculate and don't say it's impossible.
