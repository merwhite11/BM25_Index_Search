How is dark matter different from ordinary (visible) matter?

How is dark matter different from ordinary (visible) matter?
1) Does dark matter consists of invisible astronomical objects like white dwarfs, black holes?
2) Has dark matter not been directly observed?
Is there a better explanation for dark matter. I could not understand completely the difference between dark matter and ordinary matter.
