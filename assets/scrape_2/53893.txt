Why does the tropical year have a ~161 years cycle?

Using PyEphem, I calculated the time difference between consecutive summer solstices in the south hemisphere for the last 4000 years, and plotted them in a graph. It seems like random noise around the mean, but the amplitude seems to oscilate with a period of around ~161 years. What explains this behavior?

Code used:
import ephem

date = ephem.Date("2023/01/01")
solstice = ephem.previous_winter_solstice(date)
for i in range(4000):
    previous_solstice = ephem.previous_winter_solstice(solstice)
    print(solstice - previous_solstice)
    solstice = previous_solstice
