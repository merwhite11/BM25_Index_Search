How can Hawking radiation consist out of photons?

It is assumed in some explanations that Hawking radiation origins in virtual particle pairs getting real near the horizon of a black hole (the tidal force tearing them apart). But how can this be when there are no virtual photon pairs (as the photon is its own anti particle).
Do the photons simply emerge from real particles and anti-particles annihilating each other? The difference with Unruh particles that Unruh particles are not real (or existing only at infinity which is basically the same)?
