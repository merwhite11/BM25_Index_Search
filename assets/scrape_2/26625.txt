How to calculate the angle formed between 2 planets?

I am interested in calculating the angles formed between planets like Saturn opposite to Neptune - 180 degrees, PlanetX opposite/trine/square to PlanetY. How to find such degrees?
I use Stellarium software to find positions of planets. Here I am adding positions of Saturn, Jupiter and Sun.



Stellarium shows information about selected objects, can it be used to calculate angle formed, for example, angle formed between Saturn and Jupiter taking Sun as reference point?
