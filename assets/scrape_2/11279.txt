Official Definition of Satellite?

So I had an argument with a friend, which was about whether the Moon is a planet or a satellite.
IAU 2006 Resolution B5 gives definitions on what it is to be a planet, but there is a vagueness, as I perceived, is that it does not define satellites, while using it to define dwarf planets.
There is a supplementary Q&A sheet, and it uses the barycenter to define a satellite, but it is implied, not explicitly defined.
My questions follow:

Should the supplementary Q&A sheet considered as legitimate official definitions, or should it be considered as a one way of interpreting the Resolution B5?
If Q&A is legitimate, then why is the definition of the satellite is not included in the Resolution B5? If not, is the official definition of the satellite nonexistent currently?
Are there any source or archive of the official or widely accepted definitions of glossaries in the fields of astronomy?
