Is it more accurate to measure distances from Mars?

I'm trying to figure out answer to this task:

At a certain level of development of the Martian civilization, scientists of this planet began to measure distances. Will their measurements be more or less accurate: a) to the planets of the solar system; b) to the nearest stars according to the measurements of earthlings? Consider that the development of the sciences of the terrestrial and Martian civilizations followed approximately the same path.

The Mars's orbit is only different from Earth's by being more elongated. Does it give some advantages?
