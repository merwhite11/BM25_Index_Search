What kinds of stars would it be possible to observe in M31 with a small amateur telescope?

I was wondering what kinds of stars would be visible in M31 and other nearby galaxies using a moderate (~8") telescope and a CCD camera. This would be a limiting magnitude of around 17.
I have heard of LBVs (Luminous Blue Variables). However, I would like to know what spectral class of stars would most likely be visible (would it be mainly OBA type stars)?
The context of this question is in the search for extragalactic transiting exoplanets. Current amateur detectors have the capability to detect planets with host star apparent magnitudes of 14. I was wondering if it might be possible to find exoplanets in M31, M33 or even the LMC/SMC with these limits. An advantage to searching for planets in M31 would be the very limited search region--an amateur astronomer would only have to perform photometry on the M31 region over several months or years to find a planet, rather than having to search a much larger region.
Are there any other issues with detecting transiting planets around very luminous stars? Would the percent dip in brightness be far less for a Jupiter sized planet? How would this affect our ability to detect extragalactic transiting exoplanets?
