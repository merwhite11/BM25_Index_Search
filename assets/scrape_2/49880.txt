What sort of exploratory procedures should be carried out on astronomical data?

Upon downloading an astronomical dataset such as SDSS DR12 from VizieR, what kind of exploratory techniques should be performed? I start with the basics, like this tutorial, and how much missing data there is
RA_ICRS         0
DE_ICRS         0
mode            0
q_mode       4679
class           0
SDSS12          0
m_SDSS12    20681
ObsDate         0
Q               0
umag            0
e_umag          0
gmag            0
e_gmag          0
rmag            0
e_rmag          0
imag            0
e_imag          0
zmag            0
e_zmag          0
spCl            0
zph             0
e_zph           0
<zph>           0
redshift        0
dtype: int64

then a pairplot between the magnitudes.

I can also do things like plot the sky distribution from the RA_ICRS and DE_ICRS columns, and a redshift distribution histogram.
Edit based on a comment:
My goal is to use a neural network to develop a photometric estimate of the redshift for the sources in SDSS12; that's why my first step was to plot mags vs mags as in the pairplot. I've also done each mag vs redshift.
What other exploratory investigations are worth doing on a new dataset?
