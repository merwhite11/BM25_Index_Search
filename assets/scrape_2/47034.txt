How will be changed Hill's radius and Kepler's formulas in case of 2D space instead of 3D?

Imagine that Flatland habitats go into space. All stars and planets are the circles instead of spheres and gravity law is $F=Gm_1m_2/R$ instead of $F=Gm_1m_2/R^2$.
How the other formulas will be changed in this case?
