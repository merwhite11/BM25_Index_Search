Are there many faint meteors that are too faint to see with the naked eye?

I remember one time a while back looking at the night sky through night vision goggles.  One interesting thing I noticed is that there appeared to be many very faint meteors in the sky practically all the time.  I assume this is dust burning up in the atmosphere, or possibly an unusual effect produced by the night vision goggles themselves.  I more suspect that it is dust burning faintly in the atmosphere because it was seen only in the sky.  My main question is: Is space dust constantly entering the atmosphere as small meteors at a fairly high rate?  If I remember right, it was a few every second, which is much more frequent than normal "brighter" meteors, even during a meteor shower.
