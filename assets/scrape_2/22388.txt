Generate a uniform distribution on the sky

How to generate a uniform distribution of stars on the sky ? What I want is make a simulation of random points following uniform distribution on a part of the sky (making the assuption that we have the same amount of stars in any direction). The problem is how I do that because of the cos(dec) on the RA ?
What I did in python is this
import numpy as np
RA = np.random.uniform(-180,180)
Dec = np.random.uniform(-90,90)

But it is totally false, since we will have more points on the poles (if I do many points, this will clearly not be uniform)...
Thanks a lot in advance!
