Why does matter stay collapsed in the core, following a supernova explosion?

Following a supernova explosion a star may turn into a white dwarf, neutron star, black hole, or just a stellar dust & gas leftover.
Excluding the latter case, why and how does the star's core matter stays collapsed, after such an event where matter is burst and scattered in space?
