How close would the sun have to get to a supermassive black hole to have Jupiter stripped and slingshot into interstellar space?

Please make whatever assumptions are needed.  Assume sun approaches black hole on some sort of hyperbolic trajectory.  Assume size of supermassive black hole is same as the one at center of our galaxy.  How close would sun have to get in order for Jupiter to be “slingshot” into interstellar space.
