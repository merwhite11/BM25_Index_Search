What will happen to life on Earth when the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies collide?

It is said that the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies are coming close to each other with a speed of approximately 400000 km/hour. They will be together in the next 4 billion years.

What will happen to life on Earth or human beings on Earth?
If we are about to collide in the next 4 billion years then how long before we should take action for interstellar voyage?
Are scientists working on such projects for an interstellar voyage?
Will we be able to get the something like Earth to go away from this galaxy/Earth/ solar system and, considering speed of human instruments/spaceships, how long will it take to go to a safe place?
