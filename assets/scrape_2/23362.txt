Calculate NEO object position with nasa Near Earth Object data

I wish to create a 3D visualisation of NEO's by date in relation to earth, but calculating their position at that time has got me stuck.
From this question I was able to fine Nasa's NEO object data:
Previous Question
Listing Of NEO's:
Nasa Date range NEO Data
Detailed NEO Data
Given the information in these JSON streams. Is it possible to calculate the position of the NEO in relation to earth? It doesn't seem to offer any positional information that I can see, although this is not my field.
Or is there a better data set which will assist me in this?
