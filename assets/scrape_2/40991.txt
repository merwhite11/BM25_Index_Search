Different approaches to quantify light pollution on a given location on Earth?

The question Light Pollution: what is the difference between artificial brightness and brightness and SQM made me wonder which different ways exist to directly and indirectly quantify light pollution at a given location on the Earth's surface? The obvious sources like Wikipedia etc. did not satisfiy my curiosity.
What I came up so far as a list of different methods is the following:

Look what you can observe with naked eye and use the Bortle scale.
Use a Sky quality meter of any kind and measure luminance.
Use the measurements of a pyranometer of your friendly metereologist or of an automatic weather station nearby and callibrate how many ${\rm W}/{\rm m}^2$ correspond to what value on the Bortle scale.
Use satellite data of any kind to obtain an approximate

If your urban area is bright enough, you could see that and in the visible spectrum of any weather satellite, and deduce a lower bound, i.e. how bright it must be at least on the ground.
The US's DOD might release maps from the Defense Metorological Satellite Program every now and then.



I am sure this list is not exhaustive - which other approaches am I missing?
