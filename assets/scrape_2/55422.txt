Is Venus' north towards Earth's south

Is Venus upside down? Does its north point in the same direction as Earth's south? (roughly) Or does it just spin clockwise and its north points towards Earth's north? (also roughly) It seems that the right-hand rule would point Venus north in the same direction Earth's south (roughly) but some have said Venus is not upside down, which I believe would mean Venus' north points (rougly) in the same direction as Earth's north.
