A beginner project in plotting celestial bodies in 3D coordinate space

As a data visualization task, I'd like to plot some celestial bodies in 3D coordinate space. I assumed there would be a lot of databases where celestial bodies are recorded along with an XYZ coordinate relative to our sun. As I ponder more on it I begin to realize other features, for example how is the axis of alignment achieved and agreed upon?
Given the below data set, is it clear what system is in use and how I may interpret it in a way that gives me an XYZ I can begin plotting?
