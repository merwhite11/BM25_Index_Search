Right ascension, Equinox, Positions Help

I am trying to answer the following question which I slightly understand but need a clearer explanation:
What are the times of year to observe an object at X hours of RA at visual wavelength?
I am trying to use the march equinox as a starting point for 0 RA and for a 12 hour RA object, it will begin to rise from the east as the sun sets west of course, around 6 months from the march equinox???
I appreciate an explanation and if you can link a map or a helpful visual as well. Thanks!
