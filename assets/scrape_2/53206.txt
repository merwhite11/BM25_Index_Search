How certain is the Sun's classification?

Curious Question here.
How do we know the Sun is a G-Type Star?
Our sun (Classed as G2V) apparently lies around the 5,780 Kelvin. Yet NASA generalizes it as 6,000 K- and is apparently white even though it's classed as a Yellow Dwarf.
The differences in classification seem pretty small compared to how the temperature of the Sun is (often) given:
G-type Stars range from 5,000 Kelvin to 6,000 Kelvin (Yellow/white)
F-Type Stars are 6,000 kelvin to 7,000 Kelvin which is also described as Yellow/white
Thus: How sure are we about the exact classification of our Sun as G2 dwarf? Are there more obvious differences between F and G type Stars?
