Do we get shortest shadow of any object at Solstice time or Meridian time?

Today is 21 June and I want to see at what time I will see shortest shadow in my location.
I am seeing two different times: Solstice time a d Meridian time.
I read that on summer solstice the sun is highest in sky. So I wonder shadow should be smallest at that time?
Following two images are of my location:


According to second image (visually) I should get shortest shadow on 12:33.
But solstice time is 14:33. So I am confused. Please help me understand.
