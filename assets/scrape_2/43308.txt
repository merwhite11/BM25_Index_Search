Did we adapt to Earth or Earth to us?

I often hear that Earth is a unique planet because it has life. We also see a proper balance between plants and humans and other animals. Why is life not possible on another planet? Often people say because the environment of other planets is so different from the earth and it's hard to find a planet like ours. That seems pretty satisfactory; I can not live on Mars or Saturn.
On the other hand, I find it little misleading. Why do we imagine ourselves on other planets to see if life is possible on other planets? There might be different creatures that are used to different environments. There might be creatures that are adapted to ${\rm H_2SO_4}$.
I have two questions. First is my reasoning true? And if so what makes life rare on other planets or makes the earth so unique?
