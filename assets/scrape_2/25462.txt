planets are point like

Need Help. I have a problem with my 50 mm objective with 500mm focal length refractor telescope. I can see moon clearly. I have 18 mm and 9 mm eyepieces.
I see Jupiter and Venus as a bright point when focused at 30x or 60x and I see white disk when out of focus. While I have successfully resolved double stars with it and I saw Pleiades star cluster clearly with it, I cant see the moons of Jupiter.
Should I buy 3x Barlow to see the bigger image? is low magnification is my problem? 
Or there is another solution to this problem.?
