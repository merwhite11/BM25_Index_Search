How can I get the fluxes of fetch_imaging_sample? - astroML

I'm working with astroML in Python and I need to get the fluxes from the magnitudes in r band of fetch_imaging_sample().
from astroML.datasets import fetch_imaging_sample
data = fetch_imaging_sample()
mag = data['rRaw'] # these are the magnitudes in r band
err = data['rErr'] # these are the errors in r band

How can I get the fluxes with their errors?
