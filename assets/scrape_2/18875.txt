Why don't we see "the milky way" in both directions?

We're (basically) in the middle of an arm of our galaxy. That is to say, we're sitting in the middle of a dense disc of stars.
It would seem to me that. You should see:
the thick line of the milky way all around you, i.e. on that plane, in all four directions.
(Additionally - sure - in the particular direction of the galaxy center, you would additionally see the huge central bulge.)
However: this does not seem to be the case: when you look at the milky way from the vicinity of our solar system, you basically see it "in one direction".
What am I misunderstanding?  How come the sky object "the milky way" is well-known as only a lump/strip in one direction, rather than, a lump/strip that goes right around us?

Put it this way...
Quite simply does anyone have any photography of the anti-galactic point?  (Near "Auriga" right?)  Does it show any "milky way band" going through it?
If not why not? Looking outwards, we are still looking through ~30k lightyears of the dense disk we are sitting in.
