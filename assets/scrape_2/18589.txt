Did the Juno mission locate Jupiter at the same precision as Saturn (4 km)?

Juno's low perijove should be great for measuring Jupiter's gravitational effect on Juno's orbit. Cassini together with VLBI has measured Saturn's location to within 4 km. 
Will Was Juno be able to be measured by VLBI to determine Jupiter's location and orbit at a similar precision? At a precision useful for mapping the Solar System outside of the Kuiper Belt?
