How could the universe be a few light years across just 1 second after the big bang?

I was skimming through Neil deGrasse Tyson's book Astrophysics for People in a Hurry when I noticed he says something curious on page 26:
"By now, one second of time has passed [since the big bang]. The universe has grown a few light years across."
How could the universe have expanded to a few light years in diameter in just one second if nothing can travel than light? By definition of a light year, wouldn't take a 1+ years for the universe to get this big?
