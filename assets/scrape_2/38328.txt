Impact on the rest of the solar system if Mercury or Venus were disassembled?

I've watched a few theoretical videos about Dyson spheres where they mention that the most practical way to do that would be to disassemble a planet - preferably one already close to the sun - Mercury or Venus.
Question: Would the solar system become completely unstable if one (or both) of those planets got disassembled? As a follow up question: what if one or more of the gas giants somehow were taken out of the solar system?
