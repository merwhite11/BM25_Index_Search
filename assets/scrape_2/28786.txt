What would the sun look like from aphelion of The Goblin's orbit?

I was amazed to find out about the discovery of The Goblin 2015 TG387 with an orbital period of more than 32 thousand years and a aphelion of more than 1955 AU! That is an astonishing distance. What would the sun look like from aphelion on The Goblin? Could a naked eye observer distinguish it from the rest of the sky?
