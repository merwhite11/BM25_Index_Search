Do satellites travel in groups

I’m new to this site after googling “do satellites travel in groups”. I read the discussion with posts from 2016 and 2019 and their descriptions did match what we (my wife and I) just witnessed minutes ago.
 I live in Dalhart Texas. We saw the event within 1 hour of sunset. We witnessed at least 15 objects but there could have been many more before we first saw them.
 As the previous comments stated, the objects we saw were also moving NW to SE. No blinking lights, no tell tale red or green lights. Solid light just like countless satellites I have seen before. Same steady pace but all in synchronized direction and speed. Not all were evenly spaced though. As they traveled SE they all slowly dimmed and disappeared all the same point in the sky. This must be the point at which the suns rays no longer reached the “satellites”. These objects appeared in the same relation to the moon as mentioned in a previous comment on this thread. 
 I’m a bit suprised there are so few related sightings posted here. If these “satellites” orbit the earth then there must be countless sightings. 
Thank you for your time
