Orbital decay via gravitational emission in a hypothetical, two-body universe

Assume we have a universe with nothing in it except for two objects. One of them is a stationary object that is perfectly spherical with the mass of the Moon (without any atmosphere, of course; also, let's call this Body A). The other body is a small satellite similar to the Hubble Space Telescope, orbiting at 100 miles (161 km) above the surface of Body A.
How long would it take for the satellite to crash into Body A via gravitational emission?
