Would a spacecraft just go "through" a gas giant?

From my understanding of the word gas giant, it is a planet composed of entirely a gaseous atmosphere, and so planets Jupiter and onwards fall in this category. 
That being said, what would stop a spacecraft from just going right through any of these planets?
For earth, a spacecraft would firstly rapidly disintegrate approaching the surface of earth, and if it happens to still have part of itself, it will collide with the surface.
For gas giants like Uranus, if a spacecraft is able to counter the gravitational forces and slow down, could it actually "go through" Uranus?
