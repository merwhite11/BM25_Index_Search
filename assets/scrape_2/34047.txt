line of lights across sky

This morning at 6AM I saw a line of lights coming out of Orion, moving across the North star then Big Dipper and disappearing into the early dawn.  I saw at least 30, no idea how many came before I noticed them.  They were not all evenly spaced, all moving at the same speed, very high, no sound. If these are Musk's satellites, why are they still sort of stacked, why are they moving in a NNE direction, and can I expect to see them again?
