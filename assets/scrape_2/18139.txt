What was the nature of the signal received from the direction of HD164595?

There's been a story in the news recently of a potential SETI candidate signal received from the vicinity of star HD164595.  What's the nature of this signal?  Is it a single pulse of energy, or does it change over time?  Can someone point me to a link or paper than shows it in more detail?
