How did ancient models explain 6 months of day and night at the respective poles?

We know that the Arctic circle experiences 6 months of continuous day light during the sun’s apparent northward journey (to the solstice) and vice verse for the Antarctic region. This is attributed to the tilt in the earth’s axis.
In the case of ancient models, the earth was not considered to be tilted and in some cases, not even a sphere (models before Ptolemy).
How then did these ancient models explain 6 months continuous sunlight and darkness at the respective poles?

 Note: If they said that the sun simply moved north or south to shine directly there, it doesn’t explain the fact that the climate up there would still be cooler than at the equator. So also, how did they explain the climate being cooler, yet accounting for the 6 months of day and night?
