Which redshift is used to determine the Hubbleconstant?

I think they measure cosmological redshift to use in the Law of Hubble-Lema√Ætre together with the distance to calculate $H_0$. Is this correct, or do they use Doppler shift (too)?
$H_0$ indicates how fast the universe is expanding, so I find it logical that we measure cosmological redshift. But the galaxies are receding (due to the Hubble Flow) away from us, so do they gain an additional Doppler shift?
