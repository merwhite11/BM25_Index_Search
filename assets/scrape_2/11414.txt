Before Voyager 2, what were the highest quality photos of Uranus and Neptune?

I'm in search of historical knowledge of the outer ice giants, which seems so hard to come by. Right now I would be happy with just a photo of each, the best photo we had of them before Voyager 2. Such a photo from the 60's to early 80's would be great. This will almost surely be from the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory, because it's 5 meter primary mirror was the biggest for a long time.
Note: I'm not entirely sure that Neptune would even be a resolvable disk, but nevertheless I still want to see what our best photo of it (from that time) would be.
After googling this for so long, I've come to the conclusion that the best bet would be old astronomy books, which sadly, I do not have. Maybe someone here can help me out.
