Is an "observation campaign" well recognized thing in Astronomy? Is it self-declared? Are there standard ways to announce or coordinate?

The Astronomy meta question Should we have an observation-campaign tag and what is good usage advice for it? lists about 13 example questions where the tag might apply. There are several answers that evoke the term here as well, but tags go on questions (primarily).

My understanding is that it is anything between a rally for amateur observers to try to photograph something to a highly coordinated and preplanned observing plan for ground and space observatories and facilities, but that's just my impression.

A "star party" is not an observational campaign because the primary goals are outreach, fun, and general Astronomy education. A campaign would be a targeted and to some extent coordinated effort, at least to the extent that it was announced and described ahead of time. It could certainly involve amateur astronomers or even the public, but it would still presumably have at least some research or scientific goal,

Is it self-declared? Do people just come up with them and announce them?
