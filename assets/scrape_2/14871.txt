At what depth on Mars would the atmosphere have equal pressure of that on Earth?

I know the atmospheric pressure on Mars is less than that of Earth, and so is its gravity.  However, I know that the deeper you go (e.g. in a cave or a hole that is dug), the more atmospheric pressure you would experience.  How deep would you have to go on Mars (e.g. below the surface) for the atmospheric pressure to be equal to the pressure we experience on the surface of the earth?
