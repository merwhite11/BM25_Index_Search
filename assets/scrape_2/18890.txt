Why don't we use amateur astronomers' telescopes to create a huge interferometer?

Some telescopes in space have been proposed to function as an interferometer. 
Being placed several hundreds or thousands of kilometers apart they could actual image exoplanets directly. To my knowledge none of these space telescopes have yet been deployed.
So I was wondering why we don't connect all the several thousand amateur telescopes on Earth together to create a huge interferometer?
That sure would require some efforts (especially software to coordinate it all) but compared to sending telescopes into space it seems outright simple.
Are amateur telescopes simply not strong enough, even when linked together? What would be the best we could achieve?
