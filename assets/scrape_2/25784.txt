Brightest star visible from Italy and Argentina

A friend of mine tends to ask crazy question about everything. Today he ask me what is the brightest star that is visible on both the hemisphere and in particular from Italy and Argentina. I tried to ask wolframalpha but nothing came up. Thanks in advance.
