Is there an orbit that could cause regular debris showers like in the movie Gravity?

[some spoilers]
If you were in the ISS and orbiting the Earth roughly every 90 minutes, would it be possible for debris to be orbiting such that it passes you every 90 minutes?
While Neil DeGrass Tyson pointed out scientific flaws in the movie on twitter, he praised many things the movie got right in interviews, including "The 90-minute orbital time for objects at that altitude."  I think I recall an interview on a podcast that I can't remember where he specifically said that referring to the debris recurring every 90 minutes.
In reality wouldn't the debris have to be in a different orbit?  If the ISS orbits every 90 minutes (92.87 really but I'm saying 90) then after 90 minutes they would be in the same relative position.  The Earth would have rotated in the mean time so they wouldn't be over the same point on Earth, but they would be in the same position in orbit about the Earth.  Is there an orbit that would allow the same debris to cross the same spot in their orbit every 90 minutes?  Would it be nearly the same orbit, just inclined slightly?  Would that explain why the debris was moving so slowly relative to the ISS as well?
note:
There are problems with the orbits and location in the movie, I simplified my question to ask about the particular orbit of the ISS.
