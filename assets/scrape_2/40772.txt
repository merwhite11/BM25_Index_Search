Will 1036 Ganymed's orbit be changed by its close encounter with Mars in 2176?

In 2176, the asteroid Ganymed will come as close as 0.02868 AU (4,290,000 km / 2,670,000 mi) from Mars. That's pretty close to Mars imho. Can Mars' gravity alter Ganymed's orbit significantly in 2176 and if so, how much would it change? Just curious. Ganymed is a near-Earth object after all, and one at global killer size.
