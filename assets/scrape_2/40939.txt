Abundance of penitente ice formations in the solar system

When researching for my question on extraterresitral snow, I learned about a rare snow formation called penitente which seems to be found on various (dwarf) planets, like Earth, Mars, and Pluto. Interestingly, these spike-like structures are an important place for life in extreme environments (on Earth) as shown by a study 2019 of penitentes in the Adnes, but this is not what I after.
My question: How abundant are penitentes in our solar system? Are they any estimates in terms of area covered or total ice volume present as penitentes per planet? I would also be interested in actual pictures of extraterrestrial nieves penitentes (including the image source).

The Reference list of the Wikipedia article already offers a nice reading list, but I feel the list is far from exhaustive. What I found worth bookmarking:

A blog by Yurong Yu from February 2017 served me as a starting point.
There is an 2019 article by T. Giang Nguyen, Christina L.Smith, Alexandra Innanen and John E. Moores called
Simulating the formation of Martian penitentes
The same John E. Moores published meeting notes called Penitentes at Tartarus Dorsa, Pluto.
