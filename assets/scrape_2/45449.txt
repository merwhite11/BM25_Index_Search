Where can I find planetary rotational axis direction?

I can find axial tilt of planets easily, but that doesn't specify the direction of that tilt, i.e. planet's rotation axis may be anywhere in circle defined on a sphere by axial tilt value. And I can't google for obliquity direction as it only gives me obliquity value, not it's direction. Even NASA's HORIZONS only gives obliquity value. I expect there should be another angle, either from main body equinox, Earth's equinox, ascending node or maybe periapsis, that with axial tilt and orbital elements would define direction of planet's rotation axis. I know that the rotation axis  precesses, but that takes thousands of years, and compared to time from J2000 it's practically neglectable (or at least it's easier to find precession rate and make a correction for it, knowing some starting value).
