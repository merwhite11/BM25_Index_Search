Why do nebulae turn into accretion disks but planets do not?

What are the factors that prevent planets from also turning into disks, like the stellar dust in a nebula does?
The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but rather it's squished at the poles and it bulges at the Equator, owing to its rotation working to squish it into a disk.
I'm tempted to say that the Earth couldn't become a disk because of the density of the material in it fighting back against being pressured into a disk in a way that in stellar gas you can't? But then, why isn't the gas around the gas giants a disk? Is it because of the solid nucleus of those planets fighting against that?
