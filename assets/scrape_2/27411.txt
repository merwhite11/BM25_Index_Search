Were all first generation stars of same mass and size?

If the density of the matter from which the first generation stars were made was homogeneous, so during the star formation nuclear fusion would have started around when they all reached to same critical mass and core temperature, once fusion started the outward pressure would have counteracted on inflow of matter so all stars should have been of similar size
