Astronomical animations of deep space objects

Is there any real animations from NASA or others (not simulation or Artist's impression) like this 
https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a004400/a004442/frames/730x730_1x1_30p/ 
or this 
https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a004000/a004038/frames/4096x4096_1x1_30p/304A-Frames/
for deep space objects like galaxies, nebula, Binary star, etc?
Or it is really not possible to get animation, because it is too far and everything is looks very slow from earth?
Because whatever I found so far is only solar system animations (planets, moon, Sun, etc), software simulation or Artist's impression.
