Sun traveling North & South in this graphic?

"CBS This Morning" showed this graphic for the 2024 Eclipse that will be seen from America.
I would have expected a solar eclipse to follow an East to West path across the USA since, at least in Maryland, the sun travels east to west in the sky.  Yet, the graphic has a strong North/South trajectory.
I was thinking this might be the path of the moon, but wouldn't the moon have to share a path with the sun during an eclipse?
Obviously I am wrong as demonstrated by this graphic, but I cannot see the error in my thinking.  Can one of you explain why there is such a strong North/South trajectory during an eclipse?
To move the shadow of the moon on earth north to south, I am thinking that the sun would have to move north or south.   See the red arrows.   That is impossible.   So why is the eclipse traveling south.
