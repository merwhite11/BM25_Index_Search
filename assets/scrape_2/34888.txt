Could a star have a Saturn-like ring?

Saturn's rings will never clump together, because they are within the Roche limit. Which makes me wonder if a star could have rings that are kept from clumping together due to tidal forces. Have any ring systems been observed within the Roche limit of other stars?

The answers to this question consider rings in a more general sense. I would like to know specifically about rings around a star that exist due to the same mechanism as Saturn's rings.
