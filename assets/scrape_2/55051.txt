Would it be possible to use existing radio-telescopes to do spot measurements of CMB?

With CMB peaking at roughly 158GHz would it be possible to create a more precise map of CMB just by sampling 'points' using existing Earth-based radio telescopes? I understand that large dish parabolas should provide a much sharper angular resolution. Why is this not being done?
