How do telescopes avoid blurry images?

Telescopes rotate with the Earth. If a telescope isn't fixed on something like the North Star then everything in its field of view is moving pretty rapidly, yet photos from these devices are crystal clear.
I'm very curious how these are taken. The light from distant galaxies is extremely faint - and they must be whizzing by given their relatively minuscule size in the sky. I've been googling this but either I'm asking a very dumb question or it's not easy to find an explanation online.
