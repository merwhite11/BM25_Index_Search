During night on the Moon is there Earth light and Earth phases?

I realise that night time on the Moon is two weeks, however I am curious if during the night there, whether or not the Earth reflects light in similar manner to the Moon. 
On the one hand, I know it must (as seen in photographs from astronauts), but what I'm really wanting to know is:
Does the Earth have phases like the Moon and do they work in a similar manner for an observer on the Moon?
I assume the Earth isn't as reflective as the Moon since the Moon is much lighter in colour, however the Earth is also fairly larger, does this make any difference in the amount of light reflected?
Finally, if the Earth does appear in phases, does that mean that the two week long nights on the Moon are sometimes pitch black (new Earth) and sometimes less than pitch black (full Earth)?
