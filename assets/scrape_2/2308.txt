Would space-faring vehicles in interstellar space be in pitch darkness, show reflections from the nearest star or be bathed in light completely?

This is not a science fiction question, but I was considering the visual accuracy of ships in space depcicted in Battlestar Galactica and the like. They are always strongly lit. 
If they are in between stars, would they be visible at all or bathed in light equally on all sides?

Pursuing it further, at what distance from a star does an object no longer reflect it's light as the dominant light source and after that is it dark?
