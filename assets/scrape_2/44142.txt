Star Constellations: The Zodiac

I am trying to track down the original artist for the Zodiac diagram found here. I would like to obtain permission to use
the diagram as an illustration in an astronomy book I have written.
The diagram can be found at many locations on the web, but, as far as I can tell, none of them claim copyright nor mention the diagram's original creator.
The link above appears to point to the earliest version. It is on the blog of Peter Christoforou, but there is no contact information for him listed there.
Does anyone have information that would help me track down the source of this diagram?
