What is the right ascension overhead at Greenwich at noon on 21 march

My question is seen in the title: What is the right ascension overhead at Greenwich at noon on 21 march
I'm a little bit confused since the right ascension is set by the vernal equinox and don't understand how this is related to Greenwich.
