How Well Can I See the Surface of Jupiter Using Natgeo 76/700 EQ Telescope?

I have been trying to see surface features on the disk of Jupiter with my Natgeo 76/700 EQ1 but it does not appear to be too clear. So I was wondering:

What kind of image I should expect from this telescope?
If my experience doesn't match expectations, what are some likely reasons?
