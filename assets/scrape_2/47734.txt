If Theia did collide with Earth, would it have produced rings? If so, would we expect to still see at least some remnants today?

Before I get into the actual question, I'll just specify two things:

Few billion years ago, a planet as big as Mars named Theia, is hypothesized to have crashed into the Earth, leading to the formation of the Moon.
When an asteroid or moon, passes the Roche Limit, it breaks apart and forms rings around the primary body.

These two things got me thinking,

If the event happened, and Theia passed the Roche Limit (because it did crash into earth), then would it have lead to the formation of rings of the Earth?
If so, would we expect to still see at least some remnants today?

Different but related questions about Theia and the Giant Impact Hypothesis:

Why Earth does not have rings?
If Theia really crashed into Earth, did it impact Earth's axial tilt?
What is Earth believed to have looked like before the collision with Theia?
What was earth's mass before the collision with theia?
Does the Giant Impact Hypothesis explain how the Moon circularized its orbit?
