Why does the Moon appear to be flat?

There's no way around it: when I look at the full moon at night it looks like a mostly flat disc, with at most a bit convexity in the middle. Phases of moon look like a full moon seen through a cut-out.
Why is that the case? I recall, when I was really young, looking at it through what at the time seemed to be a very strong telescope, and it appeared not only a lot more textured but also a lot rounder. A similar thing can be seen in a video I saw a couple months ago, at 2:05: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCrJ3NflOpE . So it's clearly a naked eye thing.
I presume it's related to the optics, which made me hesitant to post it on this stack exchange (thinking it might be more suited to the physics one), but chose against it presuming people here would have more experience with celestial bodies and "large" distances.
I have a hunch that the answer is very simple, but I really don't know what that might be, especially since it's done over what I view as large distances.
