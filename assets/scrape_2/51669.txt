What's the simplest evidence for Kepler's first law?


What is the simplest explanation that provides enough evidence for the first Kepler law?

i.e. that planets around the Sun travel on ellipses with the Sun at one of the two foci.

Are the three Kepler laws valid in every planetary system with planets moving around a star (not necessarily being the Sun)?
