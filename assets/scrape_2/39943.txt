Unit problem regards to proton

In a textbook, we have an example:

The density of matter in the interstellar medium is of order one
proton per ${\rm cm^3}$, then the total mass of the interstellar
medium is of order (The $10^6$ term accounts for the number cubic
centimetres within one meter cubed). \begin{equation} m=1\times
V_\text{galaxy}\times m_\text{P}\times
10^6=3.3\times10^{40}{\rm kg}\approx 17 \cdot 10^9 M_{\odot}
> \end{equation}

So I was wondering, should the unit of the equation be:
$\frac{{1}}{{\rm cm^3}}\times{\rm m^3}\times{\rm kg}$?
And what exactly should be the unit of proton in the formula? Should it be unitless? Or ${\rm kg}$? Thank you.
