Sundial terminology

My homeschoolers are studying the sun & time.   We have set up a fence post to create a shadow and we are using it with experiments I found on the web to track the sun.
What we cannot find is information on how to reference points on a sundial other than solar noon.  What are the other points of time on the sundial called?  We purchased the sundial below.  Roman numerals aside, the sundial has clear markings on it for various times.  However, it does not appear to match a clock face as it has 17 reference points, not the expected 12.
Not being able to read the sundial face is proving frustrating.  For instance, my little experimenters want see the difference a tracked shadow makes taken at the same watch-time vs. the same solar time.
So I am looking for how to properly read and reference the points of time on a sundial face.  For example, let us say the shadow is pointing to the position I have drawn.  What "sundial" time is that.
