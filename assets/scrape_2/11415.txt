Why are there no stars on New Horizons images of Pluto

I followed the New Horizons Mission a little, and saw among others this image of Pluto:

I wonder, why you can't see any stars on it. As far as my very basic knowledge in astronomy goes, I think you can even see stars during a "Sun-Moon-Eclipse" here on earth. So besides having here a spectacular "Sun-Pluto-Eclipse", I further more ask myself if that eclipse is even necessary to see other stars, as those pictures are already taken quit far away from sun, and outside an atmosphere.
Is that not enough to see stars? Or does NASA remove the stars from the images, before publishing them? (If so, why? Not to distract?)
Thanks for answers!
