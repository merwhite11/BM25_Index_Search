How much lighter would someone be on the Jupiter-facing side of Io?

Io is the Galilean moon closest to Jupiter. Its average surface gravity is 0.183g and it has a tidal lock with Jupiter. So if you stood on the near side of Io at the equator, how much lighter would you be compared to average (say you weigh 18.3 pounds on Io, how much would you weigh due to Jupiter's gravity on Io's near side)? Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, this is why I think you'd be quite lighter on Io's near side on the equator.
