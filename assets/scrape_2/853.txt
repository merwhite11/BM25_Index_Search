How would Earth's climate differ if it's axis were tilted around 90 degrees like Uranus?

As the title states, what would the effect on Earth's climate be if it's axis were tilted approximately 90 degrees like Uranus?  
I'm specifically wondering about the effects on seasons, temperature, and life on Earth.  However, I'm happy to hear about other effects as well.
