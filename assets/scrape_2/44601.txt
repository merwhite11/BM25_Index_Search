Are there non-rotating objects in the universe?

All celestial bodies I can think of rotate. The sun, the planets, the moon, the galaxies, clusters of galaxies, the supermassive black hole at the center if the Milky Way, accretion discs, etc. It would be very strange if they didn't. They couldn't even exist.
Are there examples of non-rotating bodies? I can find no funamental reason why such an object can't exist. Maybe a planet or two stars that have had a tangential encounter.
