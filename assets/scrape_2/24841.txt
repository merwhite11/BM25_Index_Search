If the Universe is Flat, why does it look 3D from our View?

So I know that the universe is flat in a 4D point of view, but what about a 3D point of view? The universe does not SEEM flat from our view, so how can it really be so? Please answer more simple, im not an astronomy pro.
Sorry if this is a dumb question, I don't have a degree in astrophysics or anything, i'm just a kid who is really interested in the universe, so i'm sorry (in advance) if this is a simply answered bad question.
