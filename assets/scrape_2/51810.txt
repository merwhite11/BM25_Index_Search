Why is the solstice the first day of summer, and not the central day?

Summer in the Northern Hemisphere starts on the day of the summer solstice. This is the day that the Northern Hemisphere receives more light from the Sun, due to the Earth's tilt. To my knowledge, the amount of light we receive is related to the temperatures that we have. That's why summer is the warmest period in most regions of the Northern Hemisphere.
Then, shouldn't the solstice be the central day of the summer instead of the initial day? That way, summer would be constituted by the days of the year when more light is received in the Northern Hemisphere, which is related to the higher temperatures in practice.
