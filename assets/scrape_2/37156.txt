How many solar masses is the central black hole in the Whirlpool Galaxy?

I am having trouble finding the mass of the central black hole in the Whirlpool Galaxy M51a/NGC5194, it is stated that its companion galaxy NGC5195 has a supermassive black hole at its centre that is 19 million solar masses but I can't find details on the Whirlpool Galaxy's central black hole, is its mass known?
