Are there negative masses that attract each other but repel positive masses?

Is there law/rule in physics that precludes the existence of a negative mass, wherein similar negative masses attract but positive and negative masses repel?
To keep this on-topic in Astronomy SE: Has this ever come up in the context of Astronomy? Do cosmologists consider the possibility? Has anyone looked for signs of negative mass, perhaps on galactic scales?
