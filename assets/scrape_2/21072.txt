"What was that spot in the sky?" - How to identify satellites

Yesterday, May 22nd 2017, I removed the telescope from its dusty box1 and decided to watch Jupiter. After about 2 minutes of observation I spotted something across the sky [X-files music in background], it was a little less bright as Jupiter's "Galilean" moons2.
Below you can see an accurate [Windows Paint] reconstruction of the fact I saw in my telescope. The red line indicates the direction of the thing (from right to left outside of the telescope).

Available data to help identify the object:
Time: May 22nd, 2017 @ 22:12 UTC
My position: {
    Lat: 41.720194062015096
    Long: 12.713427287843729
    Sea level: 540 m
    }
Direction: Probably South // The direction of Jupiter from that location at that time (didn't have a compass)
Telescope: {
    Focal length: 700 mm
    Diameter: 60 mm
    Lens: H 20 mm
    }

I only have data of the ISS and Iridium insights on an Android app3 so I am here to ask if there is some tool with which I can identify by myself as many satellites as possible across the sky.
Notes:

Winter is not nice with observers from here
Not visible at naked eye
I can almost certainly say that the "thing" was not the ISS or one of the Iridium satellites

P.s: I will post here what the object was (with reference if possible) as soon as I identify it for curious people like me.
