Could the universe have evolved differently?

Given the initial conditions at the Big Bang, could our universe have evolved any differently? In other words, did the initial conditions predetermine every stage in the evolution of the universe to this day, or - if we "roll the tape backward" and play it again - could the universe be entirely different on the macro scale (eg. no stars and galaxies)?
