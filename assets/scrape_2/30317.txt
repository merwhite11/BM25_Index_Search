M87 Black hole. Why can we see the blackness?

So, as the title states, why are we able to actually see the 'blackness' of the black hole? I get that what we are actually seeing is the event horizon, or accretion disk. But should this not extend all the way round? Surely the black hole is not a 2D thing so we can "look into it from above" (I use that term loosely as obviously there are no directions in space!), so why are we able to actually see the blackness?
The only thing I can think of is that a black hole, much like our solar system has some sort of ecliptic, that the vast majority of matter is orbiting, and everywhere else just doesn't have enough matter for the light to be visible, kind of like why we are unable to see the Oort cloud. 
I hope that made sense, and I could be way off, but it is the only thing I could think of to explain it. If it is the case, then would we be able to get a similar image of Sagittarius A, seeing as we could be in this "ecliptic" of it, so surely we would only be able to see the heated matter around the event horizon and not the blackness?
