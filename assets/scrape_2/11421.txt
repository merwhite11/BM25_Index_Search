Is it possible to create a traditional clock solar system?

Is it possible to create the following system of satellites?:

Place a satellite that orbits the some object X, once per day. Call it D.
Place a satellite that orbits D, once per hour. Call it H
Place a satellite that orbits H, once per minute. Call it M.
Place a satellite that orbits M, once per second. Call it S.

If possible, what are some values for the weights, rotational speed, and radii that would work?
Also, does the universe have a limit on how many layers of satellite systems it permits?
