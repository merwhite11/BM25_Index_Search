What should I improve my telescope kit to see more details of Moon?
I have the gskyer telescope of 60mm aperture and 350mm focal length.
my eyepieces are 10mm,25mm. 
and I have x3 Barlow.
my best viewing of the Moon when I combine the Barlow with 10mm eyepiece.
I want to see deep details of the moon, by the way, this helps me to zoom in more for the planets like Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
any help?
