Resources on planetary stability

I am a fifth (and last) year undergraduate student in Physics with good level of Mathematics formation and basic Astrophysics formation. I recently read some theories about Solar System formation and evolution and became interested in planetary stability, but I couldn't manage to get a good introduction to the topic.
I was wondering if there is a standard book or resource that approach this topic with precision that you could recommend. Any advice will be welcome.
