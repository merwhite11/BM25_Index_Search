How do people of the opposite side see the Moon and the Sun?

I was looking in the StarTracker android application from Tehran, Iran; and this is the screenshot:

As you can see the Moon covers a small portion of the Sun. The green line above them is the astronomical horizon and the two objects are located at NW direction.
I don't know if it's accurate. But how do people on the opposite side of the Earth (if we draw an imaginary straight line twoards the Sun from my location) see the Moon and the Sun if we assume the location of the objects are accurate on the app?
