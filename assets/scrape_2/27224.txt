Perseid Meteor Shower Viewing events near Chicago

I'm going to be in Chicago during the weekend of Aug 11th, 2018. Can you suggest any viewing parties that are not too far away? 
I'm very very amateur. I don't really know too much about astronomy, but do like being around people that do. 
Please post any events that you know of like this one that was one about an hour away at Indiana Dunes State Park. https://www.trippy.com/a/5b65a86ae4b0e99fd1765e1b/507c527fe4b0c31db879944f
