Scientifically important discoveries with the help of amateurs

I am looking for examples where amateur astronomers in these days contributed sigificantly to important scientifically discoveries.
I am aware of one example: Victor Buso from Argentina was lucky enough to observe a Supernova just when it formed, which has led to follow-up observations by large scientific observatories, and in the end resulted in a Nature article which has Buso as a co-author. 
What might some other similar examples be?
