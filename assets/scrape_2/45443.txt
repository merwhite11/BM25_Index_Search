What is the bright star that never seems to move and sometimes the only star in sky?

I have very little astronomy background; so apologies in advance with elementary terminology with this question. I am located in Northeast Pennsylvania and no matter what time of night 7pm, 1am, 5am there is a very large and bright star/planet that is always in the same spot, it does not move. Some nights there is not a star in the sky except this one. I was confused by this because I thought the stars moved, or seemed to move with us moving? It's always in the same spot and and is much larger and brighter then the rest. Almost looks like there is sections or compartments to the star? The few people that I know that has any astrology background said it's probably a satellite but when I showed them they were stumped too.
I used the star app and it said it was the star that you can sometimes witness go dim to bright, which I was lucky enough to witness. However the star moved later on in the app but was still in the same spot in the sky?
If anyone has any thoughts or have seen the same thing.... Please Help. Thanks guys
