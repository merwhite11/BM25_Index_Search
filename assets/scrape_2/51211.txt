Can a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ2000 be attached to a Celestron StarSense Explorer DX 130AZ

We recently bought a Celestron StarSense Explorer DX 130AZ for our children and we like to take some pictures of what we are seeing through the telescope. We know that's a beginner telescope and not really made for astrophotography, but we wonder if it's possible to attach our Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ2000 camera to the eyepiece somehow. The camera can take a lenshood and I wonder if it's possible to put this end to the eyepiece somehow (to hold it still during some seconds of exposure).
Any advice on this would be awesome and additionally recommondations for useful equipment like a barlow lens or filter for viewing the sun, moon and planets would be nice.
