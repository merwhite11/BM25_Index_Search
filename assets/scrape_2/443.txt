I live in an area with a lot of light pollution, how can I view the stars without building an observatory?

I live in an urban area with a lot of light pollution and very little garden space. On a clear night I can see most of the sky and the brighter stars are visible.
I can't build an observatory - I don't have the space (let alone the money required) - so what can I do to minimise the effects of light pollution so I can see more of the fainter stars and planets?
