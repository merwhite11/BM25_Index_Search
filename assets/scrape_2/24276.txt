If we could travel far enough would we be able to see a constelation in reverse?

I am enjoying Orion high in the sky this winter as always. I wondered if I could travel beyond it, say 2730 light years* and turn around, would I see Orion in reverse? If so, what of the neighboring constellations. I know brightnesses would be different but would I recognize the shape?
Happy new year to all.

I chose this number because Alnilam is 1360 light years away so I doubled the distance.
