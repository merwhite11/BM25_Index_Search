Do the Sun's rays get focused at or near the L1 Lagrangian point?

I have seen so many schematic pictures of eclipses (solar and lunar), and in all of them, the Sun's rays are focused at a specific point (left of the Earth in lunar eclipses and a slightly left of the moon in solar eclipses, or In other words, a slightly left of the Moon's orbit in both cases).

I'm guessing this is near the L1 Lagrangian point.
Based on the picture in Wikipedia, the gravitational waves are denser at the Lagrangian points. So maybe these waves cause the photon beams to bend and to focus?
