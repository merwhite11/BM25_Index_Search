Conditions on Hot Jupiters

Hot Jupiters are close to their parent star - after all, that's why they're so hot. Their atmospheres are thought to be slowly blown away by the parent star, and they will eventually become chthonian planets.
Are there any other effects on Hot Jupiters because of their proximity to their parent star? Examples I'm looking for include issues with solar flares or coronal mas ejections, or even difficulties relating to the solar wind. I would also be tangentially interested in any effects the parent star would have on moon formation (or lack thereof).
