How much does being at the perihelion heat Earth up?

The author in this article: https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/07/100707-aphelion-heat-wave-earth-sun-science-weather-nation/ has explained that positional differences on the orbit is a negligible factor - about 7% more sunlight at the perihelion compared to the aphelion. I suppose the explanation is relatable to people in the Northern/Southern hemispheres, where temperatures are driven by changing seasons.
However, for people in the equator, where daily temperature swings measure only in a matter of few degrees all year round, it would have definitely made some difference. Does anyone know if this temperature change has been investigated before? I would like to read up more about it. Thanks!
