How to adapt small Dobsonian to use with a tripod?

I am the owner of a small 4", f/6.3 tabletop Dobsonian telescope with a 102mm aperture and 640mm focal length. 
It is based on a Dobsonian mount but I would like to use a tripod instead because of the complications of having to cary a table with me everywhere I would like to use the telescope. The alternative is to but the telescope on the ground which makes viewing uncomfortable and is not very stable.
A good tripod could be foldable or collapsible and make my rig much more portable and bring the eyepiece up to a more convenient viewing height, without having to bring along a "telescope table". 
Is this possible? If so, are there any specific tripods I should use or other pointers on how best to proceed?

This is not me or my telescope or mount, but it gives an idea of viewing with a similarly-sized tabletop telescope. I'd like to mount the telescope on a tripod instead.
