Bright out north Idaho

It is Oct 9th 10;30- 11:00 pm. I'm in Northern Idaho and it is as bright as it would be with a full moon (or brighter). The moon is going to be new in a few days and the sliver as it is won't be out for hours. I live in my motorhome right now and it is usually so dark I need a flashlight to walk 10ft to my car. It is really weird. Kind of eerie. Any reason why? Thank you
