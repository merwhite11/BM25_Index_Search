At what annual rate are new exoplanets being recognized? How does it compare to new asteroids?

I just read the BBC News article Exoplanet tally set to pass 4,000 mark
. It makes me wonder about the annual rate  that new exoplanets being recognized, and how it compares to the rate of new asteroids.
I'm also wondering if there is any chance there will be a crossover in the rates in the next few years. TESS has found it's first exoplanet, and hopefully WFIRST will be on schedule as well.
