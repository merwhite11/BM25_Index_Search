What is "class 4 light pollution" and could I estimate my own area's class visually?

This question currently asks

I am living in the northern hemisphere in Greece and in class 4 area (light pollution scale).Is it possible to see the Andromeda galaxy with a naked eye?

I'd never heard of a light pollution scale before. How does the scale work, and if I wanted to gauge or estimate my own area, can I do that by looking at objects in they sky visually?
