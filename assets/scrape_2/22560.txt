Mountains on the moon during solar eclipse?

I ask myself the reason of why the sun in not uniform on the edge of the moon at this moment of the eclipse (cf. picture) is not unifom is because of the mountains of the moon ? Or can it due to erruptions of sun ? If not is there another reason to explain that ?
