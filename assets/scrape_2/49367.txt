Is the scaling in this composite photo of the moon and the Andromeda galaxy reasonably correct?

SEE BJV EDIT BELOW.
I came across this image which purports to show what the size of the Andromeda galaxy would be in the night sky if we could see its dim stars with the naked eye. Is this image reasonably correct with respect to size?

EDIT BJV 08-23-2022: A friend asked me 'So... where is Andromeda anyway and what would it look like if I could see it all?" I was at a loss to explain in terms he would totally grasp.
AND SO MY ASK... could somebody with the right combination of competencies create an image showing Andromeda (in its entirety) in the night sky in its correct location between Cassiopeia and Pegasus with trees/hills/buildings/whatever in the image to give a real sense of normal viewing scale??
Extra credit... provide same image with 'unaided human eye under IDEAL conditions'.
