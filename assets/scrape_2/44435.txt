When will 2002 MS4 be named?

The trans-Neptunian planetoid 2002 MS4 is currently the largest known unnamed Sun-orbiting object. Is there any standard schedule on when this and similar objects might be named? Usually the discoverers propose the names for the celestial body, which Chad Trujillo and Michael Brown obiously haven't. In that case, what will happen?
