Determining effect of small variable force on planetary perihelion precession

Is there an analytical technique for determining the effect of a small variable transverse acceleration upon the rate of aspides precession (strictly not a precession but rotation of the line of aspides) of a planet orbitting around the Sun in a 2D plane according to Newtonian gravity law?  
I have modelled such effects in a reiterative computer model and would like to verify those measurements.  
The transverse acceleration formula is 

$$At = (K/c^2)*Vr*Vt * Ar.$$

Where:-

c is speed of light, 
K is a constant of magnitude between 0 and +/-3, such that $K/(c^2) << 1$. 
Ar is the acceleration of the planet towards the Sun due to Newtonian gravitational influence of the Sun, ($Ar = GM/r^2$).
Vr is radial component of planet velocity relative to the Sun (+ = motion away from the Sun)
Vt is transverse  component of planet velocity relative to the Sun (+ = direction of planet forward motion along its orbital path). Vectorially Vt = V - Vr where V is the total instantaneous velocity vector of the planet relative to the Sun. 
Assume planet mass is small relative to the Sun
No other bodies are in the system
All motions and accelerations are confined to the two-dimensional plane of the orbit.

UPDATE
The reason why this is interesting to me is that a value of K = +3 in my computer model produces anomalous (Non-Newtonian) periapse rotation rate values very close within about 1% of those predicted by General Relativity and within a few percent of those observed by astronomers (Le Verrier, updated by Newcomb).
Formula (Einstein, 1915) for GR-derived periapse rotation (radians per orbit)
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession
$$
\boldsymbol{\omega}=24.\pi^3.a^2.T^{-2}.c^{-2}.(1-e^2)^{-1}
$$
UPDATE 4
I have accepted Walter's answer.  Not only did he answer the original question (Is there a technique...?) but also his analysis produces a formula which not only confirms the computer-simulated effects of the transverse acceleration formula (for K = 3) but which also (unexpectedly to me) is essentially equivalent to the Einstein 1915 formula.
from Walter's Summary (in Walter's answer below):-
: (from first order peturbation analysis) semi-major axis and eccentricity are unchanged, but the direction of periapse rotates in the plane of the orbit at rate $$ \omega=\Omega \frac{v_c^2}{c^2} \frac{K}{1-e^2}, $$ where $\Omega$ is the orbital frequency and $v_c=\Omega a$ with $a$ the semi-major axis. Note that (for $K=3$) this agrees with the general relativity (GR) precession rate at order $v_c^2/c^2$ (given by Einstein 1915).
