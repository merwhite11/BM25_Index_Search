Can a neutron star ever be less than about 1.44 solar masses (the Chandrasekhar limit)? Why not?

I learned about the Chandrasekhar limit as being the UPPER limit, in terms of mass, for a white dwarf...
But, I have never heard of a neutron star being BELOW that mass, so I have wondered, recently, if that is also a LOWER limit for neutron stars...
I suppose that the squished-together protons and electrons that the neutron star is made of might lose their 'degeneracy', if the gravitational potential is (or becomes) low enough, and the star might 'poof-out' (or proof back out) to a white dwarf...
Has this ever been known to happen?
Can a neutron star experience Hawking radiation and actually lose mass, like a black hole?
If black holes can, theoretically at least, exist at very small masses as long as they are small enough voluminously (compacted within their Swarzschild or Kerr radii), then why can't neutron stars?
