What factors influence the Widmanstätten pattern in iron meteorites?

The cores of iron meteorites exhibit beautiful Widmanstätten patterns, as shown below in the Alvord meteorite (photo by Jim H):

I understand these patterns form when the molten nickel-iron core of its host body cools. As with normal crystal formation, slower cooling rates lead to longer crystal-formation times, which leads to larger crystals.
Beyond that, what factors influence the formation of the crystal, and in what ways?
I imagine composition and cooling time are the dominant factors....
