how accurate are the predictions for coronal mass ejections-(location, timing and magnitude)?

I suppose this applies to all solar events.
I know centuries ago they knew the quantity of these things fluxuated in  solar cycles. Apart from that I know there has been advancement in solar weather forecasting but how accurate is it? Could, say ESA, have enough foreknowledge to launch a satellite or have one poised in solar orbit to 'go fishing' to investigate the emissions in someway? ?composition of particles- for example?
