How can scientists deduce the number of types of neutrinos, or 'effective number', from Planck satellite data?

Is it related to the way they deduce the Hubble constant from Planck data?
Would more types of oscillating and mixing neutrinos mean faster or slower expansion of the universe?
Would a fourth mass eigenstate necessarily be heavier than the three we already know about?  Would it have caused earlier 'decoupling' from everything else?
