Can Stellar Spaghetti ever escape?

Spaghettification is the deformation of a body into long, thin strips due to tidal forces as the body passes through a powerful gravitational field. Image from wikipedia:

Stellar spaghetti has been indirectly observed as the spaghetti flared on entry into a black hole according to this news article.  In this case, half of a star was spaghettified and consumed by the black hole in a spiral galaxy in the Eridanus constellation.
Question: Can stellar spaghetti ever escape the gravitational field that shaped it?  Or is it always doomed to be consumed or bound to orbit around the more massive object?
