How come we see something xx light years away?

If we are at point A in the universe and something is say 13 billion light years away, wouldn’t we have to travel wayyyy faster than the speed of light from the Big Bang in order to turn around from point A and “look back in time” that far? I don’t know if I’m making any sense here, but how did we get “here”, 13 billion years before even the light from those galaxies got here?
