Why does light pollution make the night sky completely black without stars?

I have seens pics of the night sky in areas that naturally have little population like deserts, cold regions and forests and the night sky is slighly bright and colored by shades of blue, red, purple and yellow with many bright stars in the sky. However in a big city like Rio de Janeiro where I live the night sky is boring it is always black and do not have any stars. Why?
