What is the current size of the SN1006 supernova remnant?

I was enamored by the wikipedia article of SN1006.  Esp. the fact that it was so bright, it could cast shadows on the ground.  (Even this idea that you could have possibly read parchment with just the light from the supernova.  Source).
The Question is basically what is the width (radius?) of the remnant as seen in this picture.
