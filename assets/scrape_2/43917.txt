Could Sgr A* be a core of dark matter instead of a supermassive black hole?

A recent paper (related news) shows that Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way galaxy could be a dark matter core, instead of a supermassive black hole, according to their calculation using the astrometry data of the 17 best-resolved S-stars and the mysterious G2. The dark matter particles could be 56 keV fermions, which they call "darkinos".
The team also proposes that, above a critical mass, a dark matter clump could gravitationally collapse into a supermassive black hole, like the one in M87.
Is this dark matter model possible? Do the flares from Sgr A* observed in recent years support or contradict this model? Can LHC or other smaller particle colliders or detectors on Earth help to confirm or rule out the particle?
