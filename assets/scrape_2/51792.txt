When Only 50% percent of the sky will be filled with stars?

Answers to Approximately what percent of the sky has nothing in it? seem to suggest that with enough depth, we will finally hit something hence the sky is basically 100% full for any given resolution. While I agree with the reasoning there, I feel (maybe wrongly so) that something is missing in the analyses; As I understand, the amount of matter in the universe is finite and so we can't, even theoretically, actually good deeper ad infinitum. There is a limit to our depth.
To continue with this line of thought, we might also remember that the current understanding is that the universe is expanding, so is the distance between the galaxies and the stars and so most of the galaxies will become smaller (with maybe the exception of Andromeda). Why then can't we reach the position where most of the sky is empty? Or can we? If so when? Why, at this very moment, is the universe still baby that 100% of the sky is full - it is highly improbable since "most of the time", so it is sometimes said, the universe will be dark and cold.
Or as the universe gets old, so new matter is revealed to us?
We can rephrase this question from another angle: As we have depth-limit (since the universe in finite we think), there is a specific resolution in which the sky will be only 50% full even with maximal depth. What is this resolution?
