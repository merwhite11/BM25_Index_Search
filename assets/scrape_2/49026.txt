Is an extreme precession on a tidally locked planet possible?

Let's assume an exoplanet orbits a red dwarf star closely enough that is tidally locked to it. Is it possible for the planet to have a significant axial precession? If not naturally, is it possible to strike the planet with a glancing blow of something akin to a rogue planet that this precession is imparted?
