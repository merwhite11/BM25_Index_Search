Calculate moon illumination given moon age

trying to compute moon illumination percent from moon day.
To get moon day in pseudo code I do:
LUNAR_MONTH = 29.530588853
KNOWN_NEW_MOON = JulianDay("2000-01-06 06:14")
age = (julian_day_now - KNOWN_NEW_MOON).abs % LUNAR_MONTH

So that shows me right now an age of 10.9 days. How do I tell percent illumination?

PS I've got the above way to calculate moon age from wikipedia.
