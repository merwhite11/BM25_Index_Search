Tips for a beginer who wants to learn more about astronomy

I have completely no idea about astronomy, but I am starting growing interest in it as I have been always wondering on what has been discovered out there and since I am studying CS, maybe I will learn more than I think as CS and astronomy as relative to some point. How should I start? Can you suggest me a good website for example or something else?
(I know this is an opinion - based question but still I need to make this question here).
