How close to circular is the Earth's equator

Earth's orbit is about 99% circular. How circular is Earth around the equator? I know it bulges around the equator and is a spheroid. I also know it is not smooth and has oceans and mountains and all that. 
Is there a similar measure of eccentricity to describe how circular it is around the equator? 
Is it stretched into an ellipse by the sun/moon, and if so by how much?
Just for comparison, does the Earth's equator deviate from a circle more than the Earths' orbit around the Sun deviates from a circle?
