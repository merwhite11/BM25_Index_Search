What is it that I have been seeing in the sky?

So I'm interested in space scientifically. I do have a firm belief that there could be intelligent civilizations in our universe. Just wanted to get that out of the way.
I've been spending the evenings in the garden due the weather. Past two days I've seen the same similar thing and I'm not sure what it is. I have observed many 'shooting stars', planets, satellites, and aircraft. It's just one solid bright white light. I actually checked it with binoculars I had in the kitchen an yeah all I can see is bright white light. It is much brighter and larger to my eye than satellites appear. It is about 22:00 when I see these it is pretty dark but I wouldn't say peak darkness. It moves steadily faster than large aircraft like commercial flights that I can see. It moves in a straight line I think and is fully visible but just as that bright light.
I could possibly go to lengths and get images of it if anyone wants I took video on both occasions. They are pretty clear and I tried adjusting stuff on the camera to improve the quality while filming.
Anyway, would be interested in what it could be obviously. Responses will be appreciated.

Okay, so the town I'm in is called Colchester, United Kingdom.
I was facing West, it came from above the cloud, was to the right side of Bootes. Carried on in a straight line across the whole sky travelling East until it was no longer visible. The light remained bright the entire time.
Oh, and 22:00, GMT.
I am uploading the videos and images, I will link to it.
