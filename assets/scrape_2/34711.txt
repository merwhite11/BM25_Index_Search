Will the nebula of Betelgeuse be visible to the naked eye? How bright, how large, how soon, for how long?

When Betelgeuse goes core collapse supernova it will leave a supernova remnant. Will it become visible to the naked eye? If so, in what time frame will it be visible. Will it be star like from the beginning, or only after decades or centuries of expansion, to then fade away as it thins out?
The Crab Nebula seems to have had a progenitor of similar mass as Betelgeuse, also a core collapse supernova about 800 years ago, and is about ten times further away. Its supernova remnant seems to be about 300x400 arc seconds in size, so about a fifth of the Moon's diameter on the sky. But it is not visible to the naked eye.
If Betelgeuse's remnant becomes a pulsar, would light from its jets hitting gas be visible to the naked eye, and further out earlier than the supernova remnant itself?
