How do we know that supermassive black holes can gain mass by means other than merging with other supermassive black holes?

I just stumbled across the following answer "update" from 2013:

This just in, recent observations have ruled out the possibility that SMBHs gain mass only through merging with other black holes. For more, see this Astronomy.com article.

Question: How do we know that supermassive black holes can gain mass by means other than merging with other supermassive black holes? I can't figure it out from the linked Astronomy.com article. In fact I can barely read it behind all the blinking advertisements that it now displays (and probably didn't back in 2013)

Why do we believe that the super massive black holes at the centers of two merging galaxies would themselves merge?
What enhances the capture and merge rates of pairs of small black holes orbiting around supermassive black holes?
Why would the merger of spinning black holes within the accretion disk of a supermassive black hole cause them to "shoot straight up" out of the disk?
