Why histogram does not look like the Gaussian curve?

I have data consisting of radial velocities and times (covering about 10 000 days). The radial velocity changes with a period. I tried to find out the period using Stellingwerf's method (it was successful), and then I applied the bootstrap method to determine the uncertainty. I obtained a histogram that is very different from the Gaussian curve. What could be the cause?
