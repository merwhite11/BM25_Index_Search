Is there a database of all known star names/identifiers?

I am looking for a list of all known identifiers used for stars. I'm not sure on the terminology. While I do want the "proper names", I also want whatever identifier is used for each star detected, even those without proper names. I am assuming there are far more of the latter.
If possible I would also like to have the coordinates and brightness (and any other interesting info) for each of these star. But just the list of identifiers would be great.
Does such data exist somewhere? Ideally I can just download a simple file (like a csv) and I can write my own software to process it without fiddling with some other software. However, it may be too large for that. 
I'm not sure what to expect... 1 million entries?
