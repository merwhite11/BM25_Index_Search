Are planets moving away from the sun?

I saw on the tv show Through the Wormhole (hosted by Morgan Freeman) that the planets in our solar system have been continuously moving away from the sun for millions of years. however, when I try to Google about it, there isn't much written about it. 
Is it a proven fact that the planets are moving away from the sun?
