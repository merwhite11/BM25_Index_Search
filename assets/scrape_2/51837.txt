Do M dwarf stars emit the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum necessary for photosynthesis?

I read a lot of press as of late about earth size planets around the habitable zone of M dwarf stars. I am not an astronomer but I assume this means that the distance will allow liquid water to exist.
I was curious if any studies were done of what the electromagnetic spectrum would be and it's strength at the distance that the earth like planets are discovered and if that was adequate for photosynthesis to occur? Google didn't help much on this and I probably shouldn't even ask.
I won't be disappointed if I hear we don't have instruments that will do that yet. This is difficult science for sure.
