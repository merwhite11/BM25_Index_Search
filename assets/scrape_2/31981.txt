How did Arecibo make radar images of ice on Mercury's poles?

update: I still haven't been able to get my hands on the Icarus paper linked below (I'll try other libraries) but these are newer and quite interesting!:

How did Arecibo make radar images of ice on Mercury's poles?

How were observations of the poles of Mercury geometrically possible from Earth?
How was "high-resolution (1.5-km) imaging" possible from Earth?
How was ice identified and imaged?


From Chapter 6; Planetary Radar Astronomy in A Strategy for Active Remote Sensing Amid Increased Demand for Radio Spectrum (2015):

Radar observations from Earth continue to provide new information about the terrestrial planets and the Moon despite the many spacecraft flybys, orbiters, and landers. The unique radar back-scattering properties of water ice led to the discovery by ground-based radar of ice deposits in the permanently shadowed portions of impact craters at Mercury’s poles. High-resolution (1.5 km) radar imaging of these deposits has mapped out their distribution with high precision9 (Figure 6.9).
