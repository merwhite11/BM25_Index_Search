Do neutrinos have as much information as photons do?

If neutrino detectors keep improving so that a fair number of neutrinos can be observed, would they be as informative for astronomy as photons are?
They are of course a very valuable complement to photons, but I'm thinking about neutrinos in and of themselves. Photons have wavelength, spectral lines, redshift, diffraction, polarization which reveal their origin and interactions on the way to us. Do neutrinos say more than just what direction they come from?
