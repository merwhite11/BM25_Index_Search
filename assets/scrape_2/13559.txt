How probably is it that galaxies will extinguish?

In the nebulaes of galaxies are stars born, but the gasses and dust they are made of comes from exploded stars (fe supernovas). So it looks like these processes can go on continuesly. But is that really the case, or does according to entropy(?) galaxies extinguish because fe the galaxie went too big so gravity has no opportunity to form other stars any more. And before colliding with other galaxies it is passed away. So is there any sign that galaxies are getting smaller or less active?
