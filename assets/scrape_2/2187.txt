Assumption of our universe being the surface of a 4-D sphere in order to describe relative uniformity in the cosmic microwave background?

It seems as if this is necessary to assume in order for the CMB to make an sense. Otherwise, an instantaneous infinite Euclidean space model would work. The issue is, with any visualization of the Big Bang, let's take a Big Bang visualization in 3 - dimensions, the radiation emitted from the creation of hydrogen atoms would not necessarily be all around us, as it is. Our position in space would dictate what we would observe in terms of background radiation.
