Ludwig's star distance

Mizar and Alcor, each about 83 light-years away (in fact Mizar presents system of four stars and Alcor is binary system. It is not yet known if those 6 stars presents one or two star systems. In further years, data provided by GAIA space telescope will show us if there is one or two systems), have a fainter line-of-sight companion known as
Ludwig's star, which was mistaken for a planet in 1722.
The Wikipedia page only says it is "roughly five times more distant," citing A New View of Mizar by Leos Ondra.
Is a better distance estimate available?
