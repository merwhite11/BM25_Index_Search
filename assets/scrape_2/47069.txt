Am I looking at the moon upside down here in the US?

This may be a very basic question, but I just learned that the moon orbits around the earth counterclockwise. I always thought the earth and the moon shared the rotation and orbit direction. Since the moon always shows the same face to the earth, does that mean the moon's north pole is at the bottom when I look at it from the US?
If that's the case, then in my trip to Chile when looked at the moon there... was I looking at the moon upright?
I'm not an astronomer, so it would be great to get an answer in simple terms. Thank you!
