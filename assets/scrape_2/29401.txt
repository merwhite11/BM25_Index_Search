does the orientation of orbital plane of our solar system rotate with the galaxy

As I understand it, our solar system travels through the milky way with the orbital plane tilted about 60 degrees so that we are sort of traveling in the direction of earth's north. My question is if our orbital plane rotates with our galactic orbit so that it maintains its orientation in relation to the center of the galaxy as I've show in this first picture.

Or is the orientation unaffected by the galactic orbit as I've shown in this second picture.
