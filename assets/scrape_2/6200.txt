Which spiral arm of the Milky Way is Kepler-62 in?

I am trying to find out which spiral arm of the Milky Way the star Kepler-62 and its planetary system are in. All I can find by Google searching is that it is part of the Lyra constellation, but I don't know if that entire constellation is within 1 spiral arm or not, nor which arm it is in.
Is Kepler-62 in the Carinaâ€“Sagittarius Arm, or in the Orion Arm, or...?
The only map picture I can find that is somewhat related is this (I assume that the yellow light area is the area in which Kepler-62 was sighted by the Kepler spacecraft): http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/LombergA1024.jpg
Thank you!
