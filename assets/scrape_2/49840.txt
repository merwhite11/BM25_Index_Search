What's the brightest magnitude that the ISS can appear from Earth's surface?

Heavens-above indicates that this evening, it will fly almost over my head (79Â°) with a sizzling magnitude of -3.9. What is the maximum brightness it can have?
Is there a formula to calculate its lowest magnitude, theoretically?
