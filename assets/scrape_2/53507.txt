Combining Systems Engineering and Cosmology/Astrophysics

in a nutshell, my undergrad was in Astrophysics, my master's is in Systems Engineering (SE), and I am currently completing my Ph.D. in SE focusing on deep learning applications towards engineering design systems.
My question is:
Is there a way to combine SE and astrophysics?
Before anyone asks, why didn't I continue in astro? because I am in the military, and there is no distance-learning astrophysics programs at the PhD level.
