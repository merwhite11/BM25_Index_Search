Any results from the probe that has been crashed into an asteroid once?

About two or three years ago I think a probe whose name I forgot has been crashed into an asteroid at high speed to see what would happen if we tried to collide something with an asteroid on Earth course. The asteroid the probe was crashed into had a moon as well. What were the results of the crash? Did the asteroid slow down? Did it change direction? What happened to its satellite?
