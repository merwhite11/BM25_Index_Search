How do I calculate the Hill radius of a star in a binary system?

Is there an easy way to calculate the Hill radius of a star in a binary system at different orbital radii where both stars are of the same mass and in circular orbit around one another’s centre of mass?
I have seen a formula for calculating Hill radii but it’s meant to address the stability of orbits around a small body which itself orbits a large one, an example of which would be the effect of the Sun's gravity on the orbit of an object around the Earth. 
Can the same formula be used if both major bodies are of similar or the same size, for example to address the stability of planetary orbits around one star in a binary system?
