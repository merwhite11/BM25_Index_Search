Could the big bang have created super massive black holes?

I understand that space was compressed to a single point and that during the big bang all points within that expanded away from each other at phenomenal speeds. I also have heard that during this the universe wasn't the same everywhere, as in small quantum fluctuations that expanded to macroscopic scales. 
Would this mean that higher density than normal areas could create massive black holes? Maybe not as big as the ones today but perhaps large enough to solve some of the problems with super massive black holes being observed in a short amount of time after the big bang
I am not asking "why didn't the universe turn into a singularity?" I am asking "Could the variable density afterwards create many singularities which could explain for the problems associated with super massive blackholes?".
