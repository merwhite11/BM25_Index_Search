What would happen if Venus and Earth collided?

The first thing we would need to consider is that Earth has already been hit by a protoplanet half its size 4.5 billion years ago, meaning the Earth may have a chance of staying intact after the collision.
The next thing we would need to think about is the Moon. The impact would have a gigantic force and may disrupt the Moon's orbit, which would lead to two possibilities: either it would collide with the Earth-Venus body, or it would get ejected into space, without any planet to orbit. It may even start orbiting the Sun. The Earth could get completely destroyed, but again, it went through that before.
I also am wondering if it might disrupt any of the planets in any way, and if Earth's orbit might be changed. Thanks for answering the question!
