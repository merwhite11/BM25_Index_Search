Is there a good replacement finder scope for the Celestron 127EQ?

I've had a Celestron 127EQ for a couple years now and have only used it a couple times.
One of the reasons I haven't gotten much use out of it is that when I do use it I spend all of my time aligning the finder scope. Every time I so much as breath on it the alignment is gone.
It already takes me a good while to line the scope up once and then as soon as I try to target something with it I inevitably brush some part of my face against the finder scope and have to start over with the alignment.
I'm happy to buy a new mount and/or finder scope, I just have no idea what to get that won't be just as bad.
