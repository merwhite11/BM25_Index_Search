Depth of primary and secondary minimum in a light curve

How can I explain approximately the same depth of primary and secondary minimum in light curve? 
I observe star HD 36486. I tried filters MOST and BRITE.
Is it related with photometric filter? When I change the filter in program for analysis the result is the same.
