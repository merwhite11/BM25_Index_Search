What are optical artifacts in source images?

In Stellarium, there are two green squares in the constellation Sextans (close to the star Alpha Sextantis). The app doesn't provide any information as to what these are.

I was curious and so I decided to contact the Stellarium team, who thankfully replied:

These are optical artifacts in the source images we used for the background sky. We hope to clean these up at some point.

Can someone please explain to me what optical artifacts in the source images means?
Does Stellarium use real images (source images) of the sky and build on top of them the graphical interface?
