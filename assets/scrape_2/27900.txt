Can a planet's changing tilt be aligned with the rotation around its star?

What I'm asking is if the tilt of a planet can "follow" the rotation around its star so that, for example, its north pole would always lean towards the star, and thus always be under daylight. The planet could have a tilt similar to earth's 23.5Â°. And can that planet have a rotation around its axis, allowing for day/night cycles closer to the equator? Hopefully this image will explain what I mean. The tilt (red line) stays the same, but the pole is leaning toward the star throughout the whole year, while the planet rotates around its axis.
