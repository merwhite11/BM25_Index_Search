Moon's path as seen from Earth

As observed from the surface of Earth:
Will the moon ever repeat the same path (trajectory)?
If yes, what is the period of repetition?
And also will the moon cover the night sky with its path completely over a period of time?
More explanation:
I was observing the moon from my window and I was wondering will the moon follow the same path (trajectory) as it did before, and if I am taking photos all the different positions of the moon over a long period of time will it have covered the night sky?
