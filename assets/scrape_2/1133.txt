Is the Jupiter-Sun system considered a binary system of some type?

Since Jupiter is very massive, it is the only planet (in our solar system) that has a center of mass with the Sun that lies outside the volume of the Sun. (Source)
If Jupiter was a star, they would form a « binary star ».
If the Sun was a planet, they would form a « double planet ».
Since the Sun is a star and Jupiter is a planet, does this have a particular name?
Does Jupiter have a special status or a particular effect in our solar system because of its heavy mass?
Since Jupiter-Sun's center of mass lies outside the volume of the Sun, that means that the Sun moves around that center of mass. Does this have an effect on Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars orbits?
