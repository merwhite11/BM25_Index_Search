Why was it so difficult to figure out the form of the Milky Way?

The exact form of the Milky Way was figured out the in early fifties of the 20-th century. Why did it take so long to see?
Is it because we are in the "middle" of it? In general, it's easier to find out the shape of something if you place yourself at a distance from it. Galactic forms were discovered long before the shape of our own was discovered (it can't be observed directly, obviously). Have these shapes helped to find its shape (how big it is seems no problem to see, or is it?)? The fact of being inside seems an obstacle (while it facilitates other stuff). How was this obstacle removed?
