What is the estimated density of the dark matter?

What is the estimated density of the dark matter? Some clumps of dark matter might have higher density and others might have lower density. So what is the estimated density range of dark matter?
Is it possible for clumps dense enough like for example iron to exist? If you get close to it, can you grab a piece and put it in a bucket?
Can you make invisible objects from it? Say for example a ball or a hammer made of dark matter.
