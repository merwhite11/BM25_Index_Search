In binary systems, does the speed of the objects vary as they adjust to the movement of the other object?

The speed of objects orbiting in a binary system, like Pluto and Charon, is the speed and direction of the objects smooth, or, do the objects make adjustments that are in some ways like a "tug of war" and measurable, showing up as changes in speed or periodic adjustments of direction?
Reasoning: object has momentum, as other objects moves, that momentum remains, while gravitational pull direction changes. Two possible models, either smooth orbit, or, periodic adjustments a bit like a "tug of war".
A poor illustration of the concept of momentum + adjustments showing a periodicity.

Even a smooth and continuous manner down to smallest possible scale must have some wave-like pattern to it. And, based on clockwork harmony, that pattern should repeat itself.
