What if the atmosphere of Titan were like the one on Venus?

The current mean temperature in Titan is −180 ºC (93 K), the same as in Saturn.
But I was wondering what would be the case if the atmosphere of Titan would be like the Venus atmosphere, whose composition is mainly CO2 and has a pressure of 90 bar, instead of approximately 1.5 bar.
What temperature could Titan reach in that case? Would the greenhouse effect allow the moon to be heated enough to maintain liquid water or is it too far from the Sun to be affected by any kind of greenhouse effect? Maybe the latest question allows to ask another one: How far from the Sun could Venus be so it can have temperatures above 0 ºC?
The question may be answered given two possible alternatives:

Same composition as Venus, but same pressure as in Titan.
Same composition and pressure as in Venus.
