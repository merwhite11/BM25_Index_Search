Are these Jupiter's moons?


Sorry for the huge picture), anyway, as you can see, there are 2 specks of light on either side of the upper planet which is likely Jupiter as the lower one is clearly Saturn-shaped.
I was going through some old photos when I came across the picture I took of the great conjunction that happened last year(I can't post the picture here as it's too large, so I cropped out just Jupiter)
So I was wondering, could these be two of the Galilean moons(If so, I think these 2 should be Io and Ganymede) or is it just light being reflected?
I am asking this because I thought all of the Galilean moons were of equal brightness, so it seemed unlikely to me that only 2 would be visible.
Someone asked for specific information, and here they are:
