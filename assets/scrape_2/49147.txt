How are CMB frame redshifts of galaxies corrected for coherent flows?

Say, if I downloaded the CMB frame redshifts of some galaxies from NED database, then what is the procedure to correct it for coherent flows?
I'm using the SNooPy(snpy) Python package to analyze some Type Ia supernova data collected from CSP archive. snpy provides a method called sn.get_zcmb() to collect the redshift of the SNe Ia host galaxy corrected to CMB frame from NED calculator. Now, for cosmological studies mere z_cmb isn't enough, we need to correct it for bulk coherent flow as per literature. But the procedure to correct for it isn't known to me.
