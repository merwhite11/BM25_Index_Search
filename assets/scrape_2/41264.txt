Why would the side of the moon that faces earth be as dark as the far side of the moon?

Somebody suggested that the side of the moon that always faces the earth is as dark as the far side of the moon, but is that really the case? Doesnâ€™t earth-shine make the earth-facing side of the moon overall brighter? Or does the absence of a moon atmosphere negate any possible gain from earth-shine?
