Why did it take so long for SN1987A to reach peak brightness?


The light from SN1987A first reached us on  February 23, 1987, and its brightness peaked in mid May, almost 3 months later.
However, every source that I can find states that it normally only takes a few weeks for Supernovae to reach their peak brightness.
Here, it states that "Supernovae of both types reach maximum optical brightness 2 to 3 weeks after their explosions." And here  it states that "A typical supernova reaches its maximum brightness about 20 days after explosion."
Finally here is a graph from Wikipedia of what typical Supernova light curves look like.
What's the reason for this discrepancy?
