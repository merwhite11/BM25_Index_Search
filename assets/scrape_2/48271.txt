Why orient a refracting telescope to the North?

I'm a french Guide of french military heritage. I have to prepare visit about "L'observatoire de la Marine, moulins du faouÃ«dic" (Former windmill which served as an astronomical and meteorological observatory for the French Navy) in Lorient (famous french port).
The refracting telescope was oriented exclusively to the North. So, I've a question :
Is there a reason for the telescope to point north? Why this choice ? How it works ?
Thanks for yours answers ! I'm sorry for my level of English...
Have a nice day !
