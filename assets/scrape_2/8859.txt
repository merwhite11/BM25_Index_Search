What would the night sky look like if Earth orbited an intergalactic star?

If the Earth and its host star were located exactly in-between the Milky Way and Andromeda would the night sky be completely void of light? 
Would stars be visible to the unaided eye?
So there could be a civilization that exists in which the night is completely void of light? â€¦that would suck
