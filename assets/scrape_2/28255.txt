Mars looks like a blur

I took my telescope out tonight (I am new, just got the telescope a few days ago, it's my first one) and I was observing Mars, however all I see is just an bright orange circle, with no surface detail, regardless of magnification. The telescope I'm using is a 8in Newtonian, 1200mm focal length. Here's what I saw with a 8mm eyepiece and 2x Barlow:

Mars was about 32Â° above the horizon when I took this image. 
Did I just do a poor job with collimation? Is the the observation angle? Please let me know!
