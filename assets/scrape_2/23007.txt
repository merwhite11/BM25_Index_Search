Why the moon is blinding me right now?

I'm on the most northern part of Germany (Schleswig-Holstein) it is 11.20pm right now and the moon is here as bright as I never saw it before I was just outside and it is as bright as if it was dim daylight. When the clouds moved away from the moon and I looked into the moon for a little moment it was so bright, that it actually glared me for a little moment. Is there anything specific going on that is just favored this event? Or is it something that simply happens sometimes and I just never noticed it before?
