Spotted a moving star-like object

So a couple days ago, my husband and I spotted a moving object in the sky just like a star. I know it wasn't a plane or a drone, and it was way up in the sky just a star. It just moved smoothly across the skies and than disappeared. I love to observe the sky so that was priceless for me and my husband.
