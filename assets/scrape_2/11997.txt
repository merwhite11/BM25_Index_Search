How many constellations in the Zodiac?

The astronomical zodiac contains a bunch of constellations along the ecliptic.
Some sources say there are 13 constellations in the astronomical zodiac. Other sources claim there are 12.
According to NASA (Constellations in the zodiac):

If we count all the traditional constellations, there are 13 in the
zodiac, not 12. So here are the dates (give or take one day each year)
when the Sun is between Earth and each of these 13 constellations.)

There seems to be some confusion out there between zodiac constellations (in astronomy) and zodiac signs (in astrology). From the research I've done so far (including the quote above), it seems as though one of them (Ophiuchus) is a "recent addition", possibly due to the Earth's precession since ancient times (Why did your zodiac sign change? We asked the astronomer who started it all).
What (officially?) are the constellations of the astronomical zodiac?
Why do some sources list 12 and others list 13?
