Sun's apparent motion above the arctic circle during summer solstice

I'm having difficulty with an apparent contradiction about the sun's motion during the summer solstice above the arctic circle.
The YouTube video The North Pole Entire Summer of never ending sun Summer Solstice High speed camera and solar motion models show the sun to move clockwise around the horizon for the full 360 degrees during the summer solstice.
However, when I walk in a circle counterclockwise, to represent the earth's rotation, and focus upon a fixed object outside the circle to represent the sun, I get a 180 degree motion, from "east to west", and then the sun's apparent motion returns again from west to east, not the full 360 degrees which everyone reports is the actual phenomenon.  
Can someone help me to understand my dilemma?
