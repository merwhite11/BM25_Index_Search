which fraction of the solar radiation corresponds the blocked part by Venus at its transit upon he sun?

Well, asumming that Venus orbits the Sun at 0.7233 AU and its diameter is 12,104 km, I can conclude that its angular diameter seen from the earth is ~1', then its represents ~1/31 part of the angular diameter of solar disc, so that's represents only $1365Wm^{-2}/31 ~ 44 Wm^{-2}$ , hence that fraction represents just ~ 44/1365 ~ 0.0322... of the total radiation.
Did I reason correctly?
