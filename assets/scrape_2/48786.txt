Is the solar system the only survivor of cosmic evolution?

A question has entered my mind, we know that all the phenomena in the universe are several thousand light years away from us, so the light we see from them is related to the past few years, now my question is whether this possibility exists Is it that we are alone in the universe and all of them have been destroyed and only the solar system and we are left from the evolution of the universe?
