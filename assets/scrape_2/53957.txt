Can a quasi-star develop a stable crust?

Could a quasi-star potentially develop a stable outer layer or crust during its early stage of formation if it were to be bombarded with substantial amounts of matter, coexisting with its core and the central black hole?
Despite the inherent instability of quasi-stars, is it theoretically possible for such a multi-layered structure to exist?
