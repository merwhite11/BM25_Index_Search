Orientation of the optical telescope assembly in the Hubble Space Telescope

What is the orientation of the optical telescope assembly with respect to the direction of motion of the Hubble Space Telescope? If it happens to be in the direction of motion, does the primary mirror face the direction of motion or is it facing backwards, similar to a rear view mirror?
