How to become proficient using the JWST pipeline?

I am trying to obtain proficiency in reviewing and analyzing JWST data. To that end, I have installed python jdaviz environment and files and JWST python environment and files. I am tinkering with some of the apps and example data. I realize is it several months before any real data can be obtained but I'd like to develop some proficiency during the shakedown period.
I wish to find a description of the final operational data acquisition pipeline steps for JWST. There are descriptions of a calibration reference (CRDS) data pipeline but I don't know if that is only for initial calibration or is that for the final data flow.
Could someone point me to the final data pipeline scheme and needed software as well as to how to arrive at it from the initial efforts at startup and calibration.
I need some technical detail - not layman level-  but I am also not an analytical astronomer either, just a broken-down engineer.
