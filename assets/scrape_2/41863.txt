Can you attach an old Vixen model to a celestron tripod?

I would like to know if I can put an old Vixen VMC model (15 years old) onto a celestron 4se tripod. I am aware that some adaptations must be made, but I want to know if it's even possible or if it will miss alignments by far, or not work at all.
