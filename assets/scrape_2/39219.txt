Good eyepieces for Saturn and Jupiter

I have a celestron powerseeker 114eq telescope. Aperture : 114mm Focal Length: 900mm
I have 20mm and 4mm eyepieces and a 3x Barlow. I have seen Saturn's rings using 4mm eyepiece but it's blurry and with 3x it becomes impossible to see any detail. With 20mm with 3x barlow they are too small. I found a kit on amazon with 6mm and 12.5mm kellener eyepieces with a moon filter. I wanted to view a little larger than 20mm with 3x barlow and with details like color contrasts. Could anyone tell whether the kit that I found will be useful or anything else to suggest to solve my problem?
