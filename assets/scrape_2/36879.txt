Solar flares/CME dangers to life?

I know a repeat of the 1859 Carrington Event (coronal mass ejection) would pose a severe risk to power grids and telecommunication networks but wouldn't pose an immediate threat to life.
If a large solar flare can release 10e32 ergs of energy, is there an energy level where a solar flare or CME would pose an immediate threat to any life on the Earth that doesn't live below sea level.
