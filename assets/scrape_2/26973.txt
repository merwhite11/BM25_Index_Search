Is there a name for the star/supernova hypothesized to have been a precursor to the Solar System?

I found an article suggesting a supernova injected debris which helped nudge the formation of the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago.
I couldn't find a name for this hypothetical star/supernova after some research. Is there one? What is it?
