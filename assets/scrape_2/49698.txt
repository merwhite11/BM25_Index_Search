Recognize the celestial object in UMa

I’m new to Astronomy observations. I took a picture from my phone of a object near beta Ursa Major and m97 which I couldn’t find (I was on low magnification), I couldn’t find out what it was. Any ideas of what it was (or is it due to my telescope being set up incorrectly)?
