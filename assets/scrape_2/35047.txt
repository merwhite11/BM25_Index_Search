Who discovered Wolf 359?

I always assumed that Wolf 359's discoverer had been Max Wolf, but I just found out that he simply measured its high proper movement and included it in his star catalog.
Since Wolf 359 is a very faint star that can only be observed with a large telescope it is clear that it was unknown in ancient times and that some astronomer must have been the first to observe its existence.
Are there any data on who was the first observer of Wolf 359? If not, in which star catalogue or other map was it first included?
