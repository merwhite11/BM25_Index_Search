Is it practical to hand grind a convex parabolic or hyperbolic mirror?

I know it's practical to hand grind a convex spherical mirror and that it's practical to make a concave parabolic mirror from a spherical one. But as I understand it, the procedure for doing so depend on tracking progress by using interference patters generated by focusing light off the mirror, and that procedure clearly can't be used (unmodified) with a convex mirror.
Short of floating the blank in a bath of index of refraction matched optical fluid and apply the concave procedure to the back side, does anyone know of a way to do that sort of grinding?
Also, I've never actually run across a procedure for finishing a hyperbolic mirror for either convex or concave, though I haven't spent much time searching on that one.
