What is the skypath of JWST?

JWST will be in a 6 month halo orbit around the Sun/Earth L2 point, which is located at the anti-solar point. Internet graphics give conflicting information on whether the skypath is clockwise or counterclockwise around this moving point.
This post Will the James Webb Space Telescope be visible from earth? says JWST, in halo orbit, will be observable from earth by dedicated amateurs and provides a link for generating an ephemeris.
Will the skypath be clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to the antisolar point? Will JWST display apparent retrograde motion, or just “slow down”?
