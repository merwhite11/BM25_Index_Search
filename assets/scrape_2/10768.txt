Types of Exoplanets

We discover vastly more exoplanets that are gas giants that orbit their parent star very closely, than small terrestrial planets that are more distant to their sun. Could this be due to the methods we use to find exoplanets?
Gas giants have stronger gravity which makes their star oscillate more. Moreover they are larger which eclipses more of the light of the star during transits?  Are big hot Jupiters far easier to detect than small rocky worlds?
