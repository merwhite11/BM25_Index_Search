Is everything quantum entangled?

So, I am learning about quantum entanglement in my quantum course and had a thought. If the Big Bang is the creation of everything - time included, and this came from a single "source". Would it not follow that all particles in the universe are entangled to each other? And perhaps, we cannot observe this entanglement because we are "inside the system" sort to speak. Are we not all connected? 
I know the last part is cheesy, but the point is serious.
