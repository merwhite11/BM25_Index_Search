Galactic mass estimation from apparent magnitude and distance

Can we estimate the order of the total mass of any galaxy from the apparent magnitude and its distance to us? Just like 
\begin{equation}
M_{galaxy}=c\times 10^{8}M_{\odot },
\end{equation}
where $c$ is a constant (can be arbitrary or ignored, the order is important).
For example mass of the Tucana Dwarf of the Local group isn't known. But its apparent magnitude is 15.7 and average distance is $8.8\times10^{5}pc$. How can I estimate its approximate total mass?
