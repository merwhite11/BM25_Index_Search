Is the largest black hole larger than the Solar System?

Yes. Ton-618 is the largest black hole, and if it was replaced with our solar system, it would reach far after the end of the solar system, which is called the Kuiper Belt. Ton-618 has a mass 66 billion times that of the sun. That is far larger than the largest star known, the Quasi star with a diameter of 1 light year. That is larger than Stephenson 2-18 and much larger than our Sun! One light year is 6 trillion miles.
