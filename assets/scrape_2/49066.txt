What is this strange animation of a pulsar likely trying to illustrate? One beam is normal, the opposite gets wrapped like coiled rope?

The November 2020 Sixty Symbols video How Smooth is a Neutron Star? (linked below) describes negative LIGO results looking for weak but very periodic signals from rotating neutron stars that might radiate gravitational waves due to higher order mass moments.
It shows a lot of animations of neutron stars and pulsars, and some of them feel a bit off to me, often it looks like the beam axis doesn't define a pair of cones as it rotates, as if someone was moving it around by hand instead of using a proper trajectory.
But this image below really confuses me! It shows two "beams" emitted from the poles of a sphere that is presumably a neutron star. One shoots almost straight up, the other extends down but it then coils itself on to a fixed circular loop, like coiled rope.
