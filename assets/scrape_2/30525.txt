Do we know the fluctuations and constant temperature depth of the moon?

Disclaimer: I have no formal scientific training.
From what I understand, surface temperature effects on Earth extend only so far into the ground so that at a certain depth the temperature remains constant around the globe.
Has any attempt been made to identify/predict subsurface temperature fluctuations and/or constant temperature depth?
Note: The reason I am interested in looking under that particular rock, so to speak is that given the dark side/light side temperature difference on the moon I am wondering if we can predict the ideal location and depth on the moon to find a shallow surface layer that leads to a constant temperature in a range suitable for human/plant life without requiring machinery to preserve the temperature.
