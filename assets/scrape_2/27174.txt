Which planet or star is this?


The picture was taken with a smartphone camera at Latitude 48.860045 | Longitude: 2.366202 the 31th of July at 01h07min15s Paris time. On the left is obviously the Moon, and the lower red circle points the point of Latitude: 48.852886 | Longitude: 2.369167. (It's the angel of liberty, place de la Bastille, Paris.)
What does the upper circle point to ?
At the beginning I thought it was Venus, but as far as I remember, it disappears quite early in the evening. I don't think it is Mars : the light reflection on it isn't red enough.
