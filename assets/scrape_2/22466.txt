What wavelengths are used to search for distant solar system objects like KBOs and Oort cloud members?

What wavelengths of light are used/most suited to search for distant solar system objects like KBOs and Oort cloud members? I suppose they are brightest in reflected sunlight, so they are best searched for in visible and near infrared. Is that correct?
