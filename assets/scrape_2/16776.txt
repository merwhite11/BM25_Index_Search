Can information leave the observable Universe?

From what I gather, the observable universe is expanding at the speed of light. In addition, information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. It seems as though these two facts would imply that information cannot leave the observable universe. However, if that is true, it would either mean that the universe started spread apart, or that the observable universe is the entire universe. So, which of these explanations is correct?
