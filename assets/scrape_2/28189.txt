At what latitude could Orion's belt and Aldebaran be ~10 degrees above the horizon at the same time?

In his appearance on television contained in the video The Mystery That Keeps Neil deGrasse Tyson Up At Night, in the backdrop behind astronomer and educator Neil deGrasse Tyson and the talk-show host, what latitude on Earth would have Orion's belt and Aldebaran at equal elevation (about 10 degrees) above the horizon? Could that be Sunrise/Sunset, or are those just city lights?
He's known to be a stickler about such things (the story about the stars in the movie Titanic for example). This background must be calculated from a particular latitude at least (if not longitude and/or season).
