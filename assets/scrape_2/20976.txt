Determining sunrise and sunset times based on azimuth and elevation

If I observe the sun and measure the local azimuth and elevation, and I also have my latitude, can I calculate the local sunrise and local sunset times? If so, how would I calculate it?
Further, can the same calculations be used for the moonrise and moonset?
