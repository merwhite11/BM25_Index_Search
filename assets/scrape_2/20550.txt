Problem about orbiting of a satelite

Problem: There is an satellite that orbits the Earth. Its orbit is circular and its orbital plane is perpendicular to Earth's Equatorial Plane. It orbits is such that a person who is on equator see this satellite on Zenith every 12Hours.
a. Find Satellite's Period.
b. What is distance of satellite to person when it Sets on person's horizon?
My problem with this question is:
For the first part: somewhere said period is 12hours. Somewhere else said the person on equator also moves (Earth Rotation) so 12 hours is P/2 and P= 24hours. What is the right answer?
For the second part: Which of the following figures show the position of satellite when it sets? (Figure 1 or 2?)
