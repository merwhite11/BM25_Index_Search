Is there any planet or black hole where we could experience time dilation like in the movie Interstellar?

As we seen in Interstellar movie Copper goes to a planet where he experienced time dilation which was 1 hour of staying on that planet will cost the 7 years on the earth. So, is there any planet or black hole where time will nearly behave like this? Because the planets in our solar system will show very little differences.
