Collision of asteroid and gaseous planet - what would happen

What happens when asteroids (or other small bodies) "collide" with a gas planet? In my head it would either go through it or just stay "inside" it due to the strong gravity. I tend to believe in the latter one, but if this is the case, does this mean that the gas giants are full of small bodies inside them?
Thank you.
