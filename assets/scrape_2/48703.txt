what percent of moon must be illuminated to be visible with naked eye and clear sky?

Originally, the new Jewish month was determined by the sighting of the new crescent moon.
There are online calendars that give percentage of moon that is illuminated.
Using the computations from these calendars, what is the minimum illumination percentage for someone to be able to unambiguously see it with naked eye assuming perfect sky conditions?
