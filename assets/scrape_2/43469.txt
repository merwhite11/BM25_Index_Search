How do we know or predict which particles were present before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis occurred?

I'm reading Carroll and Ostlie's "An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics". In the BBN section, they describe that the universe contains a mixture of photons, electron-positron pairs, and electron and muon neutrinos and their antiparticles. They also mention that there was a small number of protons and neutrons and that protons and neutrons were constantly being transformed into each other from various reactions. From my understanding (not C & O necessarily), the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle permits matter to spontaneously appear because there is some uncertainty as to how much mass there is in a vacuum; however, these particles must appear in "pairs" (ie. positron and an electron). If we assume inflation is correct, it is thought that these particles would become diluted after this process. So I guess I'm wondering how are these particles predicted in general (during the radiation era)? Is the energy released during inflation thought to have created these particles or something else?
