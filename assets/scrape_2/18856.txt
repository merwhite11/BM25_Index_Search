What (actually) does "peculiar periodic spectral modulations" refer to in this preprint?

I saw this ArXiv preprint after reading about it in the popular media.
I can not even understand the beginning of the introduction (much less the whole paper):

INTRODUCTION
A Fourier transform analysis of 2.5 million spectra in the Data Release 8 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the SEGUE 2 SDSS was carried out to detect periodic modulations contained in their frequency spectra (Trottier 2012).

where Trottier 2012 is Recherche de signaux périodiques dans des spectres astronomiques, M.Sc. Thesis, Université Laval
The modulation frequency seems to be of order 10${}^{-12}$ seconds, and the SDSS is (as far as I know) not really a particularly time-resolved data set. 1 micron wavelength light (for general reference) has a frequency of about 3x10${}^{-14}$.
I'm not asking (necessarily) if this result is right or wrong, I'd just like to understand how the SDSS can actually be analyzed to detect or even infer THz rate modulation!
