Do sungrazing comets leave a field of meteoroids near the Sun?

A large fraction (a third?) of all comets found (with observational bias thanks to SOHO) have been sungrazers, breaking up with perihelion of a few of Sun's radius. Is there reason to believe that this replenishes some kind of vulcanoid population of small objects? Or would they evaporate and be blown away by the Solar wind, or continue in their comet's orbit, or be ejected by Mercury's eccentricity? Would the constant replenishment, even now, not billions of years ago, help keep a population there in spite of all above?
