Origin of heavier elements on earth?

Earth is part of Solar system, which is said to have originated from condensation and mutual attraction in dense clouds of gasses and dust. If Sun is basically more than ninty percent hydrogen and rest is helium. Nuclear fusion inside sun is said to pause near iron(56/26) and also several other planets like Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants. Where did heavy metals and other heavy elements on earth come from if second most nearest star(/star-system) is some four light years away (and mass would take long to come from those sources) ?
