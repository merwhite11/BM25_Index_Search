Was NASA's moon mission completely fake?

I really want to know whether NASA's Moon mission really was a hoax, or if it is a fact. Since there are many points and scenarios which proves it as being filmed in a film studio with controlled conditions and not exactly on from moon's surface.

I also personally believe that we can not send human beyond "Van Allen Radiation Belt".
Also mission was announced in 1961 and in just 8-9 years we were able to send humans to the Moon.(really, I think is not possible with today's technology as well. It will at least take 10-15 years to actually do it today).
The ISS is orbiting at a few hundred km, and still it has lot of risk factors involved. Crew members are really had near death experiences
while carrying out maintenance.
And we are able to go to 370,300 km away from earth and safely return back (what ! ! ! really not possible considering today's technology as well-at least for humans).
So are these Moon missions a hoax, or a forced lie ? 
I don't want to consider any political aspect here (like between the US and Russia etc.) I just want to know whether humans were on the Moon or not ?
