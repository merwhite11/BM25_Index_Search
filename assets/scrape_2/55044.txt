How do Spiral Galaxies become flat?

Our galaxy has been described as roughly the shape of a pizza and the Andromeda galaxy, though I've never heard it described that way, appears similarly disk shaped.  Spiral galaxies make up (roughly) about 60% of the observed galaxies in the Universe, so there must be a standard process that makes this happen.
I don't believe that collisions, and flattening around the axis of rotation would work, which is how the solar-system flattened mostly into an orbital plane.      Space is too empty for that, unless the galaxy begins as a lot of dust and gas, then  . . . maybe?
Is it gravitational interactions?   Is it the massive black hole/quasar in the center that drives the flattening?
I'm curious if this question has been answered by observation of young galaxies, because it seems unlikely to me that it would be collisions like it was with the solar system or with accretion disks.   Am I wrong in that assumption?
