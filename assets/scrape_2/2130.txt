Might the universe be really small yet seem infinite from spherical reflections?

if a single source of light quite small, was placed somewhere inside a completely reflective sphere, quite large, what would the reflections look like from the light source's point of view within that sphere?
:)
extra-credit: what would it look like over the course of time with movement starting from the moment the light turned on?
Found this question has been asked over in MathOverflow, sum clue?
