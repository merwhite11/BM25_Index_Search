Is there a prediction when our solar system would fall apart?

Within a few billion years our Sun would become a red giant and destroying Mercury and Venus and perhaps even the Earth. But nevertheless our solar system still have some planets like Jupiter and Neptune orbitting around the sun, because his mass wouldn't be very different.
After another while our Sun would turn into a white dwarf. Probably his mass changed a bit, but would it be enough to lose for example Neptune?
If not, is there a prediction at what time, if ever, our 'sun' will lose (some of) his planets for the first time?
