Is it possible that the shadow of The Moon is a single dot during solar eclipse?

During a solar eclipse The Moon covers The Sun on some places on the Earth. Now the focal point is a bit above the Earth so the shadow area is about 160 miles.  In history The Moon was a bit closer to the Earth but could there have been a time that the shadow area was just a dot. (probably for just some places as the Earth is not really perfect a sphere and the orbit of the Moon isn't also a perfect circle).
