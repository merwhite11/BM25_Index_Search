Can dark energy or dark matter affect black holes

I was wondering if black holes are the greatest force of gravity how does other highly spoken about concepts such as dark energy or dark matter compare. Can a black hole absorb dark energy or dark matter? I though dark matter held galaxies together. If a black hole could absorb the dark matter would that be a problem: i.e. the universe getting smaller?
