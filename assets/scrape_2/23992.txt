How is the Milky Way on a collision course with Andromeda when the universe is expanding?

At some time in the future it is said our galaxy will collide with Andromeda. Yet at the same time the universe is expanding at a ever-accelerating pace. Using the old raisin-in-the-baking-loaf-of-bread analogy, the raisins grow farther apart and don’t “collide” with each other during the baking process. It seems to be the same way with galaxies and the expanding universe. 
How are these two seemingly conflicting postulates reconciled? What am I missing here?
