Sun (star) spots (size)

My question is about sunspots size.
Does these spots have a 'typical' size for all kinds of stars (dwarves or  super giants), or are they dependent on a star size? In another words, is the statement correct:

the bigger the star, so bigger the spots on it; if the star is smaller  smaller so is the spots accordingly. [In comparing to the Sun of course]
