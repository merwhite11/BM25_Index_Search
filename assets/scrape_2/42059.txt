How to compute for Distance Modulus' uncertainty/ies?

This is rather a short question. As we know of;
Distance Modulus (DM) $\mu = 5 \log d - 5$
If $d = 168_{-14.9}^{+27.5}$ pc ($3\sigma$ value), how can I possibly compute for $\mu$'s uncertainty?
P.S. Perhaps I need to multiply those $\pm$ values to a 'some constant'(?)
Thanks a lot and clear skies.
