What are the most recent minerals modified by water found to date on Mars?

There likely was quite a bit of liquid water on the surface of Mars less than 4 billion years ago. We know this because we found rocks that old that have been modified by the presence of water. For example :

If the martian blueberries, or hematite spherules found by Opportunity formed by slow evaporation in mineral-rich liquid water, they likely formed 3 billion years ago.
Serpentines have been detected by CRISM.
