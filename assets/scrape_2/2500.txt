Taking Advantage of Time Dilation

According to Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, one's speed in relation to a relatively stationary object would 'slow down' time on the moving object.
With this in mind, would it be possible to travel in a straight line away from Earth (stationary object) in a space craft able to travel at +90% the speed of light for 2 years and return with significant time dilation?
What technologies have we generated that could reach speeds for significant time dilation (+10 years)?
