When did astronomy first discover that the stars are bigger than the moon?

We take it for granted these days that the stars are bigger than the planets and the moons. But when you look at the sky, it does not appear this way.
The Moon looks bigger and brighter than the stars. This leads me to wonder when astronomy first discovered the relative size of the stars.

Have people believed that the Moon was bigger than the stars for a long time?

If so, where was this believed, and up until when?

What discoveries or observations led people to conclude that the stars are larger?
