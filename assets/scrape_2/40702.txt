What is the age of the universe if you were standing in a galaxy far far away such as GN-Z11?

If we agree with the universe starting from a Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, expanding at different rates governed by the Hubble constant of 67.4 km/s/Mpec, somewhere about 13.4 billion light years away a galaxy called GN-Z11 should be traveling at near the speed of light .924c and has been for about 13.8 billion years, relative to us. Applying relativity time dilation, the age of that galaxy, should, concurrent to us, be quite young, maybe 4 billion years, since its always (since the big bang) been traveling at relativistic speeds. So, in GN-Z11, is the time, since the big bang, and current state of evolution of the universe, truly much less than the time here?
More significantly is its future when its 13.8 billion, after 9.8 billion years, still unknown? I think it would be unknown because I truly think only 4 billion years could have passed there at the maximum, but the principle "that the universe has no center" tends to imply that it could be 13.8 billion years old there, and everywhere in the universe, like it is here. Which is it? Is it a fair question?
