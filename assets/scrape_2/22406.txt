Difference between fluid Love number and tidal Love number

I'm trying to understand more about tidal deformation in planets, and I frequently encounter Love numbers. However, sometimes the fluid Love number is mentioned, and sometimes the tidal Love number is mentioned. As I currently understand, the fluid Love number is the long-term behavior of the body and the tidal Love number is related to tidal frequencies.
Does it mean that the fluid Love number assumes the whole body is fluid and the tidal assumes a viscoelastic behavior? If someone can expand on the physical differences between the two I would really appreciate it.
