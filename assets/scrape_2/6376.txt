Which properties can we infer for cosmic ray particles hitting on an optical ccd?

It is very common that we meet cosmic ray particles in optical images recorded by CCDs.
You can see the "snowflakes" in the Hubble Space Telescope images below:

Generally we should try to remove them in order to get photometry or spectroscopic information.
However, there may be useful information we can derive; for example, can we get their directions or energies statistically before they arrive at a CCD?
Is there some correlation between the ADU value of a cosmic ray point and its real energy?
