Will pulsars stop spinning eventually?

In the book "Horizons: exploring the universe-Cengage learning (2018)", page 224, it states that:

When a pulsar first forms, it is spinning fast, perhaps a hundred times a second. The energy it radiates into space comes from its energy of rotation, so as it blasts beams of radiation outward,
its rotation slows.


The average pulsar is apparently only a few million years old, and the oldest are about 10 million years old. Presumably, older neutron stars rotate too slowly to generate detectable radio beams.

So will pulsars eventually stop spinning due to the energy it radiates into space? As there are no extra energy sources that give pulsars to spin. And I know the space is basically empty space, but will air resistance be a factor that slows the spinning of pulsars or other stars?
