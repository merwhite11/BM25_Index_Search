What is a "Gentle Giant" Black Hole?

I have seen articles about the Milky Way's "gentle giant" black hole. For example:

https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/black-hole-scientists-announce-groundbreaking-milky-way-galaxy-discovery-2022-05-12/

Both of these articles say the black hole is not eating very much matter, which is the only clue I have from the articles.
A similar phrase, "gentle singularity," is used in the movie Interstellar. There has been some discussion about that, in which the consensus seems to be that the size of a supermassive black hole reduces the tidal forces at the event horizon, such that a falling entity would not be spaghettified. (I acknowledge that a movie quote is far from authoritative.)
So I have two hints at a definition of "gentle giant" black hole:

A black hole that consumes little matter.
A supermassive black hole whose tidal forces will not cause spaghettification.

Is either of these correct? If not, is there an authoritative definition of a "gentle giant" black hole?
