How do the phases of Venus prove heliocentrism?

I have been doing research about the Copernican Revolution, and one of the main arguments that caused many astronomers to change their minds was Galileo's observation of all phases of Venus.
The proof goes somewhat like this:
If Venus revolved around the earth, closer to the earth than the sun, then we should never be abe to see Venus when it is full, because the light side should always be facing the sun, which is away from Earth. Therefore Venus must be orbitging the sun.
Reality:

Expected observations if Venus orbited the Earth:

My problem is this: Why can't we, in a geocentric model, see Venus when it is full if Earth is between Venus and the Sun? If the Sun and Venus orbit in rings around the Earth, then surely there must be a point when the Sun is on one side of the Earth and Venus is on the other, and the Sun illuminates the side of Venus facing Earth, making the Venus full?
