Is it possible that quasars are not powered by black holes but some other kind of compact, massive object?

AFAIK, objects in the universe thought to be black holes show evidence of radiatively inefficient accretion flow. But is this the case with Quasars? If not, is there a possibility that the core of a quasar is an object similar to a neutron star.
