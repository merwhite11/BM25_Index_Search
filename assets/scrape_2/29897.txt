Terminology for empty space at the edge of the observable universe?

Is there a name for a point at the edge of the observable universe at which there is no visible matter, that appears completely dark?
I'm thinking something like "empty space", but that could equally apply to an empty void between galaxies, which isn't quite what I'm looking for.
So it would refer to a theoretical line in space from the observer to the edge of the universe which contains no visible matter. Is there a term for this?
