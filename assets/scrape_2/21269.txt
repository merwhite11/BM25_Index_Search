how much further can a radio telescope than an optical telescope

I know that radio telescope can 'see'* further than an optical telescope but I would like to know how much further? (let's say the optical has a magnification of 50x and the radio has a dish of 90m in diameter).
*When I say see I mean how far into space image wise.
