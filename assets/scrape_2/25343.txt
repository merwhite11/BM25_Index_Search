Are red moons possible without eclipses or smoke from fires?

This morning I was on the bus and as I looked out of the window I saw that the moon was larger than usual and red. I live in eastern Norway and it was about -20ºF / 30ºC outside. There's no forest fires, and I live in a small village. There's no eclipse scheduled either. The moon went behind the mountain line before I got to school ( bus ride happened  7:03 - 7:20 ), and nobody there had seen it. Can you explain this?
