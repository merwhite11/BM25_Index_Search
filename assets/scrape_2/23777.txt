Why most planets don't spin retrograde?

Edit: just found duplicate
Since orbital velocity is greater on small orbits, and smaller on large orbits, why don't planets spin retrograde around their own axis? 
One portion of planet's mass is closer to its star, and should move prograde relative to center of mass. 
Part of the planet's mass far from the star orbits higher and should move retrograde relative to center of mass, 
which should create a resulting retrograde spin, with rotation speed depending on planet's diameter.
What's wrong with this? ( since fact is : most planets spin prograde )


In this not to scale second illustration, planet is replaced by two masses linked by a beam. Kepler's law of equal surfaces swept per unit of time is used
to display the retrograde rotational force that should be applied relative to center of mass, which orbits black path.
EDIT : Ok I think I found where my mistake is(?) Differential gravitational pull (yellow arrows) counteracts retrograde rotational force (green arrow) Which results in no rotational force at all. Anyway I still don't get how conservation of momentum of everything orbiting the sun, also applies to spin direction of orbiting objects.
