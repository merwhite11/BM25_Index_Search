Can there be an object with planetary discriminant between Ceres and Neptune?

The planetary discriminant is a measure of how dominant a body is within its region of the solar system. For (true) planets, it is $>10000$ and for dwarf planets it is $<1$. (See this answer to "How many planets are there in this solar system?" which explains the related details.)
Is it possible, given what has already been observed about our solar system, for there to be an object with  "planetary discriminant" Âµ between that of Ceres and Neptune?   In other words, could the clear cut line between planets and dwarf planets get fuzzier?   
Obviously it would have to be a massive body pretty far out.  Is there a region in the solar system which could be devoid enough of many small objects, which also could be home to a large enough body that we also haven't observed yet?   How does the math work out?
