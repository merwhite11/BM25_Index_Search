Can anyone one show how speeds greater than c cause a paradox on a space time diagram?

So according to Relativity, time moves at different rates for different observers, and distant observers will actually disagree on the order of events.  Now from what I gather this gets sorted out for objects with relative speeds less than c, but would ultimately cause a paradox for anything moving faster because it would time travel.  However, I don't really see how.  On a spacetime diagram light always moves at a 45째 angle, or at least some angle between 0째 and 90째, and the only way I see anything effecting the past is if something moves at an angle greater than 90째.
So can someone please give a visual representation that explains the issue?
