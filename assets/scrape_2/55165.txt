Is there a list of the reguarly-appearing planets, moons, and stars which move fastest across the sky?

I just want to be able to explore their speeds across the sky from the POV of a person on Earth, say from the Northern Hemisphere if it matters. And ideally the list would have their speeds, not just a ranking.
