Why black holes look black to us?

Why black holes look black to us?
The question might sound weird but my head stuck in it. As we know objects that fall into the black holes seem to remain unchanged in its event horizon due to the nature that lights cannot escape from it. For example, in the below image (image with white astronaut) of the black hole we will see the astronaut remains in its event horizon.

Now, we also know that the black holes are constantly pulling all the interstellar objects & meteors around it, thus if these objects are grabbed by the black hole, we are supposed to see many of these objects remain unchanged on its event horizon surface hence the color of the black hole is not supposed to be black instead the distorted color by the objects (i.e. below image). But still we see its color a pure black in most of the representations and photos.

So why do we see black holes black instead of distorted colors of the space objects?
