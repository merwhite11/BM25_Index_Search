Where can I find Arecibo's data archive?

Does anyone know where I can find Arecibo's historical data? After much searching, I can find neither hide nor hair of it. It doesn't help that the search results are completely dominated by the news of the relatively recent collapse of the telescope and I didn't come up with anything through their Science Portal.
