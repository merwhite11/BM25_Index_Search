What is the **actual** average distance of the Moon from Earth?

The Moon orbits Earth at a semi-major axis of 384400 km, with its periapsis being 363300 km and apoapsis being 405500 km. (All figures from this NASA fact sheet.)
If the Moon orbited Earth at a constant velocity, the average distance would be 384,400 km. Unfortunately, as Kepler found out, celestial objects move faster near periapsis and slower at apoapsis.
This means that the Moon's actual average distance from Earth is slightly bigger than 384400 km, due to it having a lower orbital velocity when farther from Earth.
So, what is the Moon's actual average distance from Earth? Is there a formula (I'm assuming including calculus) that would give a solution to any two-body-system?
