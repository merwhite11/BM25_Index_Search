What's the most distant radio message we could detect with today's radio telescopes, if the message is initially broadcasted in all directions?

An additional assumption is that broadcasting the message may require using a medium-sized star, like the Sun, for an hour, by e.g. Dysoning it.
I don't know enough to answer the question myself. If the question needs more details filled in to be well-formed, you can make additional assumptions.
