Does the north pole of the Solar System (with respect to the invariable plane) point towards the galactic center?

How is our Solar System as a whole (not the wobbly Earth) tilted with respect to the invariable plane of the Milky Way?
I understand our Sun's north pole is largely pointing towards our direction of orbit around the Milky Way, (I think), but, how much is it tilted (if at all) with respect to the 'north' or 'south' of the galaxy?
When other sites say we are tilted about 60° to 62° or so, which direction do they mean?
