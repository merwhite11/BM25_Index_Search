How would the combined masses of the Centaurs or the scattered disk compare to the combined mass of the asteroid belt?

I'm interested in finding the combined mass of the Centaurs and the scattered disk. I looked around but I wasn't able to find any estimates. This seems to suggest that either the combined masses of the Centaurs or the scattered disk are negligible in comparison to that of the asteroid belt, or nobody ever thought of making an estimate. All I could find was that the asteroid belt is approximately 0.04 moon masses and that the Jupiter Trojans are approximately 1/5 of the mass of the asteroid belt. My feeling is that these combined masses should be way more than that of the Jupiter Trojans.  
Thank you in advance, and yes, I tried Wiki.
