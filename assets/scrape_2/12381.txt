What happens to oxygen produced on the Sun (or other stars)?

Through nuclear fusion, the Sun can (or at the very least, someday will) produce atoms of all elements up to and including oxygen.  And in terrestrial chemistry at least, when you combine oxygen, hydrogen, and a small amount of heat you get water.  Or lithium and oxygen and heat will produce lithium oxide.  Those individual components are all readily available in a star like the Sun.
So my questions is, does the oxygen produced by the Sun (or any other star, now, in the future, or in the past) react chemically (for instance, through oxidation or combustion processes) with the other elements present in the star's atmosphere?  
Or I suppose more generally, do the elements formed through nuclear fusion in a star chemically interact to produce more complex molecules (and if not, then why not)?
