How to get JPL Ephemeris data to work in n-body simulation or why is Mercury flying to Jupiter

I wanted to make a n-body simulation for an art project.
I used this n-body algorithm, which includes a stable system for the Sun + gas giants, but no inner planets.
I wanted to simulate inner planets as well, so took JPL data from Horizons in AU and days and plugged it into the system.  But, it doesn't create stable orbits.
Is using this data in a 64-bit float n-body simulation a fools errand?
Is there a better way to get this data for all planets + Pluto + Chiron?  Thanks!
