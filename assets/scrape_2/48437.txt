How soon would an earth-mass black hole evaporate?

A raft of related questions:

Is an Earth-mass black hole even possible?
Assuming Hawking Radiation (HR) is a fact (has it been verified yet?), would HR cause an earth-mass black hole to evaporate quickly, not so quickly, or after a long time?
How intense would the energy generated by the HR of such a black hole be, even without additional matter falling into it?
If you know a way to calculate it, what would be the diameter of the event horizon of such a black hole?
