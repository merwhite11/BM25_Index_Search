How to detect emission lines in optical spectra?

Is there any handy module to detect emission lines in a spectrum like one we get from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)?
You can see there are many emission lines like Ha,OI in the spectrum below. In fact the spectrum is a two column data set, wavelength and flux. It is a combination of lots of scatter points. The typical interval between two points nearyby is 1.5 angstroms. I need to find all the Gaussian bumps and their line center.
So,first I need to find the the bumps and then I need to fit them to get their centers.
