Why is the Milky Way today about the same diameter as the visible universe was when recombination happened 378000 years after the Big Bang?

Has the Milky Way undergone an expansion of space time independent of the universe as a whole or did the gas that created the Milky Way heat up and expand? Whatever the answer, why the current diameter ?
