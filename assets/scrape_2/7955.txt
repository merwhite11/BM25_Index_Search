The defintion of star/planetary/solar system

In many science fiction stories, we hear the term star system that mostly refers to a star and its planets. This is often used interchangeably with the term solar system. But after some research I understand this:
Planetary system refers specifically to anything orbiting a star that is not a star itself. According to Wikipedia, this generally refers to the planets, but may include other objects like asteroids and dwarf planets. It does not refer to the star itself.
Star system refers to any system with two (binary) or more (multiple) stars, but only the stars themselves, not planets or anything else.
Solar system generally refers to our own Solar system but there are situations where "solar system" (lowercase) refers to a star and the planets or other objects orbiting it (as long as something orbits the star).
So, is it incorrect to use the term solar system/star system to refer to a star and its planets?
