Would it be possible to detect a magnetic field around an exoplanet?

Of course, we can't fly a magnetometer next to an exoplanet to measure the magnetic field, but might it be possible to find indirect evidence (e.g. polar auroras) of a magnetic field generated by an exoplanet? Has this already been done?
