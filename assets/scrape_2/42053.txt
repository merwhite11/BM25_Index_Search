What pulls the Sun above the galactic plane and pulls it below the galactic plane?

Since the sun climbs above the galactic plane and it even dives below the galactic plane we can't deny that it wouldn't climb upward unless there is something above the galactic plane that pulls it upward as well as something beneath the galactic plane that pulls it downward though it is invisible. Though we don't know how to explore what is it that pulls the sun upward or downward should we not admit that we can't find out what it is instead of saying that nothing exists above or below the galactic plane? Can we agree though there may be a parallel universe above and below the galactic plane, we have no means to explore their existence?
