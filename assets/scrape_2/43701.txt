What is this pale blue dot in a daytime photo of a Sun halo?

This photo of the sun behind a cloud was taken on the south coast of England in early May 2021 using an iPhone 11. A halo is visible which I think is the 22-degree halo. However, the photo also shows a small, pale blue dot near the middle of the photo, within the photo, left and above the Sun. Please could somebody suggest what the blue dot is?
