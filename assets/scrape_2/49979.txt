Is there something close to a consensus on Earth-Sun annual distance increase (speed)?

I've seen estimates varying by an order of magnitude, e.g. (New Scientist)

Having such a precise yardstick allowed Russian dynamicists Gregoriy A. Krasinsky and Victor A. Brumberg to calculate, in 2004, that the sun and Earth are gradually moving apart. It’s not much – just 15 cm per year – but since that’s 100 times greater than the measurement error, something must really be pushing Earth outward.

I double-checked the paper and there's no typo in New Scientist, as far as I can tell. Krasinsky and Brumberg give it as "15 ± 4 m/cy" (which is 15 cm/year; "cy" is almost certainly 100 years in that context.)
Whereas another astrophysicist, Ethan Siegel, writing in Forbes in 2019 claims it's only 1.5 cm/year.

This year, 2019, our perihelion was 1.5 centimeters farther away than it was last year, which was more distant than the year before, etc.

The same figure (1.5 cm) appears in an undated Cornell FAQ page. So, is there a consensus established in the meantime that the true rate is (close to) the latter 1.5 cm/year? What experiments/models/papers is the latter based on?
