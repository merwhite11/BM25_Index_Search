Equation of time with arbitrary eccentricity and obliquity

I'm working on an on-line app to show the Equation of Time for arbitrary eccentricity and obliquity of the Earth's orbit.
It looks good for small eccentricities and obliquities:

but for bigger ones the components of the Equation (the so called Equation of the Center and Projection to the Equator) loose all the "sine-like" look:

I don't know if that is the expected behaviour; if it is, I would like to undestand why. :)
Thank you very much!

Edit (in response of the excellent analysis of d_e):
I compute the two curves independently; in other words, ignoring the effect of one on the other. After reading d_e's answer, I see now that there's a problem with it. But first, I make explicit the methods I used:
Equation of Center
For the Equation of Center I compute the difference between the mean anomaly ($M$) and the true anomaly ($\nu$). The mean anomaly is the angle between the perihelion and the position of a fictitious Earth, moving in a circle -whose radius is the semi-major axis of the Earth's orbit- with constant velocity, with vertex in the center of that circle. The true anomaly is the angle between the perihelion and the real Earth, with the Sun at its vertex.
The mean anomaly is easy; for the true anomaly I compute first the eccentric anomaly ($E$) using Kepler's equation:
$E=M+e\sin E$, where $e$ is the eccentricity. I use a fixed-point iteration.
Then I get the true anomaly with
$\tan\frac{\nu}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}\tan\frac{E}{2}$
Reduction to the Equator
For the Reduction to the Equator I compute the difference between a fictitiuos Earth moving with constant velocity along the plane of the Equator ($\lambda$) and the projection to the Equator of another fictitious mean Earth, moving with constant velocity in a circle inclined an angle $i$ with respect to the Equator ($\alpha$).
For $\lambda$, I compute the mean anomaly, but counting from the vernal equinox (*: see below). For $\alpha$, I use the spherical trigonometry relation:
$\tan \alpha = \frac{\sin \lambda \cos i}{\cos \lambda}$
(I don't use $\tan \alpha = \tan \lambda \cos i$ because I employ the function atan(a,b) for getting the correct quadrant).
(*) After d_e's analysis, now I think that this is a mistake: I should
use the true anomaly as a value for $\lambda$, and then project that to get $\alpha$... am I right?
This is a screenshot of the case (as is) of the app when $e$ is low but $i$ is high:

By the way, the app is up an running; if you want to change values yourself and see the results, it's here: on-line app of Equation of Time (as is)

Second Edit:
I changed the way of computing the Equation of Center according to the analysis of d_e. Now I think it's visually clear that the time between equinoxes is not half a year apart when $e$ is big. :)

I updated the on-line version of the app.
I think that now it correctly represents the effects of arbitrary inclination and eccentricity in the Equation of Time... Â¡Thank you very much! I could not have done it alone.
