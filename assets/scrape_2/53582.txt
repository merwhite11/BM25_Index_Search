Apart from higher costs, drawbacks of catadioptric telescope vs Newtonians?

From what I've read, catadioptric telescopes seem to be superior to reflectors. They tend to require less frequent collimations, are generally shorter in physical length, and the combination of lenses and mirrors provide greater aberration correction.
Apart from their higher costs due to the presence of lenses, what other drawbacks might a catadioptric telescope have that would cause one to opt for a reflector instead?
