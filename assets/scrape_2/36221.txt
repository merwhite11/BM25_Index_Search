Hello again, Barlow Lenses

I am debating if I should buy a 2x Barlow Lens. My telescope, a go-to Meade star navigator, has an aperture of 114mm, focal length of 1000mm and I currently have a 9 and 26mm eyepieces. I want to see Jupiter and Saturn better specifically, but I wonder if such a lens is worth it.
