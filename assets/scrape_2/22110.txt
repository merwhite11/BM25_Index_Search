Possible to make a cheap reflective objective lens with a mirror?

Sounds kinda crazy and cheap but has anyone ever tried to take a flexible (plastic) mirror and attach a string to the back side then pull the string so it makes a concave surface? I realize it wouldn't be the most accurate device in the world, but if I wanted to build a telescope with a child I think it would be a cheap and fun way to make it. Thoughts?
