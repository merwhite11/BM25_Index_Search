What is the temperature under the surface of Mercury?

What is the temperature under the surface of Mercury?  I know at the surface the temperature varies greatly (-297 F to 801 F).  I also realize that the answer would likely depend on depth.  Do we know the temperature at any depth, except the surface?  I also realize the temperature may vary based on latitude.  I am mainly looking to see if there might be an ideal location / depth for a colony on Mercury for my game Planetary Settlers.
