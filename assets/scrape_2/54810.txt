When did astronomers accept that fixed stars aren't fixed and are at different distances?

Was it when heliocentric model was spreading in the whole world? I saw a model of the solar system that was made in the 18th century where the sun was in the middle and the planets and comets around it and the end it said: "firmament of fixed stars". Wasn't at that time accepted that stars were suns or atleast not attached to any firmament and fixed?
