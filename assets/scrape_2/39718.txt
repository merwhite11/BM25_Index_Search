Would alcohol wiping damage multi-coated eyepiece coating? How else can I take COVID precautions on the eyepiece?

My small group of friends will be wearing masks. But could COVID-19 be spread by eyes/eyelashes touching the eyepiece? If so, what precautions should I take?
I have a small Starblast scope with an Orion E-Series 7-21mm Zoom Eyepiece which "consists of six lens elements, which are fully multi-coated with anti-reflection coatings for bright and clear views, rich in contrast." Would 70% alcohol wipes damage the coating? Would it matter if it's isopropyl alcohol or ethanol alcohol?
