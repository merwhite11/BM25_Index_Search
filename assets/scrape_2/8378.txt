Why do comets come from our local Oort cloud instead of from interstellar sources?

Comets form where stars form. And they are then ejected by the orbital changes of giant planets. But why are they ejected to form specifically a local Oort cloud instead of going interstellar and becoming vagabonds? The fact that comets come from all directions doesn't discriminate between them coming from an Oort cloud or from interstellar sources.
The main argument against the idea of one star capturing a comet from another star, seems to be that the relative velocity is too high for that. But consider the huge age of the Sun which is now on its 18th or so orbit through this crowded galactic star field disc. And which by chance or co-formation might have now, or at some earlier time, roughly the same velocity as some other millions of other stars. And what if there are many (many) more comets formed and/or ejected from young stars than currently supposed?
Is it really unlikely that the Oort "cloud of comets" instead largely represents an interstellar source?
