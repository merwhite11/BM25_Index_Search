Are circumbinary and noncircumbinary habitable zones mutually exclusive?

Could a binary star system have an earth-like planet orbiting star A, a second earth-like planet orbiting star B, AND a third earth-like planet in a stable circumbinary orbit? Or does the space that is required between the two stars to allow for stable habitable zone orbits for the first two planets eliminate the possibility of the third planet being both habitable and in a stable circumbinary orbit?
