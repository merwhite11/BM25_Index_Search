What is the likelyhood that planet X is a glass (not a typo for gas) planet? What would it mean if it were for what we know of astronomy?

Scientists have been looking for an explanation for the unusual orbits of extreme  trans-neptunian objects.  One of the possible explanations some astrophysicists have come up with was the possibility of Planet X.  However, no one has been able to find planet X.  What is the possibility that planet X is a spherical glass planet (not a typo, I actually mean SiO2), thus the reason behind why optical telescopes have not been able to find it.
What are the possible implications if we were to find it, to our current knowledge of astronomy and planet formation?
