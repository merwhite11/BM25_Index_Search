What is $\omega$ and $\tau$ in this celestial sphere

In the celestial sphere below, what is the $\omega$ and $\tau$ physically? I mean, In the normal world, how do we see them? for example, we can see the altitude of the sun (a) by examining the shadow of a pillar and comparing it with its height, How do we see $\omega$ and $\tau$ in real world?
S is the sun and W is the west.
Also  I want to know how do they effect on the shadow of wall which is built in direction of "$SCP$ to $NCP$".
