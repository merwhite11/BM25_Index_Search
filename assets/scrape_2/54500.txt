Light object shakily falling downwards and then fading and disappearing after a minute

The objects that I see seem to didder downward or across the sky for a minute until the light fades completely. They did not move in a straight trajectory, rather pivoting from side to side. I saw this a few times in the Berkshires mountains in June. Also in New Jersey this past month. Iâ€™m wondering if it is in fact a satellite or something else. I have never heard of a satellite moving this way.
