Is stellar ignition all-or-nothing?

The boundary between brown dwarfs and stars is around 80 Jupiter masses. Only stars generate a self-sustaining hydrogen fusion, although brown dwarfs sometimes fuse lithium and deuterium.
Is hydrogen ignition all or nothing? If so, there should be a mass overlap. For example, a 79 Jupiter mass star may achieve ignition by forming faster and thus with a higher core temperature, or by having a bit more deuterium or lithium kindling than normal. Conversely, a slowly-forming 81 Jupiter mass brown dwarf may stay below ignition temperatures.
The heaviest brown dwarf we know has about 90 Jupiter masses, while the lightest star has about 73 Jupiter masses, which suggests a mass overlap, although these masses are approximate values. Is there any estimate to how big this mass overlap is?
Edit: To clarify my question: Stars above about 0.35 solar masses have a radiative envelope so end their life with some unburnt hydrogen. Stars below 0.35 solar masses burn all of their hydrogen b/c they are fully convective. Brown dwarfs (say of 0.05 solar masses) don't burn any light hydrogen. Are there individual objects (presumably around 80 Jupiter masses) that are between 0.05 and 0.35 solar masses and are destined to one day end their life with 10% of their hydrogen burnt? Or with 25%? Or with 50%? This is of course barring any outside catastrophic event like being torn apart by a black hole.
