Is Higgs Boson mass equal to the missing mass of dark matter?

Sorry if this is a very lay question. I am just an armchair physicist.
The Higgs Boson was just recently discovered, and it has a mass which is considerably larger than a proton. If this Higgs Boson was just recently discovered and the Higgs Boson is EVERYWHERE (ie. The Higgs Field), why wouldn't this perfectly explain the missing mass that is "dark matter" ?
