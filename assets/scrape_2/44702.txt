How big is the Lorentz force on the Sun?

The LOFAR observations have made an estimate of the magnetic field of the Milky Way. The value in our region is very small. About 1/1000 of the Earth magnetic field.
The Earth and the Sun move at a cosiderable speed around the center of the Milky Way though. Both move with a speed of around 828 000 km/hr around the center of the Milky Way.
Now currents moving in a magnetic field experience a Lorentz force:
$$F_{l}=-qv\times B$$
Where $q$ is the charge, $v$ the speed of the charge, and $B$ the magnetic field the charges move in. The force is always perpendicular to the velocity.
Now on the Sun, as well as inside the Earth, there is a net current giving rise to their magnetic fields. This means there is a net current in the direction of motion around our galaxy.
How big would be the force on the Sun moving through the magnetic field of the Milky Way?
