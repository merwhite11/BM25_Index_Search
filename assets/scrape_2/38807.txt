What was the size of the universe around 400 million years after the Big Bang?

I was trying to find out how large the universe was around 400 million years after the Big Bang as this is when some of the first galaxies were formed but I am having trouble finding out the answer or working it out.
I found some information on the size of the universe after 380,000 years when the CMB was created and by calculating the red shift from the time of creation a size of roughly 80 million light years is given by reducing the observable universes size by a factor of 1100 but I am not sure how to use this to calculate the universes size after 400 million years and I am not sure if as the above calculation is for the observable universe how that related to the actual size.
Is the size of the universe in terms of its length or diameter known or can be calculated after 400 million years from the Big Bang event?
