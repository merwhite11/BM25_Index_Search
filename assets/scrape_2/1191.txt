How does the Milky Way look like above 66° North and below 66° South?

I read on Wikipedia:

depending on the time of night and the year, the arc of Milky Way can
  appear relatively low or relatively high in the sky. For observers
  from about 65 degrees north to 65 degrees south on the Earth's surface
  the Milky Way passes directly overhead twice a day

What happens and how does the Milky Way look like out of that range?
If it matters, consider also the all-summer light and the dark winter.
