What Is The Maximum Distance Our Finest Instruments Could See When They're Perfected?

Radius of the observable universe is 47.5 billion light years,which means we are seeing things which are about 48 billion light years away. At a rough estimate,at what distance would our finest instruments and telescopes be unable to see or detect anything at all,& is there anything in the idea that if we were able to see far enough,we might see our own galaxy as it appears from an immense distance,its light having circled the universe? And as space is not a perfect vacuum,wouldn't the light be significantly retarded by the end of such a long journey?
