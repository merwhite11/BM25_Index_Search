Which quantum reality will be seen in a future Earth

If we orbit near a black hole to travel to future and come back to Earth, which of the quantum realities will be observed in the future Earth?
My question is regarding many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics according to which multiple alternate futures are possible https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation
