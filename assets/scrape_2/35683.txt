How can the radius of a star be measured using parallax?

The radius of Betelgeuse was measured using parallax. From the Wikipedia article:

the estimated parallax from the Hipparcos mission was 7.63Â±1.64 mas, yielding an estimated radius for Betelgeuse of 3.6 AU. 

I understand how a distance can be determined using parallax, but I don't understand how the radius can.
What is the math behind deriving a radius from a parallax measurement?
