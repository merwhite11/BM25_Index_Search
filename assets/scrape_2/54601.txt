Why is the Department of Defense so sure CNEOS 2014 is from outside the solar system?

From what I could understand the speed of 45 km/sec was one of the characteristics that lead to the conclusion that CNEOS 2014 is extra solar. I assume the object had to be tracked by NORAD in 2014? But why couldn't it have origined from an impact ejection right in our solar system?
If a meteor hits an object in our solar system with sufficient impact couldn't that have accelerated the fragments to 45 km/sec?
If true that is pretty remarkable detective work not to mention luck that we found one after so many years of radar searching. ( Not that anyone was actually looking for it, I imagine they are constantly looking for nukes. )
