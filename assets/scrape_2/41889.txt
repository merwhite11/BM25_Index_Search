How important is where you get your PhD?

I know that in some fields it is very important to earn a PhD from a top school if your goal is to achieve competitive postdoc offers. How true is this in pursuing a career in astronomy/astrophysics? How possible is it to have a successful career (e.g to achieve a highly-paid, tenured faculty position in a great department) with a PhD from a mid-rank school? I would love any insights from early-career astronomers.
