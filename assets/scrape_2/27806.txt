Does time dilation increase within overlapping gravitational fields?

If a spaceship was to travel to the barycenter of a binary star (the stars having identical size and mass) and come to a stop there, would the people on board this spaceship find that time is moving slower there (relative to the passage of time experienced outside of the gravitational fields of this binary star) due to the two stars overlapping gravitational fields at this point in space?
