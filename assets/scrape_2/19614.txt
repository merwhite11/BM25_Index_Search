Is the universe considered to be flat?

I've read various articles and books (like this one) stating that we are not certain about the geometry of the universe, but there were experiments on-going or planned that would help us find out.
Recently though, I've watched a lecture by cosmologist Lawrence Krauss where he seems to categorically assert that the universe has been proven to be flat by the BOOMERanG experiment. Here's the relevant portion of the talk.
I've looked around and there are still articles stating that we still don't know the answer to this question, like this one.
So, my question is two-fold:

Am I mixing concepts and talking about different things?
If not then is this evidence not widely accepted by some reason? What reason would that be?
