Total mass of light?

I know that light is considered as energy, and as such has a mass. 
So it is certainly taken into account in universes models and calculations. 
So I'm wondering: How much of the total mass of the universe does light and electromagnetic waves accounts for? And how much does it contributes to its expansion? 
Is it positive or negative? Since it is considered as mass only, it should decrease expansion somehow. Am I right about this?
