What is this 877-year cycle in the orbits of Jupiter & Saturn, and this multimillion-year cycle in the lunar orbit?

The book The Theory That Would Not Die (by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne, 2011) states the following on page 28:

He [Pierre-Simon Laplace] used other methods between 1785 and 1788 to determine that Jupiter and Saturn oscillate gently in an 877-year cycle around the sun and that the moon orbits Earth in a cycle millions of years long.

What are the two cycles mentioned here? What exactly happens every 877 years in the orbits of Jupiter & Saturn, and every so many millions of years in the lunar orbit?

For Jupiter & Saturn, my searching finds no cycles longer than the 20-year cycle of great conjunctions.

For the moon, my searching finds no cycles in the lunar orbit longer than 19 years.
