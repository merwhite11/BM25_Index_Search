What are the correct positions or alignment of planets in relation to each other and the Sun, is it vertical center, baseline or completely random

From a lot a illustrations and videos, the planets seem to align in vertical center to each other like this:

Is this really true? I like to imagine that the planets are actually in weird alignment to each other, for example, maybe Venus is 50,000Km below earths bottom etc
