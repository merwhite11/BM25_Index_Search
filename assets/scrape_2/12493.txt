Visibility of human activity on the moon

In this video the host of Test Tube Plus states that

you can go out a buy a laser, point it at the moon, and see the retroreflector left by the astronauts.  When you point at the right spot you'll see a reflection, elsewhere not.  He reiterates that this is not just a hypothetical use of 2nd person for effect, but that you the viewer can go out and try this yourself, and anyone paying any attention to moonlanding conspiracy theories ought to try it
tracks and artefacts at the landing site can be seen with amateur telescopes, and again this is approachable to anyone who cares to look

Neither of these seem correct to me.  Could someone with real numbers weigh in on this?
I seem to recall that seeing artefacts is only possible in the latest high-res images taken from lunar orbit, and the telescope that uses the reflector gets back single photons on some trials and is a much more powerful laser than you could buy!  But, a continuous beam may be different? How big of a laser would you need to see a reflection with a viewing instrument that doesn't cost more than the laser?
