How does the Eddington limit make the gravitational field of stars asymmetric?

This answer to Is the gravitational field of the sun uniform? says:

Very large stars are asymmetric due to being close to the Eddington limit. The Sun is too small of a star to have the kind of gravitational anomalies that very large stars and rocky planets exhibit.

which is really interesting but leaves me unsatisfied.
Question: How exactly does the Eddington limit make the gravitational field of stars asymmetric?


What does Eddington Limit (Eddington Luminosity) Show?

From wikipedia:

Eddington luminosity
Humphreysâ€“Davidson limit
