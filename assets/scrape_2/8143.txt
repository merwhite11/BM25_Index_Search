Are our 'observations' of or near a black hole affected by gravity induced time dilation?

This answer made me wonder if matter/energy/events near a black hole are viewed (by us) in a very different time frame, how might that affect our measurements?
The people on the smaller planet would observe the people on the extremely large planet 
moving in "slow motion". (note: due to gravitational time dilation)

On a related note, does light being 'bent' around a black hole experience time dilation or red/blue shift from our viewing perspective? (as possibly suggested by this answer).
