Would a Einstein–Rosen bridge change size and/or position in an expanding Universe?

I appreciate that a Einstein–Rosen bridge has never been observed but since there are some valid theories in General Relativity I thought I'd ask this.
Would the start and end point of a Einstein–Rosen bridge change in an expanding Universe or would the whole thing stretch but retain it's start and end position?
