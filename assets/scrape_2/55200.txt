Realistic description of a sunrise viewed from the asteroid belt?

I'm writing a scene for a short story and wanted to describe a sunrise scene acurately.
If someone was in some sort of craft in the asteroid belt and their craft was coming out from behind an asteroid, could a passenger experience a visual like the Milky Way fading into nothing?
I've seen photos of the Milky Way from the ISS as well as pictures from probes like Galileo which show pitch black around a brightly lit asteroid.
My inference is that when on the dark side of a sufficiently large celestial body, the Milky Way would be visible, but as soon as you're in, or near, line of sight to the Sun, the light pollution acts similarly, or more intensely than, on Earth.
Is this the case? And if so, how far away from the Sun would you have to be to maintain unobstructed line of sight to the Sun but still see the Milky Way's band of starsâ€”would you have to leave the Solar System?
