On the cosmological principle

Just more of a conceptual question on the mutual inclusivity of the cosmological principle. That is to say, I was wondering if it were possible to have a Universe that were isotropic but NOT homogeneous OR a Universe that were homogeneous but NOT isotropic. 
My spidey sense is telling me that it is possible that a Universe could be istropic but not homoegenous.
Surely, by default, if a Universe is homogenous then it follows that it has to be isotropic?
