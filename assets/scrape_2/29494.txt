Properties of low-mass stellar remnants vs the Earth

How does the Earth differ from a (low-mass) stellar remnant, which has stopped fusion and the outer layers of which have been blown away?
Could a stellar remnant end up with a similar relative abundance of elements as the Earth?

i.e. Is it possible that a star loses so much matter when it dies that the remnant doesn't turn into degenerate forms of matter?
