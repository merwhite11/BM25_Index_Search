Is it Possible for Planetary Bodies To Exist In Close Proximity Without Adverse Effects?

There are several sci-fi movies where planetary bodies are shown in the sky in order to indicate that the characters are on an alien planet. A good example is in Predators (2010):

Is it actually possible for such planetary bodies to exist so close to each other as to be visible in such detail to the naked eye? Wouldn't gravitational forces cause disruptions on them that inhibit the development of life (whether plant or animal)? In our Solar system there's a good example in Io which has severe volcanic activity resulting from tidal heating due to its proximity to Jupiter.
