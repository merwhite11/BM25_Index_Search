Is it a star or something else

I was lying down with my face up looking at the stars. Then I saw this star moving:

it was moving at one direction (just like airplane) 
it's light was not blinking, just exactly as other stars both In color, brightness, size
it took around 90 seconds before it disappeared from my view. 

This happened in eastern Nigeria 
What could it be? If it's a star what kind of star is that?
