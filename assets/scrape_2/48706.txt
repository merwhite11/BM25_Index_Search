Have we observed any static neutron stars?

Neutron stars are one type of remnant of a giant star's core after its collapse. Neutron stars tend to rotate at very high speed and the mismatch between its axis of rotation and magnetic pole make it a "pulsar". Over time, the rotational energy is lost and may come to a static state, no rotation.
