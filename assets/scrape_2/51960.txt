How to calculate the distance from earth and Vega in 1000 years?

Hello I read that Vega is getting closer to earth.
I would like to learn how to calculate its displacement and calculate the galactic coordinates that it will have next year or in 1000 years.
Knowing that it will not be accurate or true ^^
