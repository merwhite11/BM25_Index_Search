Is it possible to throw a camera attached to a rope within the event-horizon of a black hole and then pull it back in?

I have heard that when something passes the event-horizon of a black hole nothing can stop it from getting pulled in. Is that true for objects partially past the event-horizon? Would it be possible to attach a camera to a stick or rope, put it inside the event-horizon, take a picture, and pull it back up and look at the picture?
