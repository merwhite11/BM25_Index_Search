What components (parts) are needed to connect telescope to DSLR?

I have several years of experience with DSLR photography and some astro photography (milkyway) with DSLR. Recently, my wife gifted me an explore scientific ED80 APO telescope. I have an old Nikon D7000. I would like to get started with astrophotography as well, I know I need a T-ring to connect DSLR to telescope. However, are there additional parts needed? I searched and found that I might also need T-ring adapter or a field flattener, in addition to the T-ring. Is this necessary? Please let me know. Any help and guidance is appreciated.
