Coordinates of known black holes in our Galaxy (Milky Way)

There are some articles in wikipedia with the list of known (or candidates) black holes here and list of nearest black holes. Also there is a map of Milky Way.
My question is where can I get approximate position of the known black holes in our Galaxy (Milky Way) as Galactic coordinate system or maybe some other galaxy coordinates?
