How do I estimate the difference in the speed of time flow between Earth and a distant star?

I can use data from Gaia Mission to estimate radial velocity(from RVS) and proper motion(from parallax), to take into account special relativity. The remaining question is what data should I use to estimate gravitational effects on time flow.
For example, how much faster/slower time passes for a star that is hundred light years closer to the galactic center than Earth?
It is reasonable to assume that there are at least a few big components of the gravitational field there.

The gravity of the star itself
The gravity of the surrounding galaxy.

The star's gravity is more or less possible to estimate, by estimating its mass. Good sources of data for this are very welcome.
For the second component, I have no idea.
This is not a research question, so the result should be believable, but not necessarily scientifically correct.
The baseline is to use Neuton's gravity law for a massive disk with an average density close to the average density of the Milky Way. I suspect that there are some ways to improve this estimation.

P.S. If there are better data sources for true velocities of the distant stars feel free to point them out.
