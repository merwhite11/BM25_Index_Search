What color is a red dwarf star?

I read recently that a red dwarf star might actually look white.   I realize there's a wide range in red dwarf surface temperature, 2,500 to 3,500 degrees K, compared to 5,778 for our Sun.   Metal at 2,500 degrees K is nearly white hot with just traces of yellow.   Is that true for 93% hydrogen 7% helium as well?   Would the color of red dwarf stars be closer to yellow/white rather than red based on our vision, if we were to be close enough to get a good look?
