Is it a coincidence that on the far side of the moon almost no seas are visible?

Sorry for the maybe too large pictures. They do make the surface structures of both sides of the moon visible though. Is it just a coincidence that on the side facing us is so much sea is visible?
It looks as if on the far side more meteorites have hit the surface.
On the other hand, some pretty big ones seem to have hit the side we see. You can see there are overlapping circles containing flat and dark grounds, the seas.
