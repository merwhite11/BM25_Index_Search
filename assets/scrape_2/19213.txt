Are the "extinct species" of meteorites originally from the "Barbarian" asteroids?

I've asked earlierin this unanswered question about an "extinct species" of meteorite, now I've just read in Phys.org about Barbarian asteroids:

Named after the first asteroid of this type discovered, Barbara (234), Barbarians are a key to understanding how the solar system first formed. Barbarians are extremely rare and ancient, and were present before the Earth was created. Only 13 Barbarians have ever been discovered.

Are these two different types of extremely rare materials, or are the "extinct" meteorites actually products of the "rare Barbarian" asteroids?
