Is the ratio $L_B / L_{H\alpha}$ important to determine star formation rates?

Could someone please tell me if the ratio $$\frac{L_B}{L_{H\alpha}}$$
is important in determining star formation rates?
Additionally, could someone please explain the implication of the ratio to me or direct me to a source?
