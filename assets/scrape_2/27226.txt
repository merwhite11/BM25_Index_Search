Would an extremely bright star produce same kind of shadow band effect as seen in solar eclipses just before totality?

This answer explains that the shimmering patterns seen on surfaces at the moment before totality of a solar eclipse are called shadow bands, and that the phenomenon is closely related to the twinkling appearance of stars (but not angularly larger planets) through the Earth's atmosphere.
If for some reason there happened to be a bright star close enough to Earth that its nighttime illumination visible on surfaces, but small enough in angular width that it twinkled, would we see shadow bands at night, every night when the star was out?
As there's a good chance the answer is "yes" to the hypothetical, I'd like to ask if this situation is in fact possible, or if a star were close enough to be bright enough to visibly illuminate a white surface at night, would it then be large enough in angular extent that it wouldn't twinkle any more?
