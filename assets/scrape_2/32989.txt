Why do transits of Earth across the Sun seen from Mars follow a pattern of occurring after 26, 79 then 100 years?

According to this answer transits of Earth across the disk of the Sun as seen from Mars:

The (Arthur C.) Clarke story is quite correct. Earth (and Moon) would transit the sun from the viewpoint of Mars on 8 May 1905, 11 May 1984 and again on 10 Nov 2084.

no surprises there, but they

...follow a pattern of occurring after 26, 79 then 100 years.

Why is that exactly? Why this pattern?
