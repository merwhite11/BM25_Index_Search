What could be past the particle horizon?

Forgive any kind of "dumb" question I may ask as this is a new interest of mine and I know it's purely hypothetical. 
If one were able to surpass light speed and the expansion of space to go beyond the particle horizon, what could be out there? Could it just be an empty void? Could it loop around to the other side of the particle horizon? I'd love to read about any kind of theories or research done on this subject.
