Has the rotation of Eris and Dysnomia been observed?

Since both Eris and Dysnomia have been captured on a single image, is it possible to shoot multiple images of them to see how they rotate around each other? Has this been attempted? We don't know much about Dysnomia, but observing its revolution around Eris could shed some light on its characteristics. Eris-Dysnomia is believed to have the 2nd-highest mass ratio, after Pluto-Charon.
