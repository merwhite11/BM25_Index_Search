Are the 2 planets in this image Venus and Saturn? And is this a fireball shooting star in top right of picture?

I took this picture with my iPhone on January 23, 2023 @6:01pm CST. I am in West Central Alabama very close to the Tenn-Tom Waterway a few miles from the MS state line. I was facing west-southwest.
I believe that I saw the terminus of the fireball shooting star but it seemed more like a flash instead of an explosion so I’m just not sure about what it was. Also, there were no meteor showers active in this area at this time so I was wondering if a fireball is the same thing as a shooting star?




This is link to video. However the object doesn’t show up on YouTube so I guess there is quality loss in uploading it. This is a screenshot from the video. I circled the object. It shows up in the video at 1 second and the flash happens right before 3 seconds. Hope this helps.
This is a screenshot of file properties, maybe that will offer additional information.
