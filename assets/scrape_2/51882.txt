What caused a huge piece of the Sun to break off?

There seems to be a huge piece of the sun that broke off at approximately 53 degrees. There's at least one article that describes it in these terms.
This, to me, seems to be a CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) â€“ it seems that it cannot be a solar flare because it is just a burst of EM radiation. However before this event, there is a high chance that a solar flare happened.
Coincidentally, now the Sun's 11-year solar cycle has completed and during a solar maximum, we see a lot of sunspots.
So my theory is that this is because we have reached the solar maximum, thus magnetic field lines entangle easily, thus this event happened. Is this correct?
