What is this "Table of astronomy" about?

I found this picture while looking for some tattoo ideas and would like to know what these sketches are supposed to mean.   
Im especially interested in figures 1, 21, 53 and 56.  
It appears to be a scan of page 164 of the Cyclop√¶dia (an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences), from 1728. Higher Resolution
