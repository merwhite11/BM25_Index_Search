"Quarter root of intensity" in coronographic plots

In excitement regarding the JWST release, I came across Krist et al, The JWST/NIRCam coronagraph: mask design and fabrication, within which there is the following plot:


Fig. 9. Focal plane images from the IRCT in K band (λ = 2.2
µm), displayed as the quarter-root of intensity. (Left)
Image with a circular Lyot stop in place but no occulter.
(Right) Image with the 2.2 µm dot pattern mask and
Lyot stop in place, multiplied by 10000 in intensity to
compare with the image on the left. The speckles are due
to aberrations in the testbed.

I'm curious if there is a physical rationale for why a quarter-root scaling would have been chosen? This paper is the only search result for "quarter root of intensity", so was it simply an arbitrary decision to draw the eye, or does it have some basis in astronomy?
