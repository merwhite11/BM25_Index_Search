Camera reaching the event horizon

This question came to my mind after reading this.
I think it is safe to assume that the supposedly thrown camera would not reach the event horizon in one piece. So my question is : 
If I dropped a TV camera into a black hole, will it be destroyed before it reaches the event horizon, and if so, why?
