Where is the flaw in this hypothetical concept of escaping event horizon using another's blackhole flyby?

imagine two black holes approaching each other in a way that they will perform just very close flyby. You have a spaceship just below the event horizon of one black hole in line between centers of both black holes all the time.
When the black holes are closest to each other you should find yourself outside of the event horizon for a moment as the influence of one black hole should cancel out some part of the influence of the another black hole ( in similar fashion as the influences cancel out in the exact middle of a planet ); therefore, enabling you to escape. However, current physics says that nothing can leave the event horizon. Where is the flaw in this scenario?
