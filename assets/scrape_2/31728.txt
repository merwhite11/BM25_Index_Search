Is it possible for redshift to be caused by light being somehow slowed down during travel?

In other words, is the assumption, that redshift is caused by universe expansion, definitive? Or are other theories still being considered? Could it be, that light is being slowed down by dark energy, dark matter, massive objects, etc., as it travels through space?
