Does all of time exist and if so where is it?

I've recently learned about the theory of relativity and time.  I'm trying to understand it more.  
My (basic) understanding is that there is no distinction between past present and future and that all of time already exists.
If this is true, what prevents us from seeing the past and the future? And/Or what causes us to only be able to see the "present"?
