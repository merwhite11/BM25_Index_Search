Can earth escape sun's gravity with the help of a black hole heading towards our solar system?

To escape the Sun's gravity, the Earth would need sufficient amount of energy. Let's say a stellar black hole has entered our solar system and at a certain distance from earth, the black hole exerts same and equal gravitational force on the Earth as the sun is exerting. Earth feels a zero net force. Will it help earth to fly away?
Assuming the black hole had an empty stomach before eating our solar system.
