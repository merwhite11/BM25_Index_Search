What is the maximum Clear Sky Light Pollution rating to see the 2018 Perseid Meteor Shower?

I'm talking about the Light Pollution ratings on this page: http://www.cleardarksky.com/csk/faq/2.html
I live in an area which is a 7 on the Bortle Scale ("red" on clearsky.com), but within 2 hours of an area with a rating of 3. I am trying to determine how far I need to drive in order to get a proper viewing.
What is the maximum rating that will enable me to view the Perseid Meteor Shower tonight (2018)?
