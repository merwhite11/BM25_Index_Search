What is the science behind the polar light shapes

Is there any scientific explanation that causes polar lights (aurora borealis/australis) to have their unique shapes?
Specifically:

Rayed Arcs
Dual Bands
Corona

This site (by NASA) proposes:

The different shapes of auroras are a mystery that scientists are still trying to 
  unravel. The shape seems to depend on where in the magnetosphere the electrons 
  originate, what causes them to gain their energy, and why they dive into the 
  atmosphere.

(Subsection: Why do auroras come in different colors and shapes?)
I am specifically asking if there are any scientific observations (formulas or even simulations) that could describe such patterns (or even similar observations from fluid or gas dynamics). Furthermore, if it forms a rippled ring for instance, there should be a wave-like function, right?
Afterall, they could also be in a straight line..
