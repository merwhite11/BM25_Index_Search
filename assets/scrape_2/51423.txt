How is it possible to have black holes in the sub-atomic scale?

I've heard of black holes forming in particle accelerators. This was a huge topic of discussion back in the early '00 with the grand experiment in CERN to prove the Higgs boson. Many people started expressing concerns about the formation of black holes. Of course scientists weren't concerned due to their very short existence.
But how can a black hole form from just some particle colliding with each other ?
As far as I know in order for a black hole to form a threshold of concentrated mass has to be exceeded.
