What is the smallest possible planet with same sea level atmospheric pressure as Earth?

Suppose there is a planet made of pure tungsten (a quite common and heavy element), with perfect spherical shape.
Which should be its radius so that the air pressure and ground/sea level is the same as on earth ?
I don't know if it is sufficient to have a 1G gravity, because the smaller radius could affect the density of the atmosphere as the gravity will decrease differently that from earth.
For sake of simplificy, say that this planet is on the same orbit as Earth, orbiting around a twin of our Sun. Also magnetic field and atmosphere composition should be comparable to the Earth's one (altough this is not realistic, due to the lack of body of waters).
