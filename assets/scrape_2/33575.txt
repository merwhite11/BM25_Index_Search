How (the heck) does Astrometry.net work?

What magic is this? 
This answer to my question Astronomy detective question: what part of the sky are these photos of? What are a few of the stars? nails it, and the output (linked there) contains the following images along with a whole lot more information.
The images are analyzed by astrometry.net
How does it do what it does? If I understand correctly you can upload random star images with a wide variety of fields of view (from telescopes to cell phones) and random orientations and no further information, and it figures it out.
Is there a way to explain how the algorithm works with more detail than "a computer matches the dots to known stars"?
