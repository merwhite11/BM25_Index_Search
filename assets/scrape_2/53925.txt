Could You Escape an Event Horizon by increasing a Black Hole's velocity?

I have an idea for trying to escape the black hole's event horizon that might make basically no sense and I want it double checked. Basically, I do know that you can't escape the event horizon unless you can move faster than light, but there is no way to move faster than light... But what if you fake it?
The basic idea is that, if you move the black hole in one direction and turn your ships thrusters on in the opposite, you could get to the point where the ship is moving away from the center of the black hole at faster than light speeds even though both objects are moving at FTL speeds. Basically, you are in a zone where you need to move at 1.01C to escape, you turn your ship on to move at 0.6C and you somehow (probably with outside help) get the black hole's center to move at exactly .41C in the exact opposite direction allowing you to escape. This seems like a relatively simple method that would theoretically allow a particle or a tiny fraction of mass or light to escape a black hole... but it seems so obvious that if it actually worked it would be common knowledge already... So why doesn't this work?
