How to calculate exact angle to the moon?

I am building some device as a gift for my girlfriend.
For this device to work, I need to be able to calculate the angle to which I should look towards (3D angle), in order to see the moon.
This angle is affected by (and maybe not only):

The time of year.
The hour.
The location on earth from which I look.

I'm sure there's some formula that approximates the angle.
I don't need an exact value, I can live with +-1 degree.
