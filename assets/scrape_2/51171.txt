Can the Hubble expansion inject energy in AGN and quasar outflows?

I found this article about the behavior of quasar outflows in cosmology and how they can create a magnetic field.
In section 2.1.4., the authors say that when a quasar produces a "wave" or an outflow, the material will be emitted with energy coming from both the quasar itself and the Hubble flow of the expansion of the Universe itself.
Does this really mean that the expansion of the universe can inject energy into these outflows? Are there any other papers acknowledging this?
Then, is energy conserved in this case? Wouldn't the Hubble expansion be adding "new" energy to the system according to the article?
