the length of second, minute or hour, what defines the time of exo planetary bodies

we measure time based on earth and earth mass\gravity plays a role in the measurement ? so how and what would be time if not earth time on other exo planets since they will be having different mass/gravity and probably more variables affecting time measurement.
I can say Gliesa has a day of 30 hrs(assumed) , 
So will the length of second, minute and hour, likeewise day or month will fall under its own time system?
