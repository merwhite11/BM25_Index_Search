Why Nyquist Sampling Rate depends on Bandwidth and not max frequency?

Is the Nyquist sampling rate same for different bands if those bands have same bandwith? E.g. Would the Nyquist Sampling rate be same for 1000-1400 MHz band as for 100-500 MHz band because both the bands have same bandwidth (400 MHz)? This doesn't make logical sense to me as I guess Nyquist sampling rate should depend on the max frequency that we are measuring. E.g. I think sampling rate/frequency for 1000-1400 MHz band should be 2800 MHz.
Can someone please help me understand this?
