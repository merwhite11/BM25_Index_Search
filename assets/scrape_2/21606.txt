Was the Crab Nebula to the southeast of Zeta Tauri 1,000 years ago?

I've been reading about SN 1054 and how most professional investigators believe that it is the Crab Nebula today. But the wiki article has this to say:

The location of the guest star as "to the south-east of Tianguan, perhaps several inches away" has perplexed modern astronomers, because the Crab Nebula is not situated in the south-east, but to the north-west of Zeta Tauri.

Well, then I remembered the precession of the equinoxes. I know precession does not change the fixed background of stars, but can change their relative location.
If we rewind the precession 1000 years, does Zeta Tauri cross the zero meridian or the celestial equator?
