When and where are we exposed to most cosmic radiation?

I understand the mechanical dynamics of being faced away from the Sun at night, having a lower altitude, not being in the weak points at the poles in the atmosphere, being in a valley and others decreasing cosmic radiation.
Are the particular areas on Earth where cosmic radiation is amplified or unprotected by the magnetosphere because of the  lensing effect on cosmic rays either by location or angle of the sun?
