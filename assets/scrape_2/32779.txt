Which things can LIGO see that LISA can't, and vice-versa?

CNET's Astronomers discover two ferociously fast stars locked in a death spiral quotes Kevin Burdge, lead author on the new paper in Nature  General relativistic orbital decay in a seven-minute-orbital-period eclipsing binary system (no ArXiv?) and a Ph.D. candidate in physics at Caltech as saying:

LIGO can see things that LISA can't, and LISA can see some things that LIGO can't, and there are a handful of things that might switch from being visible in LISA to LIGO over time"

Is there a simple way to understand which "things" fall into which categories?
LIGO is a ground-based gravitational wave observatory and is used together with Virgo, whereas LISA stands for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and will be a GW sensing inteferometer based on a trio of satellites in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit.
