Is there a distinction between NEOs and near-Earth asteroids? Is there a difference?

My "real question" is in Space Exploration Meta (neo (near-earth-object) and near-earth-asteroid tags, do we need both?), but I think that astronomers will be able to help understand the situation and terminology.
Question: Is there a distinction between NEOs and near-Earth asteroids? Is there a difference? Or is it a distinction without a difference?
I noticed for example that here in Astronomy SE there is just near-earth-object.
