How ready are we to deal with a asteroid/comet/giant-meteor on a collision course with Earth?

I keep hearing astronomers saying there are observatories scanning the skies all day and night looking for near-Earth objects, extrapolating their trajectories. 
My questions are

If we were to get the news of an on-coming object, how early we will find out or how much time we will have?

Currently, people don't even think about it; Governments are cutting spending in their space exploration programs, let alone deflecting an impact-er.
Under certain circumstances, would the notice from the watchdogs be enough for us to build something that would prevent the loss?
