How fast would we have to go for the red(/blue)shifts of galaxies ahead of us to differ from those behind us with statistical significance?

Here, we are looking for a statistically significant difference between the mean redshifts of galaxies ahead and those behind, with reference to a prior-specified direction. For example, suppose that we were aboard an advanced spaceship that had been accelerating in that direction at (say) 1 $g$ for some years. How soon into our journey would we notice that the galaxies ahead were bluer than the galaxies behind? Clearly this depends on our existing model, based on prior observations, for the distribution of galaxies' redshifts, and on some reasonable kind of weighting for each individual galaxy (perhaps according to the cosine of angle from our direction of travel, but not according to the galaxy's distance). However, in this analysis, we are ignoring individual data about any particular galaxy acquired before our present observation. For simplicity, let us also suppose that there is no statistically significant difference between the mean redshifts forward and back in the line of our journey before we began it. For the sake of definiteness, if it is needed, let us take a significance level of 1%.
