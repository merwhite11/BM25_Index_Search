the most accurate system that can show the positions of planets at my birthday

My birthday : 4 December 1982
If you have such astronomical calculator on your computer please send me the result !
Alternatively if you know an online astronomical service for my purpose please link it here ?
I am so curious to discover geometrical proportions between distance and angle of planets at that date ...
