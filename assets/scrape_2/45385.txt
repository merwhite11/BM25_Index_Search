What are typical peculiar velocities?

I'm wondering what sorts actual values we can expect to find for peculiar velocities of individual objects when observing the universe, both typically and on the high end.  I'm interested in any reasonable definition of peculiar velocity â€” though I'm generally thinking about it relative to the Hubble flow.
I've seen numbers around a few hundred km/s for things like the motion of the solar system relative to the local group or the CMB, or the local group relative to the great attractor.  I've also found galactic rotation curves upwards of a few hundred km/s.  And the measurement of the sun's motion relative to the local standard of rest has individual stars around the same order of magnitude.  So I'm gonna say bog-standard peculiar velocities may get up to about 1,000 km/s.  Is that reasonable?  Is there a common class of objects that will typically have higher velocities?
Now, at the high end, I would expect that the very highest velocities involve close approaches to black holes.  Are there other mechanisms that might push objects to higher speeds reasonably often?  I see that one star (S62) orbiting Sgr A* reaches about 30,000 km/s on closest approach.  Is this the highest speed ever measured in the universe?
