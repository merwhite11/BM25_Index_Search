Do red dwarf stars get dimmer over time, the opposite of most other main sequence stars?

It is common knowledge, for instance, that the sun has increased in brightness by roughly 40% since its formation... (The apparently early appearance of life has led to the 'Faint young Sun paradox', e.g...)
Everything I have read (book, textbook, article, etc.) says that main sequence stars generally get brighter (and larger) over their lifetimes (not sure about increased temperature....)
However, I recently came across articles about the discovery that TRAPPIST-1's planet called TRAPPIST-1b does not seem to have an atmosphere, and that this may be due to red dwarf stars' being brighter, NOT dimmer, very early in their lifetimes....
Is this true?  Do red dwarfs age like Benjamin Button, in reverse, so to speak, in comparison to all other stars?
