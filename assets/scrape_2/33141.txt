Why don't we see evidence of glaciation on Mars, similar to Earth's Ice Ages?

With all recent NASA activity surrounding Mars manned missions, it is surprising that given Mars orbital distance from Sun that there is not evidence of massive glaciation similar to Earth's Ice Ages. Also Mars allegedly has erratic Obliquity anything from 11 - 28 degree swings which would obviously affect seasonal changes. Is this a fact (where's the evidence) or "scientific fable".

Interesting replies - due to implications of erratic obliquity, hopefully NASA have a probe recording changes.
