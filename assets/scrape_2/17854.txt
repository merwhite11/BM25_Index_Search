Do some ELF (Extremely low frequency) radio waves pass the atmosphere

...reach Earth surface and then are reflected passing the atmosphere again to reach outer space? And once in outer space can they travel indefinetely in it or the interplabetary plasma would stop them? This occurs only when when the plasma is excited? When it is not, these radio waves would be able to make it through?
