Filters for solar eclipse and solar feature viewing

I have 

a Vixen ED100SF ED refracting telescope and 
10x50 6.5 Bushnell Legend Porro Prism binoculars

and would like to outfit both with filters for solar eclipse viewing. I gather the basic setup simply involves finding an appropriate filter, that fits the equipment, but I'm new to this and the range of options is bewildering. Ideally I'd also like something that allows me to see solar features, but I gather that these can be quite expensive.
What are my options (or a good reference on options) for viewing solar eclipses and solar features? Would something like an "eyepiece" filter work on its own for safe viewing, or would my telescope require something different?
