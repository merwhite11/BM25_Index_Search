Are there ideas about Multiverse in cosmology that are independent of string theory?

It is known that string theory allows for many kinds of universes within it's Landscape which give rise to the concept of the multiverse. But are the concepts/ideas about multiverse in cosmology which have nothing to do with string theory and still allows for many kinds of universes, each with different set of physical constants and properties?
