Path of sun in the sky on a planet with no axial tilt

Some sources online (e.g. this, see section "Effect of Earthâ€™s Eccentricity") claim that if the earth's axis was not tilted, then the analemma would have the shape of an ellipse/oval. I think if there was no tilt then the midday analemma would simply be a line along the celestial equator from any latitude (i.e. sun would have has constant elevation at midday throughout the year). And if the analemma was not taken at midday, then its shape would be close to a line with constant celestial latitude: there would be some small variation in solar elevation due to the true solar time differing from the mean solar time (the analemma is taken at the same mean solar time every day). Am I missing something or are those sources simply inaccurate?
