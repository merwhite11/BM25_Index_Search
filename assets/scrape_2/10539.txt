Concerning fate of Milky Way Galaxy

Andromeda Galaxy is the largest galaxy in the galaxy cluster[1] called Local Group[2] and our Milky Way Galaxy as well as some satellite/dwarf galaxies are orbiting around each other within Local Group. My question isn't Milky Way Galaxy supposed to orbit around Andromeda Galaxy[3] so how come the predicted merger[4]? Whose slowing down or do the gravity work differently as things are being scaled further up?
