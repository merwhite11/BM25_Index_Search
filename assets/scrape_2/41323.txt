Calculating the time a star is at my local meridian based on its right ascension

I've been watching an astronomy course on YouTube and I'm struggling to calculate stars' positions based on their right ascension.
What I'm trying to achieve: Calculate when a star (Sirius in this example) will be exactly on my local meridian.
What I know: The star's right ascension and the "noon" time (=when the sun will be exactly on my local meridian).
Let's assume we are on March 21st: According to https://stellarium-web.org/ The sun will be on my meridian at 12:10. Sirius's right ascension is 6h46m, which means Sirius should be at the meridian 6h46m later which is 18:56. According to Stellarium Sirius will indeed be at the meridian at 18:52 (I suppose that 4 minute difference is because the sun is already 4 minute behind due to Earth rotation).
But when I try to do the same calculation for today (Feb 10th) I get a 20 minute error.
The "noon" on Feb 10th where I live is at 12:18. We add Sirius' right ascension to get 19:04. But this time we also have to take into account the fact that we are 41 days away from March 21st. Each day the sun falls behind by ~4 minutes, so that's 2h44m. If we add that to 19:04 we get 21:48. So that's the time Sirius should be at my local meridian on this particular day. But Stellarium shows that Sirius will actually be at the meridian at 21:26. So there's 22 minutes error in my calculations for some reason.
I think the root of the error is the 2h44m that I calculated for the sun's position. According to Stellarium the sun's right ascension on that day is 21h38m. Meaning it is 2h22m behind not 2h44m. And that's why I get that 22 minutes error. But I don't understand how it can be 2h22m because Feb/10 is 41 days away from March/21. That means 41x4 = 164 minutes = 2h44m.
What am I missing here?
