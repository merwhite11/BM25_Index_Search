How can I calculate when the new moon will be observed from a particular meridian?

I have read that Chinese months start on the day on which the new moon is observed from the 120th meridian east.  From this I am assuming that the new moon is observable from there each time and that it doesn't matter where on the meridian you are (although I suppose it's implied you're in the northern hemisphere).
How can I calculate the time at which the moon is new from a particular meridian?
