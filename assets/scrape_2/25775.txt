Bright pulsating light

Was looking at the sky and I see a satellite , turned around and saw another light , but this light was pulsating like a strobe light , definitely not a plane , next thing I know the light goes out and was not seen again , could this be a dying star , I know what satellites and planes look like in the sky , but I have never seen anything like this , it just went dark after being super bright
