How did "oddball" Valetudo, Jupiter's new prograde moon, end up in a wider orbit?

I just saw this question and that got me to this NASA page which led me to this scientific article.


“Our other discovery is a real oddball and has an orbit like no other known Jovian moon,” Sheppard explained. “It’s also likely Jupiter’s smallest known moon, being less than one kilometer in diameter”.
This new “oddball” moon is more distant and more inclined than the prograde group of moons and takes about one and a half years to orbit Jupiter.  So, unlike the closer-in prograde group of moons, this new oddball prograde moon has an orbit that crosses the outer retrograde moons.
As a result, head-on collisions are much more likely to occur between the “oddball” prograde and the retrograde moons, which are moving in opposite directions.
“This is an unstable situation,” said Sheppard. “Head-on collisions would quickly break apart and grind the objects down to dust.”


My question is, why are most of the moons that are further away from Jupiter retrograde orbits, while the ones extremely close to Jupiter are prograde orbits? What possible situations were required for Valetudo to end up where it is opposed to where the rest of the pro-grade moons are clustered? Pure chance / a series of unlikely events?
