Brightest most colorful star in eastern morning sky not near any constellations; rises about 4 or 5 am?

I have been believing this is Saturn, but perhaps Antares instead? It is so colorful it shines blue, red, green and white. 
It is largest in sky in the East before dawn rises about 4 or 5 AM, seen from the San Joaquin valley, central California.
