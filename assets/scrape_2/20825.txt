How strong is the gravitational stretch we experience from the edge of the universe?

How much gravitational effect do we experience (e.g. maybe -.00001 G or smaller) from the edge of the visible universe?  By edge of the visible universe, I am talking about the region of the cosmic microwave background and beyond.  In the past, the universe was very hot and dense, and we are seeing the light from this time period as the Cosmic Microwave Background.  It took slightly less than the age of the universe for that light to reach us, and it has become extremely redshifted with the expansion of space.  Since gravity apparently travels at the speed of light, we should be experiencing a gravitational effect from this shell around us as well.  As I understand, the universe was extremely dense back then, and it is around us in every direction, which would intensify the gravity greatly.  However, it is extremely distant, which would weaken the gravity greatly.  I don't know if redshift would affect gravity as it has the light from the cosmic microwave background, but if so, this would weaken the effect greatly as well.  With all this in mind, I am curious, what would be the effect of gravity from the edge of the universe on us?
Note: I would expect this to be a very small outward effect in all directions, something like -.00000001 g or something like that, but not 0.
