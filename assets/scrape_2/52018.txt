Other Hubble spheres with no Lorentz symmetry?

Perhaps this may be a stupid question but anyways here it goes...
If the Lorentz symmetry is not global but rather local, wouldn't that mean that is possible that other Hubble spheres outside our observable universe could have other symmetries or an absence of the Lorentz symmetry? I mean, does this mean that the Lorentz symmetry could hold in our local region of spacetime (that is, our observable universe) but, as it does not hold globally, there could be other regions where it would not hold?
