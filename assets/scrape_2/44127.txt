Why is the 11 yr sunspot cycle less predictable recently?

I quoted from a similar question on solar minima and maxima. "...I guess the jury is still out, but this is quite "fringe" material. The solar cycle is certainly thought to be a product of the dynamo mechanism that produces the magnetic field." So has something changed in the dynamo mechanism?
