Tracking deep sky objects

I have a Celestron Astromaster 130Eq. I saw all the planets in our solar system and quite satisfied. Now I am in the hunt for DSOs, but living in a city is a disaster for tracking some good-for-observation deep sky objects. At the moment, I have only observed the Orion nebula (which was elegant) and nothing else. Any tips for how to track them?
