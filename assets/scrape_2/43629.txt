What do falsifiability and verifiability actually mean as a precondition of a scientific hypothesis?
I have been hearing from science guys that unlike philosophical hypothesis or theory, to be a scientific hypothesis an educated guess must have to be falsifiable and verifiable. But I cannot comprehend falsifiable and verifiable conditions for some scientific hypotheses especially in astronomy field. For example,
Couple of scientific hypotheses exists about the shape of the universe,


Universe is positively curved
Universe is negatively curved
Universe is flat


These are the well known scientific hypotheses as far as my knowledge (correct me if I am wrong). It seems to me, though I may be wrong, none of the above hypotheses are anyway falsifiable and verifiable because it is never possible for us to measure the geometry as the universe is expanding beyond our scope of study. For example, we can may be able to test on larger amount space as time goes on and technology advances, but to measure the actual shape of the whole universe we need to know theoretically the full picture of the universe which is not possible for us according to current understandings of science.
Now, there might be many such hypotheses which we cannot take under testable and verifiable condition yet we call them scientific hypothesis. My question is,

Is a scientific hypothesis really required to be falsifiable and verifiable? If so, what are the falsifiable and verifiable conditions for above mentioned hypotheses?
