Do solstices and equinoxes shift over time?

Right now, I think the winter solstice is around December 21. Has it always been around this date constantly?
Since the earth's axis's 23.45Â° tilt will be on the exact opposite side in 13000 years (or was 13000 years ago) due to precession, it'd seem like the seasons would flip every 13000 years. So, +/- 13000 years from now, it would've turned summer around December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere, right?
