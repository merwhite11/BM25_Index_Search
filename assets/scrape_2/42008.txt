Looking for methods to preserve night vision

Does anyone have a method to preserve night vision so that a car or other passing light source does not ruin it?
I have a dark location to observe the sky; however, it is near a rarely used dirt road.  I can hear a car coming in time to protect my night vision, but have been unable to find a method so that its light does not ruin my light vision.   I have tried putting a 5-gallon metal bucket over my head, covering my eyes with a towel, etc.   My night vision still gets ruined.
I want to be able to totally block all light from my eyes until the car/light-source passes.
