How can I estimate how long will a main sequence star stay on the main sequence given its temperature?

I have a generic zero-age main sequence star. The only thing I know about it is its temperature. How can I estimate time time it spends on the main sequence (in millions of years)? I've seen equations that estimate it based on mass, like $L=M^{-2.5}\cdot10^{10}$, but I do not have the mass, only the temperature. Is there any definite formula (accurate to a reasonable degree) for this?
