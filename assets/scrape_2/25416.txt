Why do Uranus and Neptune have more methane than Jupiter and Saturn?

So the standard theory of the solar nebula is that in the region of the gas planets, ice and rock could condense to form planetesimals, which could then accrete hydrogen and helium to form the gas giants. The giant planets are all mostly hydrogen and helium, but Uranus and Neptune have relatively large amounts of hydrogen compounds like methane (that's what gives them their color).
My question is: why did that happen? How did Uranus and Neptune get their methane? My impression is that all the gas giants were far enough out for methane to condense into ice, so how did Uranus and Neptune end up preferentially with methane?
