Would impacting plasma clouds destroy electronics on Earth or make them only temporarily inactive?

We read that solar flares have increased again recently. At the same time, it is always reported that the plasma clouds hitting the Earth would, under certain conditions, disable all electronics on Earth.
I wonder if this means that the electronics will be destroyed or only temporarily inactive?
