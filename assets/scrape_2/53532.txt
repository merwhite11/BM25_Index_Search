How can we estimate distance of galaxies by only redshift when there are other several factors other than distance to cause redshift

There are different factors for red appearance of different objects in the night sky. Two reasons which I know are

Star red by nature
Example: red supergiants
They emit red light because of their surface temperature.
Object moving further away from us
Let's assume there is a galaxy which is close to us but still moving away from us very fast so even it appears red.

So do we depend on only the red appearance of galaxies to find distance?
