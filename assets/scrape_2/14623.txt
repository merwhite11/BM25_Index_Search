Equation for solar radiation at a given latitude on a given exoplanet?

I'm trying to find equations that would help me determine the amount of solar radiation hitting a certain latitude on a certain planet given the following inputs:

the degrees of latitude of the location in question
this hemisphere's current season (winter or summer)
size of the planet
luminosity of the star(s) the planet orbits

Without taking into consideration wind, air pressure, or any atmospheric effects.
Ideally I would like to determine the average solar radiation of a given location in both the winter and summer. 
My end goal is to determine the average surface temperature of a given latitude on a planet using the base solar radiation and the effects of wind, air pressure, and surface ocean currents.
I know it is possible to do this for the entire planet generally, but I would like some way of doing it for a particular latitude and season.
