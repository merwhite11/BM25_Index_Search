Mass loss rate in a typical visible-from-Earth comet

What is the typical range of a comet's mass loss per second to its dust and gas tails, while it is naked-eye visible from Earth?
I'm aware this is going to be a very broad range and expect it to cover multiple orders of magnitude, so any specific examples — Hale–Bopp, Halley's, or similar, at any point where their apparent magnitude was enough to be visible without a telescope — would be perfectly valid answers, even though I'm mainly curious about the minimum.
