Does the Milky Way belong to a Galaxy cluster

I know that the Milky Way is a member of the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster / Laniakea Supercluster. However, I can't seem to find any information about the Galaxy cluster we belong to.
Does the Local Group / Milky Way belong to a galaxy cluster?
