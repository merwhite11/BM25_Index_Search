What is the thickness of black holes event horizon?

I would premit that I am just an enthusiast, so don't expect a good background or a deep mathematical knowledge about the topic.
I just read an article about how light is reflected by a black hole (https://www.sciencealert.com/we-now-have-precise-maths-to-describe-how-black-holes-reflect-the-universe/amp). That let me think because, as far as I can understand that imply that the geometrical place where gravitational pull is "just strong enough" to "capture" light has to be a sphere (or geoid if the black hole rotate). What is hard to grasp for me is how perfect that sphere should be in reality (mathematical place doesn't not exist in real world).In other words I am asking if that topic was studied and which is the trending hipotesys about real thickness and smoothness of event horizon (intended as the region of space in which gravitational pull is just strong enough to capture the light, but not too strong).
