Strange speck of light in the picture sequence of the approach to 2014 Mu69 (Ultima Thule)

In the picture sequence which was taken by New Horizons during the approach to Ultima Thule on the 3rd of Dec there can be seen a speck of light in the lower left corner, not as bright as 2014 MU69 but clearly visible.

Is there any theory what may have caused this signal? A particle from the probe itself, coincidentally passing in front of the lens? A variable star? A small object in the right distance and angle to be glimpsed upon by New Horizons? I think the latter would be an astronomically improbable event...
Here are some single frames of that image sequence, the speck is clearly visible on the 3rd of December.
