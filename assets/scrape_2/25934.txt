What if a Black Hole passed through an Irregular type galaxy?

So, most of you all are probably (well, why wouldn't you be) familiar with The Magellanic Clouds, and hour they are Irregular type galaxies. You should also be aware that they both orbit the Milky Way, so they act sort of like moons to a planet. Since they (most likely) do not have a central Supermassive Black Hole, I wonder, out of all ridiculousness, what are the answer to these two questions?:
1) What would happen to the Small or Large Magellanic Clouds if a Black Hole (maybe 100 time bigger than the sun) passed though them?
2) What would happen if Sagittarius A* passed through either the Small or Large Magellanic clouds. If you are not aware of Sagittarius A*, it is the Supermassive Black Hole that lies at the center of the Milky Way.
