Computing the rate of orbital decay

We know that the estimated time until a binary system merges is given by: $$\dfrac{5c^5r^4}{256G^3(m_1m_2)(m_1+m_2)}$$ But what is the formula to determine rate of decay, in some sort of distance unit, per unit of time? Also, what are terms are $r$ and $m_i$ written in?
