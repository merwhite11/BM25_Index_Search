Is there a limit to the Schwarzschild radius?

The Schwarzschild radius is a way for us to calculate the extent to which something has to be shrunk in order for it to become a black hole but I was wondering is there a limit to the object that we shrink? Would it be possible for me to shrink a neutrino to some size that makes it into a black hole?
