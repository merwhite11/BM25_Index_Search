Why doesn't the Earth's rotation throw us off the surface?

The Earth is spinning at about a thousand miles per hour. Shouldn't we be thrown from its surface? 
Yes I know someone would comment "gravity" but physically we should be thrown from Earths surface. Scientists say that gravity is holding us here but that seems to contradict physics. Maybe someone can better explain it to me.
