Can you see the shadow of a spaceship on the Moon while looking towards the Earth?

It's a classic movie cliche. We see the surface of the Moon with the Earth in the distance and a dark shadow of an invading alien spaceship slowly covering the landscape.
We see this in the opening sequence of the 1996 movie Independence Day, and I can think of a few other movies which have done this effect.
What's really important is that the spaceship moves into visible frame as it passes overhead. So it's not a shadow from another orbital position, and so that also means the Sun would be directly overhead of the observer.
I've thought about where the Moon is in its orbit, where the Earth is in its orbit and where the Sun would be.
Is it possible for this to actually happen? If you were standing on the Moon, is there a time where the Earth is directly in front of you and the Sun is directly overhead. So that if something passed overtop of you the shadow would be directly on top of you?
