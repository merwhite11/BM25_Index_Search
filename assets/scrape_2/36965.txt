At what distance wouldn't the Sun cast a visible shadow anymore?

How far from the Sun would a (dwarf) planet have to be so that the Sun is dim enough that it doesn't cast a shadow when you're standing on the planet? What magnitude is the border in brightness beyond which a shadow isn't visible anymore?
