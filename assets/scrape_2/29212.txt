Why doesn't a singularity spin infinitely fast?

A question for a random reader passing through: because of the nature of things spinning faster when it gets smaller, wouldn't a singularity spin infinitely fast as it's infinitely small, if it has a spinn from the beginning that is? Btw I know what a "ringularity" but does it automaticly become one when rotational velocity is added? Is it just "fake news"?
