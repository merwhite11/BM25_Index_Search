What would happen if those gravitational waves were much stronger?

What if those gravitational waves detected would be actually so strong that the distance of those mirrors moved would be larger? Not 1/1000th of proton but rather one millimeter, or one meter or even more? What would happen to us? How big would these black holes had to be and how much energy would be released in such a process?
