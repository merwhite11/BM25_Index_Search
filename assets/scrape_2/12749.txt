Oldest in the universe

When the big bang happened and all that exist today came into existence from singularity, how do you determine which part of the universe is the oldest?  Its natural to think that looking back at the center of the universe, we would find the oldest galaxies(not sure if this is true); but isn't there a certain logic that the farthest from the center should have the oldest galaxies?  Is there a proven theory behind where we would find the oldest galaxies? or is this one of those space-time enigmas?
