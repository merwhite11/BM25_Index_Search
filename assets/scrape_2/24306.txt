If the Earth is rotating counter clockwise, how does the sun rise from east?

I was very confused when I watched this video from 2:18 till 2:45. And it seems very clear that if the Earth is really rotating from west to east, shouldn't be the Sun rising from west and setting in east? We all know certainly that the sun rises from east, but how come Earth is rotating in the way as shown in the linked video? 
PS: I somehow feel very stupid for asking this question...
