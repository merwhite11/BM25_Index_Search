Matter Temperature during Recombination

In several papers about Recombination, (for instance Peebles, Astrophysical Journal, vol. 153, eq. 39) it is claimed that the evolution of matter temperature follows the equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dt} = -2\frac{\dot{a}}{a}T + \frac{2}{3 K_B n} \epsilon
\end{equation}
where the first term in the right hand side accounts for the expansion of the universe and $\epsilon$ is the energy injected into the gas per second per unit physical volume. How can I derive this equation?
I suppose that this equation can be derived applying the First Principle of Thermodynamics to a comoving volume in the expanding universe or maybe taking the second moment of a Boltzmann equation. Any help or reference in which this equation is discussed would be very helpful.
