What are the Kinematics / Dynamics behind the motion?

The link I have attached is a predicted model for the eclipse in my area! I am very much confused about the movement of the moon analogous to the video in the link. Community, The movement seems like a parabola curve and no-doubt the model is telling it very well. In other ways, the motion also appears as bouncing of an object! I might have interpreted it in wrong sense or maybe not but that's no matter of concern ;-). A detailed answer would be a piece to take away from this question. Also, I suppose it to be a matter of Orbital Dynamics.
