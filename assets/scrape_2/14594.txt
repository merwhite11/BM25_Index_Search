What is the last nuclear reaction in a binary system before supernova?

I understand that binary star systems may cause type Ia supernovae.
I have a question regarding supernova explosion in a binary system. What is the last nuclear reaction before massive explosion?
I am thinking of two 2 close stars of 3M and 6M.
