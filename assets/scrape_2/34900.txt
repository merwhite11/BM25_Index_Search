Help identify a bright and round object photographed through a telescope

It was a brightest object in the sky. Attached is the picture taken on 25th January around 6pm in Riga / Latvia, towards the south direction:
Apologies for a quality of the picture, the telescope was inside the flat and the picture was taken through the window.

The object was visible for few hours while it was traveling from the south-east towards south-west. I observed this bright object previously on couple other days, it's the first time I pointed my tellescope in its direction.
