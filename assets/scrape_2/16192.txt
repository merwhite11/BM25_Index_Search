Milky Way mass fraction breakdown review

I'd like to know a breakdown of the mass of the Milky Way, by the major categories. So, something like
Stars       ... 3%
Cool nebula ... 7%
Gray matter ... 12%
Etc
Etc

This order-of-magnitude knowledge that everyone should know.
(Of course, when talking of the galaxy, we can, obviously, think of either just the visible disk-bulge, or perhaps, a greater unit of the galaxy sitting in a "bulb" (of - perhaps - dark matter (?), gas (?), dust (?), halo stars (?) or something else): a brief clear answer in a few sentences would expose these concepts.)
Surprisingly, this information is nowhere to be found in one place as an overview.
I appreciate that the largest chunk may be dark matter (is that right?); but I don't even have a ballpark idea for the rest. It's the sort of knowledge that is obvious to professionals, but surprisingly not outlined in any of the usual popular science sources.
