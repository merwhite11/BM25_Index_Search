Why is the Great Red Spot shrinking?

The Great Red Spot is an anticyclonic storm on Jupiter that is bigger than the Earth. Based on the Wikipedia article, it has been shrinking in size for the last 400 years, going from 41 to 16 thousand kilometers wide. What is causing this shrinking?
These articles from 2015 (1, 2) talk about the spot shrinkage, but are rather vague on the causes. Both of them mention that we would likely learn more with the Juno probe. Now that we have data from Juno, do we know more about why the Great Red Spot is changing in size?
