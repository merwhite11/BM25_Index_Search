Which star has a higher effective temperature, a red dwarf or a red giant?

According to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, they would roughly have the same temperature, but I've read in bibliography that the surface temperature of the red giant is about 5000K
and the one of the red dwarf can be down to 2000K. Which one would have the higher effective temperature?
In case they had the same. Would the color of a star define its effective temperature, regardless its size?
Many thanks!
