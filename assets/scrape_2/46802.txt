The Lambda-CDM-model: when will the Age of the universe catch up with the Hubble time?

Basic assumptions:
A) Within the Lambda-CDM-model we have two separate time measures:

the Age of the universe - today roughly 13.8 GY, and
the Hubble time - today roughly 14.4 GY

B) Very roughly, CDM came first, followed by Lambda

CDM ruled 0-9 GY A.B.B.
Lambda rules after 9 GY A.B.B.

C) According to theory:

During CDM a(t)=t^(2/3) => Hubble Time = 1.5 * the Age of the universe.
During Lambda the Hubble Time is constant, based on a(t) = exp(H*(t-t_now))

Questions, based on these very rough assumptions:

Currently the Hubble Time is still greater than the Age of the universe by some 600 MY, but Age is closing in. When will these two become equal?

Are there any reasonable estimates of the pure Lambda Hubble Time?

What will happen when Hubble Time equals Age of the universe?
