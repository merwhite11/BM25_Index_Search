Why doesn't the fusion process of the sun speed up?

Am I correct in saying that the fusion process of the sun is constant, i.e. X amount of fusion happens per day, more or less?
Why does this not speed up, i.e. one fusion event creates energy for two fusion events, etc.?
Does every collision of atom cause a fusion event, or is the probability small for a fusion event to happen thus it's not a runaway reaction?
I have heard that the probability for fusion event to happen is only 1 in 1012 for every collision.
