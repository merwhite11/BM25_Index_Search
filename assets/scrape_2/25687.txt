Do the number of moons a planet has affect the speed of the planet's rotation?

Would the tidal forces of multiple moons interacting upon a planet speed up or slow down the day length of the planet? I was thinking that maybe the planet's day length would be slowed down due to all of the gravitational tugging, but on the other hand I was thinking that maybe all of those tidal forces could perhaps slingshot the planet ahead and make it spin at a faster rate. Would the day length even change at all? If the answer is yes, could all of those moons even affect the planet's precession?
