Configuration required to tidally heat Earth-like rogue planet

Could it be possible for Earth-like rogue planet to maintain large bodies of liquid water on the surface without a sun by relying mostly on tidal forces of a moon (or multiple moons).
How big/far/fast would the moon have to be?
What about a binary planet instead of planet and a moon?
