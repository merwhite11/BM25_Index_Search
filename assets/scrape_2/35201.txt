Is it possible to affect Earth's orbit so that, say, aphelion happens sooner?

As part of its natural cycle, the sun is currently drifting away from the Earth, it's predicted to reach its farthest point by July 4th in 2020, at which point the distance between the Sun and Earth will start to close.
Do humans have enough power to control earth's orbit so that the sun starts its trip back sooner? I just can't wait for the heat to come back.
