Question about mars polar caps

I want to see Mars polar caps by myself. Is it feasible to make a picture of mars like this at home or to achive this very expensive telescope is required?
P.S. Maybe someone can give me a link, where it is shown how polar caps are changing during the seasons? Many pictures or animation.
