Which telescope to choose and some general questions

I'm playing with the idea to buy a telescope for years now and finally decided to do so. There are two which I consider: 
The Celestron NexStar 127 SLT Mak and the Celestron NexStar 130 SLT
I already know the difference between a Refractor and Maksutov-Cassegrain and for which observations they're suited for best (and also that the Mak doesn't need collimating).
First question: Which would be the better choice for a beginner and eventually astrophotography?
Second question: Is it possible to buy just the tube later (so I can reuse the motors and the tripod)?
Third question: As I've read, the tripod is pretty wobbly, so is it possible to replace the tripod later on (or is there a norm for the mounts)?
