How to calculate the distance of "3C 147"

According to Simbad ( http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=3C+147 ), the parallax is 0.0471 which would put it at a distance of 69,249 Light Years by using https://www.translatorscafe.com/unit-converter/en-us/calculator/parallax-distance/
This would put it inside or outside the Milky Way but Wikipedia puts it at 5.1 Billion which seems more correct.  Although the indirect page at Caltech says 5.2.
How can I calculate the distance of 3C 147 using the parallax from Simbad, by using another formula or its not possible as parallax at Simbad doesn't refer to distance.
