Is every star formed in an open star cluster?

As far as I understand, an open cluster is formed from a single molecular cloud, with each star in the cluster having roughly similar age and properties.
Our Sun is not part of any star cluster, but it could have been formed in one. Is every star formed in an open star cluster, or can they develop independently?
