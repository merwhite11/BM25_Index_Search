Recently, the most distant object in the solar system was discovered. How was this accomplished?

It was recently announced that the most distant object in our solar system was discovered. This object averages 132 AU from the sun. The object, initially named Farfarout, was estimated to be 400 km across. How was such a small object found and its orbit estimated by a ground-based telescope? This seems to really be pushing the limits of observable objects. Or am I wrong on this?
