Why are there not yet any instruments dedicated to registering time dilation caused by passing gravitational waves?

Why are there not yet any instruments dedicated to registering time dilation caused by passing gravitational waves?
Wouldn't it be interesting to augment LIGO/Virgo capturing of space distortion with simultaneous capturing time dilation (both caused by the same passing gravitational wave)?
