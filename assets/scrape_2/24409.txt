What would theoretically be dissolved in the interior oceans of icy moons and planets?

I know we have some indication of "what's in the water" from the plumes of Enceladus, but would other places be the same. For instance, could the deep liquid water of Titan contain dissolved methane gas?
I'm mainly contemplating what possible "solutions" would be beneficial to some form of microbiology.
