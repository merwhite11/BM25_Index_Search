Did I see the dragon capsule on Friday night?

I live just south of Sydney Australia, and I went outside to watch the ISS pass overhead on Friday night. The ISS was following a smaller object easily visible to the naked eye.
Sydney time 20.43 or UTC 9.43. (Friday March 8) The smaller object was ahead of the ISS by maybe 25 degrees. Appeared to be moving at exactly the same speed and trajectory.
Was this the the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule? Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.
