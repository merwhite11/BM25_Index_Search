What makes protoplanetary disks start rotating? (Initial energy needed to rotate)

Planets form from a protoplanetary disk that has been rotating around its star. The initial energy that makes them rotate really matters to me.

Why did the protoplanetary disk start rotating around the star?
Where did the initial energy to rotate come from?
Why hasn't all the disk material been swallowed by the star?
