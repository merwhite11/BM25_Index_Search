Is there a verification of the solar system barycenter as it is theoretically determined?

The barycenter of our solar system is not the sun, but a changeable location outside of the center point of the sun. A often used diagram of that relation is shown below, originated from the Wikipedia article. 
Does exist one or more practical quite observations that confirm the accordance of the real changing of position of the barycenter of the solar system in relation to the center point of the sun with the theoretical results?
