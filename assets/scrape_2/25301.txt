How is Phosphorus made in in stars?

What elements are required to fuse into phosphorus in a star. Can someone give me a step by step process please e.g 

4 hydrogen nuclei fuse into one helium nuclei and then 3 helium nuclei
  fuse into carbon inside a red giant etc.
1H x 4 = 1HE, 1HE x 3 = 1C etc.
