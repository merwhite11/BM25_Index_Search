Meaning of critical density in radiative transfer

I do not understand completely the meaning of critical density when talking about atomic or molecular line emission in astrophysical gas clouds: I know that it is way more complex than this, but just taking the two levels approximation (i.e. an atom/molecule with two quantum levels, 1 and 2, where 2 is the upper one) the critical density would be
$n_c = A_{12}/\gamma_{12}$, where $A_{12}$ is the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous radiative emission (i.e. de-excitation) and $\gamma_{12}$ the collisional de-excitation probability.
It seems to me that if the gas density is $n < n_c$ the radiative de-excitations dominate, so I would expect to see the photons; conversely if $n>n_c$ collisions dominate, so the particles will lose energy through collisions before having enough time to spontaneously decay and emit photons.
This argument of mine, however, seems to be wrong, because everybody use $n_c$ exactly in the opposite way: I see the photons only if $n>n_c$. I would expect that for $n \ll n_c$ the particles are experiencing almost no collisions, so neither collisional excitation, and they do not decay because they are not excited in the first place; but I feel that something wrong has been written in the previous lines, so I would like to read someone's opinion about it before to make even more pie in the sky conjectures.
