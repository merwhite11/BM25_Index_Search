What's still needed before we can observe orbits of exomoons thereby weighing exoplanets?

Comments below this answer to How do we weigh a planet? point out that we currently cannot (or at least have not) detect moons around exoplanets, much less measure the sizes and periods of their orbits around their planets.
I commented there that:

...detecting exoplanets wasn't possible, nor did direct imaging of planetary systems, nor did making parallax measurements from the Kuiper belt, nor was the detection of gravitational waves...

my point being that impossibly challenging observations keep getting done.
So I'd like to ask what the most likely extension of observational Astronomy would be that would allow for the measurement of the period of exomoons thereby weighing exoplanets.
Is it simply a pair of space telescopes in a halo orbit with laser interferometry between them and plenty of time? Could it be done from Earth? After all, exoplanetary systems are already imaged from Earth.
