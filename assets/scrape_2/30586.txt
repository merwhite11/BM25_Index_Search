Could an object, assuming possible, escape black hole by travelling above constant speed?

I am always hearing that after travelling inside a given BH's event horizon, the escape velocity is greater than c, which makes it impossible to escape. 
Suppose an ship is inside a BH. Assume it is possible to travel faster than c. If the ship applied the faster-than-light travel, would it be able to escape a black hole?
Furthermore, it seems to me that above event horizon, the escape velocity is less than c, while inside event horizon, the escape velocity is greater than c. This leads to a further question: Does the escape velocity increase the closer you get to a BH's singularity?
