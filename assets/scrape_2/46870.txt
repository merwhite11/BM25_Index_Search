Is the information about space we have old?

As we know light has a definite speed i.e. $c=299792458$ m/s so it takes some big time to travel from distant galaxies, right? So I always wonder about the big telescopes and big space companies captured the photos of very distant galaxies. Are they as they were many generations ago or they are fresh (means we see what happened at the time of capture)
Like the GN-z11 galaxy the farthest known galaxy to man!

From previous studies, the galaxy GN-z11 seems to be the farthest detectable galaxy from us, at 13.4 billion light-years, or 134 nonillion kilometers (that's 134 followed by 30 zeros) ~stated by Nobunari Kashikawa


Does the picture depict an older time? Like light may have taken $13.4$ billion years to travel, so the galaxy might be that much old?  Does this mean the observable universe might be older than I might think?
