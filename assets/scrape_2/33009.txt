Have more recent LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave measurements narrowed down the speed of gravity further?

This answer to How precise are the observational measurements for the speed of gravity? says:

...in 2013 a Chinese group built a model using Earth's tides that helped them narrow it down.

... [T]he speeds of gravity are from 0.93 to 1.05 times the speed of light with a relative error of about 5%. This provides first set of strong evidences to show that the speed of gravity is the same as the speed of light.

This is so far the most accurate measurement I've seen.  See the paper for more.
In the near future, LIGO may be able to provide more accurate measurements by comparing the distance among detectors and the delay of observation.

In case the links break, the papers are:

update: As noted in @amateurAstro's comment and linked well-sourced answer the time between a gravitational wave detection and X-ray burst of GW170817 and GRB 170817A constrains the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be "...between $-3 \times  10^{-15}$ and $+7 \times 10^{-16}$ times the speed of light..."
So my updated question is:
