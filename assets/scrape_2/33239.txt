Does the universe curve in on itself?

I've read a little bit about the universe, but its not clear to me if there is a place in the universe beyond which there are no stars.
For example, is there anywhere in the universe that one could go where we would not generally see stars in every direction?  Its seems uncertain to me that there is.
If I were to go to the farthest star from earth magically, rather the via relatively (for argument sake).  I"m guessing it would have stars surrounding it in every direction.  But perhaps I'm wrong, perhaps there is some edge to the explosion of matter from the big bang, beyond which there is nothing.
Do we know if the universe curves in on itself? or is there some other dominant theory?
