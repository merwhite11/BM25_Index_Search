What causes Titan a moon to have a denser atmosphere than that of a Mars?

I'm wondering about Mars and Titan. If Mars is larger than Titan how come it lost most of its atmosphere? Mars also has a magnetic field while Titan doesn't. Yet Titans atmospheric pressure on the surface is a whopping 1.5 times that of Earth's. 
Question: What causes Mars not to have much of an atmosphere, but Titan does?
