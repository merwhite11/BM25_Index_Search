How might WFIRST help us better understand dark energy?

In the video linked in the Space.com article What Would It Mean for Astronomers If the WFIRST Space Telescope Is Killed?, (available in YouTube as WFIRST: The Best of Both Worlds) after 02:00 Caltech cosmologist Yun Wang says:

WFIRST will allow us to potentially make ground-breaking discoveries, finding out what dark energy is. So this will tell us if dark energy is an unknown form of energy, or if its a modification of general relativity.

Without going too deep in to GR, how might that happen? 
Question: What kinds of WFIRST observations  and interpretations would be used to potentially address the nature of dark energy? 
Based on comments, I'll reclassify the following as an afterthought:
Is this in any way related to news about a recent observational non-exclusion of Erik Verlinde's theories (the guy who's "Trying to kill dark matter"), discussed in Margot Brouwer's 2016 video Verlindes new theory first tested with weak gravitational lensing about the VLT Survey Telescope kilo-degree survey results (see also Cosmos Magazine's New theory of ‘dark gravity’ passes first test, but Einstein’s still on top, or am I mixing apples and oranges?
