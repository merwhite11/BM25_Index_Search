Does cosmological horizon grow or decrease as it radiates?

Black holes decrease as they evaporate and their radius decreases as well.
So what is with a cosmological horizon?
If cosmological horizon is just a black hole centered at the opposite side of the universe, we should see the radius of the external space groving as the radius of the BH decreases.
But if the radiation decreases the horizon entropy we should see the area of the horizon decreasing.
What is the correct conclusion?
