Is our supercluster part of a galaxy filament?

It was discovered recently that the Milky Way galaxy lies inside a supercluster named Laniakea Supercluster. On the other hand, wikipedia says that galaxy filaments are "the largest known structures in the universe"

My question is: is the Laniakea Supercluster part of a galaxy filament, and if so, what's the name of the galaxy filament?
