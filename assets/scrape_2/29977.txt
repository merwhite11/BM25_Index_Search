Why Venus evolved so differently from Earth?

I read somewhere that the reason why Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect and Earth doesn't is the former's inability to form separate tectonic plates due to slightly higher temperature softening the then-cooling tectonic plate, preventing its fracture and thus disabling the $\mathrm{CO}_2$ scrubbing function of tectonic activity, which absorbs $\mathrm{CO}_2$ from air by rock weathering and then puts it back into the mantle. And once $\mathrm{CO}_2$ is a runaway in the atmosphere $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ and $\text{SO}_2$ will join forces with it multiplying the greenhouse effect. Therefore, the surface temperature of Venus rose to astonishing values long before life formed on Earth. Is this theory at least possibly correct?
