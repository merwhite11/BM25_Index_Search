What (if any) role did Earth play in the evolution of the solar system?

We all know that Jupiter played a great role in the Solar System by cleaning up debris and dust from the Solar System, and deflecting asteroids. Saturn also played a similar role. Uranus and Neptune helped Earth by sending water ice-rich comets our way to enrich our planet with water, and now deflect rowdy Kuiper Belt objects.
But, Earth does not seem to play any role in the Solar System. It simply looks as if it is just a honorary guest in the Solar System, just idling in the Solar System. But it must be doing something, like protecting a planet from radiation, or deflecting asteroids away in the Solar System.
