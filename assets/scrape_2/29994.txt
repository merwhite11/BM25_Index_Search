Why is the moon that special? Is it really a well built coincidence?

I find it funny that the moon is the only object in the solar system to almost perfectly fit the sun, resulting in the spectacular solar eclipses. No other object except maybe a few irregular moons like Pandora from Saturn would do that, and for them, they aren't round, and thus can't fully block out all light. The moon also has a perfect rotation that is almost exactly the same as Earth's rotational period, resulting in a tidal lock, which causes tides. 
Is this a coincidence? Any speculation on why this happens? Is this the only observed place where such criteria play into such perfect coincidence?
