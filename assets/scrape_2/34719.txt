Saw 8 stars moving in same direction one by one

I saw 8 stars moving in the same direction one by one and then at the same point they faded or you can say disappear. The speed was not too fast but not too slow either. I am more curious because there were 8 of them and one by one they came from the same direction, move in the same direction and disappear at the same place. What could it be satellites or were the actually stars?
