If my eyes were really big, would I see radio waves?

Considering an assertion that the fundamental difference between different ‘types’ of electromagnetic waves is frequency/wavelength, and larger antennas are needed for longer wavelengths, if my eyes were larger proportional to the difference in wavelength between visible light waves and radio waves, would they see radio waves?
