What is the best estimate for the radius of Shoemaker-Levy 9?

I have been digging through various scientific articles on modelling the breakup of SL9 to attempt to ascertain its intial size, yet the various estimates vary tremendously.
A radius of 700 m - 1000 m is a common estimate, but some have predicted 2000 m - 2500 m (and even higher).
I know there cannot be "consensus" on such a matter, as the comet was never directly observed before its tidal disruption in July 1992, but what is the best estimate and/or accepted range for the radius of the comet?
