Can a telescope ever increase the apparent luminance of an extended object?

From what I know about common telescope designs, telescopes don't increase the apparent luminance of extended objects compared to the luminance seen with the naked eye. In this sense extended objects don't appear "brighter" (per unit solid angle of object/image), although the total light flux received from the object (the illuminance) can increase due to the increased magnification (the object looks bigger through the telescope). The best that can be done is keep the luminance the same, which requires eliminating transmission losses. In addition to transmission losses, the light received by the eye per unit solid angle of image is further reduced at high magnifications when the exit pupil is smaller than the viewer's pupil.
Can there be no telescope design (purely optical, e.g. without using electronic eyepieces) that makes extended objects appear "brighter" (in the above sense) than with the naked eye, by somehow overcoming the limitation of the observer's pupil? If so, can this be proven? If not, what would such a design look like?
