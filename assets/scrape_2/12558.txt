Is there an upper limit to the mass of terrestrial planets?

The exoplanet Kepler-10c has a mass between 15 and 19 times the mass of the Earth (making it comparable in mass to Neptune), and yet is thought to have a density of about 7g/cm3 and to be a terrestrial planet, with a substantial proportion of "hot ice" 
Is there an upper limit to the mass of terrestrial planets, or can rocky planets form that are larger than Kepler-10c?
This, older, article in Universe Today suggests that terrestrial planets can't form more than 5-10 Earth Masses, substantially smaller than Kepler 10c.
