Why are there no green stars?

There are red stars, and orange stars, and yellow stars, and blue stars, and they are all understandable save the fact that there is a 'gap': There are no green stars. 
Is this because of hydrogen's chemical properties (e.g. the emission spectrum) or some other reason? Or are there just green stars that I have no idea of? If so, I need some pictures; they must look awesome.
