Estimate upper limits on flux values in the case of a non-detection?

I have ALMA data which are non-detections of some spectral lines in a protoplanetary disk. The data is in the form of spectral cubes. I am hoping to estimate an upper limit on the flux of each of the spectral lines, given the fact they are not detected.
What is the standard procedure for doing this?
So far, I have tried following the procedure outlined in Carney et al. (2019)...

Create a 'Keplerian mask', so that only pixels associated with the position and velocity of the disk are included
Apply the mask to the spectral cube, and generate an integrated intensity map
Measure the rms in the integrated intensity map
Translate the measured rms into an upper limit

I am having trouble with step 4. In Carney et al. (2019), they use the formula:
$\sigma = \delta \nu \sqrt{N} \sigma_{\text{rms}}$
where $\sigma$ is the flux upper limit, $\delta \nu$ is the channel width, $N$ is the number of independant measurements, and $\sigma_{\text{rms}}$ is the measured rms per channel.
I'm not sure exactly how to apply this to my data? Or is there another way to estimate an upper limit on the flux?
