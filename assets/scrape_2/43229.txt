I have a scientific paper on gravity, how do I publish it, and will my research benefit me?

I read a lot about gravity and discovered a hole in it, and I want to publish that hole, but I am not good at mathematics. To show that gap, what should I do? Should I use Newton's equations which are easy in my research, or fight and read about Einstein's equations which are very difficult
