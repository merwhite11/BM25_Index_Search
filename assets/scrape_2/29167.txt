What are the challenges for the building and data analysis of the CHIME telescope?

The  Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) has discovered the second repeated fast radio burst recently. However, its structure is simple apparently. I wonder why we did not build a telescope before. What is the challenge? I just know that its data volume is large.
It is difficult to update the telescope?
There are 4 cylinders and 1024 antennas. What determines the distribution of the 1024 antennas? I mean why is it not just one longer cylinder?
