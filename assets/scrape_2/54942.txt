What is everything wrong with this theory of dark matter?

So I had a hypothesis about why dark matter exists, but seeing as I've just barely begun studying astrophysics its most likely chock full of misconceptions and oversights. Here's a  diagram of the idea and an explanation below.

So the top image shows a 3 dimensional representation of spacetime. The star is bending spacetime allowing the planet to orbit it along with the dark matter (they should also be bending it but I was too lazy to draw it. So these objects only exist in the 2D universe shown below if they intersect with the universe and a cross section of it exists within that universe. So if the dark matter falls below the universe, not intersecting it, then it wouldn't be perceptible to them but still would cause an overall increase in mass and changes the orbits of the objects around it. So if you scaled this up to the third and fourth dimension, would this still be applicable or is it just inherently flawed?
