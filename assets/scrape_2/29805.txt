How would the Tycho Impact have appeared from Earth?

The Tycho crater is thought to be the youngest major impact on the Moon, estimated at 108 million years ago. This puts it firmly in the reign of the dinosaurs, I find myself curious as to what our thunder-lizard brethren would have witnessed.

Roughly how bright would the initial flash have been? Would a glowing scar have been left on the Moon for days, weeks or months? Would the Earth have been subject to spectacular global meteor showers from ejected debris? Would any other effects have been felt on Earth? I'd guess that a simulation would be required to accurately answer these questions but I'm hoping that some reasonable estimates can be made by comparison of studies of other impacts.
Finally, was the Tycho impact of greater or smaller magnitude than the Shoemakerâ€“Levy 9 impact in 1994?
