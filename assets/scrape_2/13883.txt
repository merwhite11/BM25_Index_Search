When you travel fast around a black hole, do you experience high speed yourself?

When an object in the space comes close to a massive body (like a black hole or a neutron star), we see from Earth that its speed significantly increases while it is close to the body. As we know, this is due to space distortion around massive objects known as gravity. But also, gravity causes time dilation, so an observer near a black hole will experience less time spans between same events than a far-away observer. So, the question is: if we travel on an asteroid and come close to a black hole, will we experience an increase in our speed, or the time dilation will compensate space distortion and we'll feel the same movement speed as before (i. e. no acceleration)?
