What kind of star would allow for life like our Sun/Earth and then go nova?

In the Star Trek Prime Universe, Star Trek:  The Original Series, the home stars of the Fabrini, Platoans and Sarpeidons went nova, while in Star Trek:  The Next Generation one of the stars in the Bynar system (which might have been a multiple system) went supernova.
What type of star would allow sentient life to evolve to an advanced level, roughly to the same as twenty-first century Earth, and then go nova.
