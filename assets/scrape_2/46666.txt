Could the Hubble Constant be an artifact of the structure, and thus a way to directly measure the universes's age?

"Expressed in inverse years, the value 70 km/s/Mpc comes to about one divided by 14 billion years - the approximate age of the universe."
Could the Hubble Constant be an artifact of the structure, and thus a way to roughly directly measure its age? The fact expansion is, or seems to be, accelerating (Reiss et al) would strengthen this hypothesis.
Could perhaps an advanced civilization could measure it with far more precision than we could, and would find the Hubble Constant a direct "age tag" marker? Or is this merely a remarkable coincidence?
Would a hypothetical observer in the distant future be able to use it to directly measure the universes`s age then? (Current theory says "no, it just seems coincidental today").
