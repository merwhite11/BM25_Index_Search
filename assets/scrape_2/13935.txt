What are gravitational waves actually?

I read about the LIGo experiment recently, but i didn't understand their significance. Although, it's clear to me that the gravitational waves do exist and are caused by large accelerating bodies in space.
but how are they significant to Humans as we do not have any mechanisms for harnessing these waves and Don't know what use they may be of.
