Galactic orbits and distance between stars

In the context of whether or not nearby stars were created from the same nebula, this answer states:

imagine two stars with very similar orbits, one with a period of 200 million years and the other with a period of 210 million years. If they start off right next to each other, then after 2 billion years, the first star has made 10 complete orbits, while the second has made about 9.5 -- meaning it will now be on the other side of the galaxy from the first star.

How close would the two stars have originally been to have such different orbital periods?
