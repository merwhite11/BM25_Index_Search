What makes the coming comet increase/decrease in brightness?

I understand C/1979 Atlas Y4 is potentially going to rapidly increase in brightness and visibility to the point we can see it very well in May-ish, in the Northern hemisphere.
I am wondering why it's not predictable whether or not it will, or what processes affect the brightness.  If it's simply reflection, why would it dim or brighten? I really don't think I understand comets.
