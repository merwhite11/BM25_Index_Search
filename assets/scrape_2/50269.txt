What could cause a wind from an SMBH

In this paper, the author tests whether the Milky Way's Fermi bubbles could have been caused by an AGN-type explosion, or by a 'wind'. He comes to the conclusion that the wind may be "the same as active galactic nucleus outflows", and that it picks up interstellar gas on the way out of the GC. This paper also talks about SMBH winds. He rules out stellar wind from stars forming near the Galactic Centre.
What causes AGN outflows and these 'winds'? Is it purely mass and energy outflows from the accretion disk of the SMBH?
