Can someone tell me the contribution of s-, r-, and p-isotope processes to copper?

I have looked for relevant information in the paper Chemical evolution with rotating massive star yields
II. A new assessment of the solar s- and r- process
components before, but unfortunately, it only records the element gallium.
