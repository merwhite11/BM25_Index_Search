What was the the value of the Hubble constant at the time of the CMB's 'release' (i.e., 379,000 years after Big Bang)?

What about its value roughly 9 billion years after the Big Bang, when dark energy started to 'take over' and accelerate the expansion of the universe?
Is there a timeline or chart somewhere that shows approximate, theoretical values of Hubble's not-so-constant constant throughout the lifetime of the Universe?
