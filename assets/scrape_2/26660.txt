Can a planet's gravity rip out its moon's atmosphere?

We all know that solar flares can rip a planet's atmosphere if the magnetic field is weak.Solar flares travel at tremendous speed so when they hit the gas molecules of a atmosphere the molecules are ejected from the gravitational pull and thrown away.
Can a giant planet's gravity pull out its moons atmosphere?Is gravity enough to pull its atmosphere or do we need an instantaneous force/impact to blow away an atmosphere?
