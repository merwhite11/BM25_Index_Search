(Sound) Echo from X takes 5-7 days,

Hey I want to describe an event A happening roughtly 5-7 after event B. I'd like to describe it as the 'A happened after the sound of B echo'd off X', where X is recognisable space thingy... 
(I'm talking mildly poetically, so I'm aware there is no sound in space, but I'm interested in what X might be, if such a thing was possible - if it makes you feel better you can use light and I'll describe 'A happened before X saw B') :)
