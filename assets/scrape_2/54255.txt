Do all orbits emit gravitational waves?

In principle, all orbits in the universe should progressively decay due to the emission of gravitational waves. However, does this always happen? Are there any kind of orbits that do not decay as they do not emit gravitational waves? Perhaps if the orbit is perfectly axially symmetric with an even distribution of mass?...
