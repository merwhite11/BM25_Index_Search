How can I compute reasonable errors on my Gaussian fits to the observed strong optical lines of interest?

I'm fitting Gaussians to optical lines spanning from H-beta to Sulfur using Astropy's Gaussian (https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/api/astropy.modeling.functional_models.Gaussian1D.html) model with a LevMarLSQFitter (https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.modeling.fitting.LinearLSQFitter.html). My goal is to perform strong line diagnostics on my target of interest.
I plot the fits on top of the data and am returned the nominal values and standard deviations of the fit. Everything looks reasonable (I know the data quality is less than ideal); however, the standard deviations for the sulfur lines are consistently several times larger than the nominal value. This issue occurs for the two sulfur lines in every fiber (IFU data).
I’ve tried limiting the spectral region given to the fitter, not limiting it, and fitting a double line simultaneously (as opposed to fitting the two S lines individually), but I still have the same issue. ie. I either get inf, none, or a huge value for the STD. I don’t think this data is high quality enough to completely reinvent what I’m doing, but I still want to report something reasonable until better data is accessible.
Attached is sample of the data and the fit on top. As you can see, the fit to the sulfur lines are reasonable. I'm looking for suggestions on how to compute an error on these fits and am open to suggestions.
The S lines can be seen on the right hand side. They are the last two on the right (around 6766-6785 Angstroms).
