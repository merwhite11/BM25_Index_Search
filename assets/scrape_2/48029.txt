Are there any naked-eye visible stars in our Milky Way that are particularly rich in calcium? (I'm just curious)

There are Calcium-rich supernovae but here I'm asking about stars that one might see in the night sky.
I'd like to ask if there are any naked-eye (or binocular-assisted) visible stars in our Milky Way that are particularly rich in calcium?
Asking this question for a hypothesis I am developing, but that's outside the scope of this question.
