What was that single file line formation of flashing plane lights flying in the sky at night?

It was here on the west coast at 5 am pacific standard time when I went outside for a smoke when out of the corner of my eye what looks like a plane with flashing lights going across the sky when all of a sudden there was another... and another... and another! For more than 15 minutes I watched these "planes" flying overhead in a single file line formation. There's no way that many planes or satellites traveling in a single file line formation from the east, over the pacific ocean, to the west and heading inland. I've NEVER seen anything like that before in my almost 30 years of living and stargazing. WHAT DID I SEE?!?! I have to know because this was by no means a normal evening/morning. To top it off there were other "planes" or "satellites" flying in the same direction as the others traveling in the single file line formation almost as if they were off course and ended up flying outside of the designated flight pattern. Nothing I've looked up explains this... Why? The date is april 12th 2020 and even though it's a pretty old phone I got a 3 and a half minute video before I went back inside to look them up on the internet only to find NOTHING. The sun is peaking and starting to hide the stars and I CAN STILL SEE the single file line formation of flashing plane lights in the sky traveling overhead more than 30 minutes later. What on gods green earth did I witness?
