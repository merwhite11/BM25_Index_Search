Was time different before the great inflation?

In time different during the first second after Big Bang than it is now? Inflation had a dramatic effect on space, and spacetime is one thing. Was the properties of time affected too? Curved spacetime around black holes cause funny effects for outside observers, infalling objects appear to never reachthe event horizon. The very early universe was even denser. When we talk about the first second, are such effects accounted for?
