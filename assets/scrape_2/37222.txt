Is there a way to know if there are/are not solar-system-like systems of objects without a star?

There's an extremely high amount of variation in All of Known Existence. We do see many many stars, with an extensive amount of evidence for planets orbiting around stars. However, is there are way to determine whether or not there's something like a 'dark solar system'? That's the only thing I can think of to call it.
This would be made out of a central body of mass, where the majority of material is located, with smaller planet-like objects in orbit around it, not unlike Pluto and its satellites.
Well, what about nearly-massive-enough-to-be-stellar objects? Why would there not be more of these - and the inevitable satellites involved in something of that mass - than there are solar systems?
I'm also assuming these would be made out of the same material that nearly everything else is, and I would expect them to be in abundance, so, could this explain the dark matter mystery? Assuming these dark systems are made out of the same - or mostly the same - material, wouldn't that also mean that spectral analysis wouldn't be able to determine if light from stars passed through the dark systems?
Intuition tells me someone has already debunked this, but I haven't been able to find an answer one way or the other. (yet)
