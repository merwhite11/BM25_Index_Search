Do more massive stars become larger or smaller white dwarfs?

I wonder whether e.g. stars more massive than the Sun (but below the mass where they'd go supernova) would become larger or smaller white dwarfs than a white dwarf Sun. Since Procyon B is larger than the more massive Sirius B, I suppose the more massive the star the smaller its remnant white dwarf would become. Am I right and if so, why is it like this?
