Are there any moons of minor planets that orbit at high inclination to the plane of rotation of the parent body?

It occurred to me that one of the ringed asteroids or minor planets may answer this question about the alignment of planetary rings. However, it appears that the rings of Chariklo, Haumea and Chiron (possible rings) are within a few degrees of the plane of rotation of the asteroid.
My thinking was that minor planets with low gravity may be able to capture/maintain moons at a higher orbital inclination than larger planets, and those moons will not be in distant orbits as described here.  Satellites could also be formed by collisions and their spin evolution is described in this article.  I think there may be an argument that the YORP effect and other tumbling or precession effects could lead to unusual orbital attitudes for natural satellites perhaps?
There are four hundred and sixteen minor planets that have moons, are any of those moons known to orbit at high inclinations to the plane of rotation of the parent body?
