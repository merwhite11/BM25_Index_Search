How much of carbon, sodium, silicon, and magnesium does the Sun have?

I've just begun learning of Astronomy and I can't figure out why any stars would begin their life with such elements if nuclear fusion hasn't created them.
Don't all stars begin life as Hydrogen?
I understand that the presence of these elements can change the luminosity of the given star. Is this also correct?
