How many iridium layers do we know, besides the K-Pg one (the dinosaur killer "smoking gun")?

The hypothesis of a large asteroid impact playing a role in dinosaurs extinction was strengthened by the discovery of a global iridium anomaly in the geologic record, at the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary.
Given we still have several unconfirmed impact craters, for example, the 21 km diameter São Miguel do Tapuio structure centered at 5°37.6′S, 41°23.3′W in Brazil(1), close to my city:

Wouldn't a systematic search for other iridium layers in the geologic record help prove/disprove many structures like this as produced by a impact event? Or even know about impact events that were previously unknown, because the resulting craters were completely eroded and became unrecognizable? Global petroleum exploration surely left a lot of rock plugs that could be searched for such layers. Yet the only iridium anomaly I see people writing about is the famous K-Pg one. So, how many of these do we know? Or has nobody ever bothered seeking them?
