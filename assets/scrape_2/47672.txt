How to calculate the goldilocks zones of brown dwarf stars? Do any encroach on the stars' Roche limit?

Ignoring tidal heating and such, how can one calculate the habitable orbital ranges for  M, L, T, and Y spectral class stars?
The reason I ask is that I'm also curious if any of these zones encroach on their respective Roche limits.
