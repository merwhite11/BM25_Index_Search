Why does the angular size of the Moon change?

I know that the orbit of the moon is elliptical.
But I cannot understand this graph:

The number of 'bumps' in the graph is around 13~14 in a year, so I concluded that the each 'bump' indicates one lunar month.
But why aren't these bumps symmetrical? Since the moon revolves around the Earth once in one lunar month, shouldn't they be symmetrical?
