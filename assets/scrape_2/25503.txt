Did I see Pluto with my naked eye?

Early this morning going out on the balcony, I looked up on a star chart app to verify it was Jupiter I was seeing. Then I noticed the alignment of Mars, Saturn, and Pluto on the app.
Never being able to identify it before, I stared at where Pluto should be and I'm pretty sure I saw it.
My only question is - since it's said that planets shine and stars twinkle, it did seem that Pluto was flicking a bit. Is this normal?  Something to do with the relatively low luminosity and greater length of space?
