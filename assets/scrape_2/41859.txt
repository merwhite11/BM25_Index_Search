Objects beyond 13.3 billion light-years away are (apparently) moving away from us at faster-than-light speeds?

That is, if you use the cosmic distance ladder method, and a value of about 73.5 for the Hubble constant....
But, if you plug in the Planck CMB value of about 67.5, you get a distance of about 14.5 billion light years, beyond which objects seem to be moving away from us at superluminal speeds...
Are those values correct?
