How rare are earth-like solar eclipses?

Solar eclipses on the earth are so spectacular because the moon has roughly the same size as the sun when viewed from the earth's surface. This is an incredible coincidence, and my guess is that it is a very uncommon phenomenon in the universe.
Is it possible to say anything sensible about the likelihood of a planet having a moon and a sun with same apparent size? Is it possible to make an educated guess about how many places in the universe you would be able to see an earth-like solar eclipse?
