Any night sky image databases

I was wondering if there were any available databases for photos of the night sky. It doesn't have to feature pictures of any particular star, just has to be a large collection of photos from the night sky. I would just go off google images, but those images are heavily biased in favor of exceptional views. 
Preferably ones taken from ground level, like pictures of what would be visible to a normal person without equipment.
