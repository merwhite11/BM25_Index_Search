Why did the moon abruptly change positions in the sky?

Three or four weeks ago I was outside showing my neighbors how cool the moon was through a 'backyard' telescope in broad daylight (~8PM PDT).  It was 3/4 of the way across the sky (setting behind the houses behind us.)  Two weeks later the moon was not even up yet at 8PM.  The planets I've been watching (Jupiter, Saturn, Mars) are all rising and setting a little earlier each day as I would expect.
Why did the moon abruptly change its position in the sky a couple of weeks ago?
