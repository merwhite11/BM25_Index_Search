Is a supernova's core temperature absolute zero just before collapse?

I thought a supernova's core temperature was absolute zero just before it collapsed, as it has run out of all nuclear and thermal energy, but I haven't been able to confirm this online anywhere and I was wondering if anyone can confirm this for me.
