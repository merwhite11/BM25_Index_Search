Is there a significant temperature difference on the moon from apogee to perigee or vice-versa?

Do those few thousand kilometers of difference going around the earth significantly affect the amount of thermal energy the moon receives from the sun to warm up its surface?
Also, are there more significant differences between these variables when the earth goes from perihelion to aphelion and vice-versa?
