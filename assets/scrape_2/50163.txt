Does magnetosphere have an influence on where meteorites would impact on Earth?

I have an interest in geology and I have taken an interest in learning about meteorites recently. This may be a redundant question but it seems as if there are meteorite rich areas where there seem to be a larger accumulation of meteorites relative to other areas.
Since meteorites are magnetized, does the earth's magnetosphere or the magnetic grid, the same that cause aurora borealis, have a direct effect or influence on where meteorites are more likely to impact or land on earth?
If so, does this Indicate, fluctuations in the strength of the magnetosphere, and why meteorites are pulled to certain areas? Much like tiny pieces of graphite being pulled to a magnet.
