The contents of potential "message" in the Wow! signal lost?

The Wow! signal is still an enigma. 
I understand the incredibly high signal strength it entails. This during some time-period because the sweep of the alignment (or rather the receiving station). That could explain the rise and falloff. This because the horns tracking of that part of sky, once, because of earths movement.
The signal never returned. Everybody understands the narrow band of the signal, and the frequency of the hydrogen line. This incredible signal strength was logged, but only that, the spectacular strength. 
But the contents of said signal was not logged, it was not even capable of recording that. Is this right? Is there a possibility that the burst could have carried information, however unlikely? It could have carried a one-time "message"? Is this correct?
