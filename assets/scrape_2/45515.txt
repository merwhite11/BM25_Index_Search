Is the event horizon the defining characteristic of a black hole?

I was wondering about the characteristics of a black hole, and I know they have mass, spin, and an insanely strong gravitational force. But, as far as I know, basically all black holes possess the event horizon. In fact, according to Wikipedia and our friend, Stephen Hawking:

"the absence of event horizons means that there are no black holes"

So...does that make the EH the defining characteristic of a black hole? Or can I say something is a black hole if it has an equal gravitational strength? Thanks!
