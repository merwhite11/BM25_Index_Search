Why don't we see the galaxy center?

When we look at the sky, and see the Milky Way, we mainly see a band, with no real center.
On a more accurate picture we can guess the center of the galaxy (see this picture), but we still don't see the center as some kind of big bright "star", like on this picture.
I know there is a lot of objects (stars, planets and dust) between us and the center of the galaxy. But stars are bright and they shouldn't "hide" the galaxy center's light since they shine too.
Why don't we see the galaxy center as a "night sun"?
How much dust is there so it's blocking the galaxy center's light?
Is it because of all Oort clouds of all solar systems that we don't see the galaxy center clearly?
