The Matter Anti Matter Asymmetry

The matter anti matter asymmetry is still a mystery that still can't be explained. But what if there wasn't an asymmetry? Isn't it possible that there was exactly equal amounts of matter and anti matter which did in fact annihilate each other, and the energy released from it was converted into mass? I know this arises a lot of paradoxes like if so what kind of matter is everything then . I guess what I really want to know more about is, after a Matter and Anti Matter collision, what kind of matter can be created (or rather converted) from the resulting energy outburst?
