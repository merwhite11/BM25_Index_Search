Period estimate

How would you estimate the period or range of periods for two stars, please? I know the right ascension, declination, and distance.
I could estimate the masses and assume that the stars are in apocentrum. Which other parameters do I need to know?
I cannot use Kepler law, right?
$$P = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{a^3}{G(M_1+M_2)}}$$
