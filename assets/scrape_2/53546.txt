Mysterious Object In The Sky

On Stellarium (https://stellarium-web.org), I found this mysterious object floating in the sky.
It is at 6h40m29s,-13ยบ23'30" on the equatorial grid.
It is surrounded by HD 47366, HD 47182, and HD 47667.
The closest well-known star is Sirius.

Can anyone explain what this is?
