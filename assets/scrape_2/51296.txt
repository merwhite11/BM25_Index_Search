Could the newly discovered glow in the solar system be antimatter?

Could the newly discovered glow in the solar system be a sparse cloud of interstellar antimatter slowly annihilating with the solar wind?
The glow I am talking about is discussed at: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/hubble-detects-ghostly-glow-surrounding-our-solar-system
I also wonder if this could be checked by looking for a corresponding gamma ray glow?
