Can a photon orbit around a galaxy?

There are a lot of questions about photons orbitting a black hole, but I'm interested if a photon can orbit a galaxy. Our Milky Way for example has a radius of 52000 light years (according to Google) so a photon would need to travel 52000 years to complete a circle - perhaps enough time to bend its path even for weak gravity?
Likewise, is it possible for a photon to orbit around a galaxy cluster?
