Axial wobble or binary star system

Is our solar system affected by a body unobserved as of yet that causes our solar system to curve through space in an orbit? Is this idea outlandish or us there any evidence to support it? Consider this information: 

"In 2007 Voyager 2 unexpectedly reached the edge of the heliosphere at a distance approximately 1.5 billion km less than the distance traveled by Voyager 1, indicating the SS is bullet shaped in the direction of the interstellar magnetic field." 

Another bit of information is that a binary system with a moving SS was suggested as far back in modern times as 1894 -- with predictions 40x more accurate than an earth wobble to calculate precession of equinoxes (over 100 years). 
Also unknown to me was precession was observed millennia ago, for which we have some records, but today's accepted notion was formed in the 1850's -- before it was accepted that the solar system even moved. Our current theory of precession takes no account for SS movement. Zero. 
Lasly local bodies do not precess at all, only distant stars and -- from what I understand -- all of them. 

Is a binary star system just bunk? Can it be tested for? 
Is the axial wobble theory tried tested and come up true every time or Does this theory have predictability issues that have to be tweeked constantly? 
Why is it that the moons orbit around the earth, as well as the earths orbit around the sun, are increasing and the precessional cycle is speeding up? Shouldn't that have the opposite effect?
