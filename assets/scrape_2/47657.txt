Can Jupiter's rings be seen with the naked eye by an astronaut nearby? How difficult would it be?

Maybe a basic question, apologies.
I understand that there would be different answers depending on how far is "nearby", depending on how inclined our orbit is, and what is our alignment with the planet and the sun (forward scattering and back scattering). Let's say we are beyond the radiation belts, on Callisto or Themisto, or a spacecraft with an orbit between them, (1.8 to 7 million km)
The glare from the planet can make it very difficult, how much so?
Voyager's, Galileo's, NH's and Juno's(navcam) pics of the rings all had high exposures, the Pioneers couldn't detect them at all.
There is a dense band where Adrastea and Metis orbit , then "gossamer rings", and then a halo... here I ask about the first of these, the densest.
We all know and agree that we would easily be able to see Saturn's rings from every angle, distance and orientation.
How visible are Jupiter's rings from nearby, under what circumstances?
If you can also comment on Uranus' and Neptune's cases I would very much appreciate it.
