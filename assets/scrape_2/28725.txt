Simple rule to find some of the zodiac constellations after sunset?

How do I find some of the constellations of the zodiac without remembering their locations on the sky?
I think it should be quite simple if you are located in the northern hemisphere and you know 
1) which astrological sign it is right now (this month)
2) where the sun set
3) the number of hours left until sunrise
4) the order of the constellations in the circle of the zodiac: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.
Straight forward logic says that it is enough to make calculations in order to understand where they should be, but I can't find any such rule on the internet. Maybe it is not so simple. Have you seen such a rule?
