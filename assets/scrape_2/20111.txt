Telescope Specs

Am new to this field. My son is 9 years old and extremely interested in viewing the Solar system. I do not want to buy a low quality one. I have no idea what to buy, I will have to buy it from Dubai as good quality telescopes are not available where I live.
Please can you help me to choose the right tool. He wants to view as many planets as possible. What would be the right amount to pay in US dollars ?
