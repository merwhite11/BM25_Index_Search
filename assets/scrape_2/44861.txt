If a 1x1x1 Cube from the Sun's surface were scooped , and taken to a sufficiently cold point, say near Jupiter, what would happen to the cube?

Let's assume for the sake of this question that the 1x1x1 cube was scooped by unknown methods, and is instantly brought to somewhere close to Jupiter's orbit without any harm or any change to nearby planets, their conditions and their orbits. What would likely happen to this cube?
Would the colder temperatures at Jupiter's orbit cause the plasma of the cube to reorganize into atoms of Hydrogen and Helium and what not? Would it continue to stay as Plasma, and explosively spread away? Would it still continue to emit light?
