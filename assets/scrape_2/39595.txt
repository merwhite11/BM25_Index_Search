What is the distance from Alpha Centauri to Barnard's Star?

Alpha Centauri AB is the closest star system to Earth (4.366 ly), followed closely by Barnard's star (5.988 ly). The closest star system to Alpha Centauri is Luhman 16 (3.8 ly from α Cen). So I am wondering, what is the distance from α Centauri AB to Barnard's star, and more generally, from one star to a different one (all below 10 pc)?
