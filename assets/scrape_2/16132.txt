Boötes Void numbers, 2016

As a general science (hence Wikipedia!) reader, the latest information I have is that 60 galaxies "have been found and counted" inside the Boötes void, this of 1997.
(1) What is the latest count of galaxies "known" inside the Boötes void?
The Boötes void is a ball 250 million light-years across. (Say, .002 of the width of the visible universe?)  It seems - unbelievable - it has only 60 galaxies.
The "60" value (or some new number since 1997), maybe I am misunderstanding it, or it is misreported, or has a different meaning?  Galaxies are counted in the thousands or tens of thousands, it seems hard to believe in a cosmological space, the number "60" would come up.
So, what is (2) the thinking on how many galaxies there likely are in the Boötes Void? An order of magnitude.  Is it "about 100," or "about a trillion," or what?
What do you (3) normally quote galaxy density in?  Galaxies per Gpc3, or?
Indeed, I am trying to get a (4) comparative sense of galactic density in the Boötes void versus elsewhere. What is the galaxy density in the Boötes void, versus the universe in general, or if it's more meaningful versus perhaps superclusters, walls, or?
Is it "one tenth as dense"?  One zillionth?  One half?  Just how void is that sucker?

Further...
BruceS below has usefully pointed out that, indeed, the "60" galaxies are anyway only in a small tube which apparently cuts through the Boötes Void.
Does this mean that, incredibly, the actual main body of the Boötes Void - putting aside that tube - is literally empty, no galaxies at all??
That seems totally incredible.  I feel we really need a galaxy-counting astronomer to clarify the nature of the Boötes Void.
