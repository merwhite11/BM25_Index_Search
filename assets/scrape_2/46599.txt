What image analysis approaches/algorithms are used to detect near-Earth objects?

Disclaimer: I am not an astronomer or astrophysicist. I'm a computer scientist.
Astronomers collect vast amounts of image data through astronmical surveys.
The data is then analysed for signs of asteroids and comets.

What are the most common algorithms used in this process?
What characteristics does software 'look' for?
Are there any relevant open-source tools?
