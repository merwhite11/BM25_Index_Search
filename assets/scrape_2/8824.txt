How are parachutes usable in other places than Earth?

Mars landings, Moon landings. . . Wherever I see a documentary or still pictures in Wikipedia, there are parachutes in the landing of rovers. Whenever I see them, I ask myself, "How they can it decelerate the speed of rovers, when there is no / thin air?" Something needs to be there to create friction!
