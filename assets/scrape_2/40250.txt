Is there any "scale" for measuring salinity of extraterrestrial water?

Continuation of Is the water underneath Europa's ice cap potable?

The referenced question discussed if water from Europa's ice caps is potable or not and from the answers, it was gathered that the water would be too salty to drink and only the most salt tolerant organisms would barely be able to survive the environment.
How can we measure the amount of "saltiness" for extraterrestrial water? Is there any standard scale which scientists have developed to measure the salinity?
