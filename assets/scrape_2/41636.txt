What increases or decreases the mass and density of a fixed radius star?

Assuming a relatively even proportion of mass and radius, a 0.25 solar masses and radii star would have a density of 22.5003 g/cmÂ³, or about 16 times our Sun's density.
Keeping the radius of 0.25 solar radii, what influences would cause different 0.25 solar radii stars in the main sequence to have higher or lower masses/densities than the "normal" 0.25 solar masses?
