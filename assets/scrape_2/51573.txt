What does it look like to view an annular solar eclipse with the naked eye?

How does the experience of an annular solar eclipse compare to a total solar eclipse? In particular, what does it look like to take a glimpse of an annular solar eclipse with the naked eye? How dark does the ambient light in the enviornment become compared to a total eclipse? I have personally seen a total solar eclipse, and I was impressed by how dark the environment became and how the sun appeared. Does an annular solar eclipse have similar features?
EDIT: Thanks for the input so far, everyone. The related question, Will just a glimpse (less than a second) of sun during partial solar eclipse damage eyes?, is good to know, but not quiet the same question I am asking. I've edited my question for greater clarity. @notovny's comment answers my question. It seems that the moon cannot be discerned with the naked eye (when quickly glimpsed). Nor is the darkening of the ambient outdoor light as impressive as a total solar eclipse.
I saw the '17 total eclipse and was awed. I had been expecting the same experience for the '23 eclipse, but just recently realized that an annular eclipse is not the same as a total eclipse. I was curious how much I needed to temper my expectations. Sounds like I should not be expecting the same level of awe.
Safety note: I understand it is very dangerous to stare at an annular eclipse with the naked eye. I intend to only glimpse the sun for a moment. I have purchased special solar eclipse viewing glasses for prolonged viewing.
