How well is Earth’s motion through the universe quantified?

If I had a time travel machine that could drop me into any point in space and time, could I accurately predict earth’s “position”?  I know position is an improper term.  Would it be possible to know exactly where to land so that you are at the same spot on the surface of Earth as when you “departed”?
