Could the universe expand forever even if there is no force (e.g., dark energy or eternal inflation) pushing it apart?

Matthew O'Dowd specifically and repeatedly states in the PBS Space Time video called, "Why the Universe Needs Dark Energy", that even without taking an expansionary field into account an under-dense Universe can, and probably will, expand forever...
I have read this elsewhere, as well...
How is this possible?
If the space of the universe is not curved outwards (hyperbolic curvature), and does not contain a cosmological constant (or eternal inflation, or dark energy, etc.), how can it not slow down and eventually stop?  And then start to shrink?
All theories of gravity claim it has infinite reach, correct?
I am deeply confused....
