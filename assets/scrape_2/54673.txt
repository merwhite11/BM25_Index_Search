The event horizon of a black hole

According to https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/black-holes-einstein-star-eaters', when something crosses the event horizon of a black hole "A person watching from the outside will not see you fall in. You will appear frozen at the holeâ€™s edge. Frozen for an infinite amount of time. Though technically not infinite. Nothing lasts forever, not even black holes." If so, why do we not see objects that are being sucked in?
