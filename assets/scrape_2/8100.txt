How does the Earth move in the sky as seen from the Moon?

I just want to be sure I am visualizing this correctly, because it seems odd. The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth but there are wobbles to its motion due to libration. So from a point on the surface of the near side of the Moon, the Earth would always be near the same place in the sky? It would describe a small circle or a side-to-side wobble over the course of a month, but never move far from that point?
That would seem very strange, like it was a gigantic stage prop or something. We are so conditioned that everything rises and sets (except for a few stars near the poles).
