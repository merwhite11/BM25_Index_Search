Control the behavior of a Black Hole

Is it possible to manipulate the size of a black hole or how a black hole behaves if scientists were able to synthesize hawking radiation on demand.  That is, if I could find a way to imitate hawking radiation in a missile would this missile decrease the size of the black hole I fire the missile at?  I am thinking provided I create enough hawking radiation it should have an effect on the black hole size once the missile detonates. That is if it is true that hawking radiation can make the black hole disappear as it does one the mini black holes who die because of hawking radiation.
