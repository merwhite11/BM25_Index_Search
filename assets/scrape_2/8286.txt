What determines the configuration of orbits in a binary system?

There are essentially two configurations of orbits a system with two bodies can have:
A configuration where the paths do not cross:

A configuation where the paths cross:

Note: Size of the bodies relative to one another is unimportant here.
What determines which of the two configurations a binary system will develop into?
