Fixed star-like light appears for a second or two - is there a way to find out what it was?

I saw what I can only describe as a fixed point of light, as bright as a shooting star, near Alpheratz for a second or two before disappearing. I am positive it wasn't a satellite nor a plane. There were no clouds in this part of the sky.
I saw this phenomenon on the 9th of September 2021 (yesterday night) at around 19.05 UTC time from near Toulon, south of France.
How can I go about finding out whether others saw it as well, and what it was?
