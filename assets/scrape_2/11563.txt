attractors of Mercury's spin-orbit relation

Mercury rotates at such a rate that the Sun appears to stand nearly still at perihelion, when the tide is strongest.
Is there a mechanism that tends to adjust the orbital eccentricity to improve the match – minimize the tidal torque (integrated over time), or some such?
If so, might there be other stable combinations of eccentricity and rotation coupling, other than the obvious 1:1?
EDIT: I'll rephrase, since most of you seem to think my question was something elementary like “how does Mercury rotate?” or “what the heck is tidal locking anyway?”.  I suppose it's not a bad heuristic to assume that the newcomer is completely ignorant, but I wish that assumption didn't override a literal reading of the question.
Each planet's orbital eccentricity varies over time.  Mercury's is now suspiciously near to what it would need to be for the sun to stand exactly still at perihelion.
So it's conceivable that in the dawn of time Mercury orbited at some arbitrary eccentricity and rotated at roughly 3/2, then resonance brought the rotation rate to exactly 3/2, and then something adjusted the eccentricity so that Mercury's long axis – the line of the lumps on which the tidal torque acts – tracks the sun more closely around perihelion.  (I wouldn't expect a perfect match at perihelion, because though tide is strongest then it doesn't vanish at other times!)
If that adjustment effect does happen, how does it work?
And if that happened for 3/2, could it also happen for other resonances, say 2/1 or 5/4?  For an odd denominator (other than 1) does the effect, whatever it is, behave differently (unless Mercury has a weird shape)?
