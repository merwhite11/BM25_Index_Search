How do you measure something that has already left the observable universe?

They say that the observable universe is only 5% of the entire equation. The rest of it consists of dark matter and energy. I believe that they are trying to find a way to see something that cannot be seen due to being outside of the observable universe, sort of like how galaxies redshift and slowly face away of out existence. 
tl;dr  does dark matter/energy increase every year?
What comes after red shift? Black? If so, then does that mean the universe is mostly black because 95% of matter has "Blackshifted"?
Did I post a question correctly?
