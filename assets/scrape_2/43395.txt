What to do in case of concentric circles that are not aligned with the cross after collimation (Picture inside)?

I have been collimating my newly bought first Newtonian telescope for a few days now, but I can't get the center of the circles to align with the intersection point of the spider's reflection. I have drawn a simple picture that illustrates what I see:

My question is, which mirror do I need to adjust, and in which way, in order to get the cross to align with the circles in the correct way.
Thanks in advance.
Edit:
If this is something that is not supposed to happen, then please tell me so that I would contact the seller. Thanks again.
