Have meteor showers been predicted for planets or solar-system bodies other than Earth? Have attempts been made to detect them?

Per the linked Q's and A's in Why do particles from a comet that result in meteor showers spread out mostly along the comet's orbit? and it's answer, meteor showers happen on Earth when it passes through the orbit of a comet. 
There are a lot of known comet orbits in the solar system, and some of them likely intersect the orbits of planets other than Earth.
Question: Have meteor showers been predicted for planets or solar-system bodies other than Earth? Has there been any attempt to look for experimental evidence of these meteor showers, perhaps using radio or optical observations from spacecraft near some of these bodies?
