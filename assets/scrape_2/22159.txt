Where can I still find solar film?

I, like many others, am excited to see the eclipse. I want to view the eclipse through my telescope, however, I don't have any solar safety equipment for solar viewing and I cannot find any online that I can get before the eclipse. Could anyone lead me to a reputable site where I could purchase solar (preferably mylar) film before the eclipse?
