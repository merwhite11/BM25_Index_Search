Is Spherical Astronomy by W. M. Smart a good book on positional/spherical astronomy?

I'm a math undergrad, but I'm really interested in learning positional astronomy; However, the only well-referenced textbook I've come up with is Spherical Astronomy by W. M. Smart. 
I would like to understand how suitable it is today. I have the 6th edition which seems to be the latest, but which was issued back in 1977. I know that a relatively old math text book, for example Apostol's Calculus (published in the 60's, if I'm not wrong), won't present too much trouble, but I'm a newcomer to astronomy, so I don't know if a book printed in 1977 is "up to date".
Given the case that there are better or more up-to-date books, are there other recommended texts for me to read as well or is this one a good choice?
