Can the CMB Cold Spot be explained by dark matter redshifting photons?

One explanation for the Cold Spot in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is that dark matter is redshifting CMB photons; see Fermilab's article "Scientists move a step closer to understanding the “cold spot” in the cosmic microwave background". But this dark matter would affect the orbital speeds of and within galaxies. Can current telescopes detect anomalously high orbital speeds in the direction of the CMB Cold Spot?
