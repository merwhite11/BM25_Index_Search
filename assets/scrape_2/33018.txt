What is the hottest thing in the universe?

Straight from my 7 year old to you, exactly what it says on the cover:

What is the hottest thing in the universe?

To make it Stack Exchange-friendly, I'll add the following caveats:

it should be bounded, as in an actual compact object, or class of objects, or part of an object
it should be observable
it should be an astronomical object, ie a Quark Gluon Plasma created by collisions at the Large Hadron Collider doesn't count.
