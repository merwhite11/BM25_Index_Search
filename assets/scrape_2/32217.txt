Discrepancy Between Results of Cosmological Observations & the Assertions of Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics requires a vacuum energy 40 orders of magnitude higher than that indicated by cosmological observations. Which side is most likely to be right,& when the truth is finally established beyond doubt,as one day it will be,won't this be extremely embarrassing for whichever group turns out to be wrong? Forty orders of magnitude is not a trivial error.
