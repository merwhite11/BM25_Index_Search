What is this "time travel" these popular blogs refer to?

I am getting confused by some "popular science" about time travel, such as 

or "Time Travel Is Real. Here Are the People and Spacecraft Who Have Done It":

It is indeed an interesting property of physics as we know it, and a great gift from the theory of relativity. It leads to useful perspectives on the nature of time as exemplified in the Twin Paradox example: When you travel for instance at a Lorentz factor of Î³ = 100 (99.995% the speed of light) for 10 years, time "dilates" to thousand years. For instance it has been proven experimentally that muons would "tick" slower, and therefore for a measure of time in seconds. Similarly, I would assume that extending this property at a macroscopic scale, your whole body would slow down... 
My question is to know if will you "live for a thousand years" (internet abounds of such statements as in this example forum and may be interpreted as such in the headlines above), or rather that during the 10 years of your travel (in your spaceship) and which would be measured as 1000 years in another frame of reference (the  earth), you would have aged by "only" 10 years in your spaceship - time "froze" during the travel.
