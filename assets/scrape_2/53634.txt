What are radio frequencies sensitive to in galaxies?

Apart from 21cm line studies, radio emissions as well as signatures of different radio sources, do radio frequencies help in the identification of a particular physical structure or presence of some certain specific elements/matter present in the galaxies?
If so, what are they?
