Do black holes emit dark matter as Hawking radiation?

When a star made from protons neutrons and electrons becomes a black hole that black hole can emit protons neutrons and electrons as Hawking radiation.
Dark matter is unusual matter: is there any evidence for unusual particles being radiated by black holes ( that may have swallowed dark matter) ?
If not perhaps black holes can't be made from dark matter because it doesn't have a particle antiparticle pairing that would enable the emission of  hawking radiation.
