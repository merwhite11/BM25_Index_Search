Interstellar reddening for Cepheids

How were interstellar reddening values for cepheid first calculated? 
I mean, other than using the derived equation to get extinction-corrected magnitude of Cepheids, I want to know how to drive them independently from measured raw data (maybe V, B-band colors, etc).
