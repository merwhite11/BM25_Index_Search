Following Meeus's Astronomical Algorithms for the Calculation of JD

For the Calculation of Julian Day (JD), I followed Chapter 7 of Meeus's Astronomical Algorithms. I could get the numbers mentioned in Example 7.a and 7.b.
On the basis of these methodology, proceeded to calculate JD for the Date 1992 October 13 at 0^h TD (Date mentioned in Example 25.a, Meeus). My Code provides JD for this Date as JD = 2448921.50.
However, for this Date (1992 October 13 00:00:00 UT), each of the URL:

https://quasar.as.utexas.edu/BillInfo/JulianDateCalc.html
https://neoprogrammics.com/perpetual_calendar_algorithms/jd_number/index.php

provide 2448921.50 as JDN (Julian Day Number).
However, each of the URL:

https://www.onlineconversion.com/julian_date.htm
https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/jdc/#/cd
https://planetcalc.com/503/
https://milwaukeeastro.org/variable/JD.asp

provide JD = 2448908.5 (Julian Day).
Now, the number 2448908.5 is described as JDE in Example 25.a of Meeus.
Kindly help with the:

Calculation of the correct JD corresponding to the Date 1992 October 13 at 0^h TD (Ex.25.a, Meeus).
How to obtain JDE from JD.

Thank you.
