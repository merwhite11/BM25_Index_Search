Does lack of atmosphere on the moon make earth-shine more, or less, bright?

The earth acts like a light-globe in the sky for half of the moon, the side that is facing the earth. In what way does lack of moon atmosphere influence earth-shine. Does it make earth-albedo brighter, or dimmer? Either way, do we know with how much? Put differently; would an atmosphere make it easier, or more difficult, to read a newspaper on the earth facing lunar surface, after sunset?
