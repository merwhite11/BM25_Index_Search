Is it possible that it actually takes an infinite amount of time to reach the apparent horizon of a black hole?

I know a black hole can absorb matter and maybe also release Hawking radiation. I think that according to the Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates, space is flowing and the apparent horizon is the region of space moving outward at the speed of light that will never fall into the black hole or escape. I know what matter the black hole absorbs later affects where the apparent horizon is not according to that coordinate system. However, maybe slightly different physical laws could end up with the following result. All the space outside the apparent horizon is skewed forward in time compared to the Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinate system and the amount it's skewed forward varies as the log of the reciprocal of the distance from the apparent horizon. I don't see how it's impossible that the laws would make it actually for real take an infinite amount of time for an object falling into a black hole to reach the apparent horizon. Maybe that would be a solution to the black hole information paradox. Maybe there's some sort of real actual physical truth out there that's true whether we define it to be or not we just don't know it and the truth of what's really going on means you cannot reasonably define it to take a finite amount of time to reach the apparent horizon, and the space beyond it doesn't exist whether you define it to or not.
