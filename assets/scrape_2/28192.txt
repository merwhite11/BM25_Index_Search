What is this elliptical orbit?

Most natural elliptical orbits are one sided as shown below from wiki.

What is an elliptical orbit where perigee and apogee are closer to being equal in distance than not? The object would have to skip off the atmosphere to maintain this orbit.

I have learned that this orbit would not be possible without spending energy and is not a stable orbit. Which makes this question off-topic no matter how I word it. I have flagged it for being off-topic.
