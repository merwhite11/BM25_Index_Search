Why is the discovery of merging neutron stars important?

I'm fairly certain people here will have heard about it, already, but apparently, two supernova leftovers clashed some 130 million years ago and some billion billion kilometres away ...
What I haven't heard yet, however, is why we should care.
I mean sure, it's an interesting phenomenon and measuring it can't have been easy.
But now that we've heard it ... what changes?
I'll admit it, I don't know particularly much about astronomy, but I'm curious:
What's the significance of having achieved this? Why does it matter whether or not we know?
