Is the shape of observable universe and shape of space same?

I have read that Euclidean space is considered as flat space and Minkowski space is flat space-time. So when we say our observable universe is flat are we saying that the space is flat or space-time is flat? I know the Planck data has proved the space to be flat but is it only space or space-time? Since in general relativity matter curves space-time and not just space.
