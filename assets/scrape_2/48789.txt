How do rocky planet break up? Would they fragment into "a gazillion" rocky pieces pieces, or crack open like an egg?

I remember seeing Star Wars, where Darth Vader shoots a superb laser (Death Star) to obliterate a populated planet, Alderaan (how inhumane).
The problem is, the planet cracked into a gazillion rocky pieces, like you would get if you dropped a marble ball from the top of the empire state building.
But, rocky planets (and perhaps other sufficiently large rocky bodies) have molten mantle. So I think, it should have cracked open like an egg, the crust shattering into a zillion pieces like an eggshell, with the viscous mantle liquid being sprayed across in space.
[Note that I am not referring to the firing of 'Jedha' (Rogue One) where a much reasonable planetary destruction was shown. I am referring to the original Star Wars, later dubbed The New Hope]
From Wikipedia's Terrestrial planet:

A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet, is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets accepted by the IAU are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Among astronomers who use the geophysical definition of a planet, two or three planetary-mass satellites – Earth's Moon, Io, and sometimes Europa – may also be considered terrestrial planets; and so may be the rocky protoplanet-asteroids Pallas and Vesta. The terms "terrestrial planet" and "telluric planet" are derived from Latin words for Earth (Terra and Tellus), as these planets are, in terms of structure, Earth-like.
