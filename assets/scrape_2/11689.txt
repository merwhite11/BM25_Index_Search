What causes the aurora of other planets to have different colors?

All I could come up with is it depends on the atmospheric composition of the planet as they will interact with the charged solar particles which might be true but is there is there a definite reason behind the different colors of aurorae on other worlds (Saturn's blue aurora for example)?
