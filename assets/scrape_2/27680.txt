Is it possible that the Universe is expanding due to additional Big Bang events?

Is it theoretically possible that the Universe is expanding due to additional Big Bang events that have occurred at the same location that the original Big Bang occurred at?
Perhaps there has been an ongoing series of smaller Big Bang events over the past 13.7 billion years, which although were not as massive in scale as the original Big Bang, have created a large amount of new space-time and new matter that has resulted in the Universe expanding.
