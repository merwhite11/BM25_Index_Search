Can magnetic monopoles only exist in a curved universe?

I’m trying to figure out rules for my Sci-fi universe and I need to know what type of universe, the universe needs to be for the existence of magnetic monopoles to exist. I read somewhere that the universe is generally believed to be flat and that that is why we can’t find magnetic monopoles. Yet magnetic monopoles are predicted by string theory and I very much like string theory and want to believe it is true. However I WANT my model of the universe to be 100% accurate so I will discard magnetic monopole if the real shape of the universe forbids it.
Basically is the universe flat and has no monopoles and for magnetic monopoles to exist; would the universe have to be curved?
