What is the easiest way to photograph stars during daylight hours?

This is probably going to be a bit of a weird one but here it goes.
I was looking to see what the easiest method would be to photograph the heavens during the day time in such a way that the stars are visible. Are there particular wavelengths or specific kinds of cameras that would be well suited for this task? Perferably on the more inexpensive side.
