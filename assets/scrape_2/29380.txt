Could a moon orbit an Earth size planet in such a way as to create a solar eclipse lasting for several weeks from start to finish?

Is it theoretically possible for a  moon to orbit a planet (let us say Earth size, mass and solar distance) in such a way as to create a planet-wide solar eclipse lasting several weeks?
These are my assumptions (some of them likely flawed) about the circumstances under which this might be possible:

To simplify the problem, let us assume that there is no planetary axial tilt and that the moon has an equatorial orbit.
The orbital speed of the moon would need to be quite slow in order to stay in position for long enough to create a graduating eclipse over several weeks.
In order to create a planet wide eclipse, the moon would need to be quite large and/or relatively close to the planet. Is this circumstance feasible if the mass of the object were low compared to its size?
How stable could the described relationship be?

Thank you for your interest and answers.
