Why is the Cosmic Microwave Background at the same distance no matter the direction we look?

I've read from different sources that:

The CMB is visible at a distance of 13.8 billion light years in all
directions from Earth, leading scientists to determine that this is
the true age of the Universe.

And that got me thinking, if this is true, there are 2 possible scenarios:

These are not really the true limits of the universe, but it's the farthest we can watch with our actual technology.
Or we happen to be the center of the universe, because we see the "beginning" of it at the same distance no matter the direction we see at (which I think this a dumb supposition)

So, why do we actually see the CMB at the same distance no matter what direction we look at?
