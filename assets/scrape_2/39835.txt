Does time dilate during night time when earth orbits around the sun?

Number of the solar middays (noon) = Number of the solar midnights (ALWAYS). The diagram (Top view but not to the scale) in the following link depicts the path traced by the earth in its orbit (either circular or elliptical) around the sun.

Both Midnight and Midday happen simultaneously and instantly. Any point on the outer circle represents solar midnight while on the inner circle solar noon. It's quite clear that the length (circumference) of the outer circle is greater than the length (circumference) of the inner circle. This means after the completion of one year, the occurrences of the Midnights are more the occurrences of Middays.
Earth not only rotates around its own axis but also revolves around the sun in its orbit however both axial and orbital motion of earth independent of each other. There is a possibility that the earth may glide w/o rotation for a short while and time dilate but such things never noticed either.
