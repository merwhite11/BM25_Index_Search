Why doesn't somebody update or improve the Messier catalogue?

I'm about moving from beginner to intermediate amateur astronomer and it strikes me that the Messier catalogue is still so widely used given it's well agreed imperfections.  There's the logical Caldwell of course, but why not combine them?  Give us, say, the 100 best objects incorporating the best of M and the best of C.  Any such thing?  If not, why not?
