Are there any planned future observations of TRAPPIST-1 and its planets?

The recent discovery of new planets around the star TRAPPIST-1 happened by observations from 7 ground-based telescopes, as well as the Spitzer Space Telescope. The team of astronomers responsible has noted that there are many relevant parameters which still have large uncertainties, including orbital information and planetary mass. There's also some excitement about possible atmospheric composition.
Are there any definite planned future observations of the system? I assume that at some point it will be targeted by the James Webb Space Telescope, but that won't launch for another year and a half, and it has plenty of other targets.
I'm not looking for detailed information - I know that cannot be easily gathered - but if there are any general mentions, like this one about the Subaru Telescope and Planet Nine, that would be fantastic.
