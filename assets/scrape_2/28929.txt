Is there any update on the Availability of Event Horizon Telescope Images?

There has been no news on the obvious public channels from the EHT project since last (Northern) summer. Does anyone have more information on when any results from the April 2017 run might be released? 
A secondary question is has the data from the April 2018 run been successfully gathered? I know they have to wait for Antarctic spring to ship the hard drives from the South pole, but that should have arrived a couple of months ago.
