360 degree equirectangular projection of all naked eye stars with precessional motion for simulating

For many years now I've been using Voyager sky simulator by Carinasoft. The projection selections are great, but Equirectangular doesn't seem to one one of them. Is there a program out there that does this? I cooked up an Excel sheet to do the coordinate conversions, and I can import these into Autocad if I have to, but it seems like there should be an off-the-shelf package to do this.      
For my current project I need to be able to show a 360 degree overview of changes due to precession from 3000-2000-1000 BC at a glance.  It may be my familiarity with the typical simple projection published for surveyors in a standard Ephemeris before the internet and GPS all but eliminated the demand for such publications.
