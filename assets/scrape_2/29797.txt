Can the moon's gravity influence be observed on the space station's orbit?

In browsing through Astronomy Stack Exchange, I came across this question about orbiting the moon (Is it possible to achieve a stable "lunarstationary" orbit around the moon?).  In further looking, I came across (Can I measure the moon's gravity?) which seems to indicate that with sensitive enough equipment, the moon's gravitational pull could be measured on earth.  This prompted me to wonder if the moon's gravitational pull can be observed on the Space Station's or geosynchronous satellite's orbital path?  And if so, if any compensation (either short-term or long-term) needs to be performed due to the moon's gravity.  I would think it to be relatively inconsequential, but am not sure, hence the question.
