What pole is closer to the galactic edge?

Suppose 2 spaceships leave from the earth's north and South Pole going straight up which one will exit the galaxy first (assume they have the same speed and are going in a totally straight line) ? Edge of the galaxy means absence of stars, this question refers to the up-down edge of this spiral galaxy.
The question is about the current distance from the earths poles to the edge (top/down) not to the galactic plane, as far as I understand after crossing the plane the nearest pole to the edge will be reversed.
