Why do neutron stars collide instead of just revolving around each other like planets revolve around the Sun?

We know about events like two neutron star colliding and resulting in a black hole, also collision of black holes, and collision of galaxies. But we never see a satellite such as a moon colliding with a planet, or a planet colliding with a star, or an artificial satellite colliding with Earth.
Can't such celestial bodies (like black holes or neutron stars) remain revolving each other? What makes them collide? Is anything other than gravity responsible for this?
