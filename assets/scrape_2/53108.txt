Does the Earth constantly lose mass?

The Moon is orbiting the Earth in a circular motion. To keep any object in a circular motion we need energy. Hence, does the Earth lose energy by pulling the Moon? In that case, does the Earth's gravity reduce constantly? If it does, then as gravity is proportional to mass, does the Earth lose mass as well?
