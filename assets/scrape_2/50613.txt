(Wikipedia) UY Scuti: variable apparent magnitude, non-variable absolute magnitude?

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UY_Scuti

Apparent magnitude (V)    8.29 - 10.56


Absolute magnitude (MV)   −6.2

UY Scuti, being a variable star, obviously has variable apparent magnitude; however why is the absolute magnitude a single value? Am I missing something i.e. does this have anything to do with the way UY Scuti is variable for instance being enshrouded in dust, or is it simply a Wikipedia error?
A quick check of other pages also shows some inconsistencies:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_Virginis  (same as UY Scuti)

Absolute magnitude (MV)   −3.0

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira (absolute magnitude flagged as variable)

Absolute magnitude (MV)   +0.99[7] (variable)
