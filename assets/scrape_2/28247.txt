When are the planets occulted by the sun?

There are numerous lists available of past and future planetary transits and occultations, but I can't find any that list transits behind the sun.
Do the planets in our solar system ever pass directly behind the sun, from Earth's perspective? Is there a special name for this kind of occultation, and is there a list of these events?
