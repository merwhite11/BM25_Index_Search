Does dark energy increase eccentricity in orbits of galaxies?

I came across this thesis dissertation which indicates that if a pair of orbiting galaxies are sufficiently far apart (with a sufficiently large orbital radius) then their orbits would change from circular to eccentric orbits by the "anti-gravity" effects of Dark Energy.
If that would happen, then, could these galaxies suffer tidal effects (such as tidal heating) due to the increasingly eccentricity of the orbits?
Would they eventually be unbounded forever or could there be some possibility where the tidal effects would re-circularize the orbit (at least for some part) before the orbit becomes extremely eccentric and they become unbound?
