Was the solar system flat before the planets formed? Or does the Kozai-Lidov mechanism flatten orbits after the gas giants form?

An astronomer living on Jupiter measures the orbits of the inner planets against Jupiter's ecliptic. Their inclinations are; Mercury 5.7 deg. Venus 2.1 deg. Earth 1.3 deg. Mars 0.6 deg.   It looks like Jupiter attracts smaller planets towards its own ecliptic.   If the original nebula was Oort cloud shaped, then the Sun and planets were assembled from components that had random orbital inclinations.  The "missing" momentum in the angular momentum problem was used up in the assembly of the solar system
