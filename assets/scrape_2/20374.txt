How were the first stars formed?

In class, we read a Scientific American article, "Cloudy with a Chance of Stars" that explained how the cores and the dust around them formed stars(he called them eggs for a chicken/egg analogy, where cores are eggs and I suppose novae are the chickens because the novae cause the core to start to collapse), but we don't know how the very first stars were actually formed. 
What are the leading hypotheses in this area, or am I misinterpreting the article? If you have a Scientific American account, here's the article I am referring to.
