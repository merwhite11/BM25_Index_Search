Could Hubble's Law simply be light's frequency decaying over time?

Is it proven that the frequency of EMR does not decay (at all, ever), and if not, could the observations that led to Hubble's Law simply be that the frequency of light decays over very large durations/distances?
If it does not decay innately simply due to duration, what about the various interactions it would have with particles / fields / "empty space" over very large distances; could these have a (reducing) effect on the frequency?
