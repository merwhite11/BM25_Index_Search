Photosphere is relatively transparent. Is that right?

This book, Astronomy in Minutes: 200 Key Concepts Explained in an Instant, by Giles Sparrow, says the photosphere is a visible surface at first, but after that, it says the Sun becomes cool and then transparent, so I am confused.

Our local star is a fiery ball of gas 1.39 million kilometres (863,000 miles) across. Powered by nuclear fusion, it has a three-layered internal structure (see pages 272 and 286). Its visible surface or 'photosphere' marks the zone where the Sun's hot gases grow sparse and cool enough to become transparent, at a temperature of around 5,500°C (9,900°F), but the Sun's sparse atmosphere or corona extends much further outwards.

I think the sentence highlighted in bold (not highlighted in the original) represents the definition of chromosphere... Is that right?
