What percentage of galaxies rotate with trailing arms?

I am looking for the percentage of galaxies that rotate with trailing arms. I know that only a small percentage of galaxies rotate with leading arms and would like to know whether there are any results that determine the percentage of spiral galaxies that rotate with tailing arms.
I am interested in publications in this topic.
Note:
So far I have found the following:

Land et. al (2008): "Determining the rotation
direction in this way is accurate for 96% of galaxies
(Pasha & Smirnov 1982)"
Pasha & Smirnov (1982)
Buta et al. (2003) 

Do you know of any newer publication on this question? More recent than Pasha & Smirnov (1982) where the sample is quite small?
