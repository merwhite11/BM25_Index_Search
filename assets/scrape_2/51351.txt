Earth's Collision

It is my understanding that the Earth is tilted because it was struck by another object about the size of Mars.

According to Newton's first law, the Earth should have continued to rotate along its meridian instead of stopping at 23 degrees. Why did it stop at 23 degrees?

Since the Earth rotates it should act like a huge gyroscope and return to its original axis. Why is that not the case?
