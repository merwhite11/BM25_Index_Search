What you would see in a wormhole?

Science fiction seems to depict the experience of traveling through wormholes (if possible of course) as seeing psychedelic colors or lines of light where stars once were (ie. 2001 or Contact). I wonder if theorists have any idea of what, if anything, the traveler would see.
This question may be subjective, but I know that there are theories about what an observer would see if traveling near the speed of light.
