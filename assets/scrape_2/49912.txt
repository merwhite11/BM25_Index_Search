What does it mean to be looking at something that is 13.5 billion years old?

Reading up on the James Webb telescope and how the images from it show us the universe as it was 13.5 billion years ago has made me wonder what does this mean?
Are we in essence viewing the past? And if the universe is always expanding does that mean there is more behind these images?
