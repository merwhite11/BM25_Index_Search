Can a supernova or a close passing star create a transient sun gravity focus "habitable zone"?

This question was inspired by the previous question Would a black hole passing next to a star create a deadly focal point due to gravitational lensing?. I understand, as gravity also acts on light, that any massive object acts as a sort of lens. In the case of our sun, the focal distance starts about 550au, and there are several proposals to send probes there, given we could use the sun as a lens for a huge "telescope". See for example, Hesperides: Solar/nuclear missions to the Sun×³s inner gravity focus and First Stop on the Interstellar Journey:The Solar Gravity Lens Focus.
So I wonder, could the intensity of this effect be enough to melt water and create a sort of habitable zone (perhaps more of a habitable spot) in the opposite direction of a supernova as seen from the sun, by concentrating its light rays. I put the expression habitable zone inside quotes in the title because I don't think that sort of environment would be actually be habitable, as ionizing radiation of the supernova would be concentrated as well, so that would be a extreme environment. Yet, I can think of some interesting observable effects. I think that "habitable spot" would be tiny, but if we were lucky enough for a cometary nucleus pass through it just at the right time, perhapts it could develop a coma that we would be able to observe from Earth. Countless supernovas happened since solar system formation, so I would not be surprised if outer solar system contains a couple remnants of objects roasted this way.
The light of a near passing star would be concentrated too, but I think the effect would be weaker when compared with what a supernova like, say, SN 1054 can achieve.
