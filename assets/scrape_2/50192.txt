I saw a short-lived brightening and fading of a light in the sky. Was that a star imploding, exploding or going super-nova?

I was looking over the north-eastern skyline from a west coast location and notice something very bright for well over about 10 or 15 seconds, and then it faded completely. I didn't notice it before and I don't own any equipment that can see that far away but it looked like a star got really bright and then pulled into itself. Is it possible that I just watched a star go super-nova?
