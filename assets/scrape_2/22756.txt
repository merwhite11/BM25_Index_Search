What should I read next after Neil deGrasse Tysons "Astrophysics for people in a hurry"?

I really liked the clever way the author explained stuff in this book but I already understood most of it. Neil himself states in the book that if you are not in a hurry and want to know more about the topic the are plenty of bigger books you can look into. So my question is: what is sort of a next step after this book on this topic (astronomy, astrophysics)? 
Thanks.
