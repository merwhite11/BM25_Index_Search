What does a + (plus) mean in stellar classification?

I've noticed some stellar classifications might look like this:

A0IV+G:  (HD 70003)
F3IV+F0IV  (HD 82434)
K0-1III+A4V+A  (HD 39547)
G7IIIa+F9IV  (HD 130458)
S6+/1e  (HD 187796)

I assume it means it's a binary (or triple, etc) star system, but cannot find any literature to back this up.
Resources I've looked at:

The Spectra of Stars (and Brown Dwarfs)
Stellar Classification
Star Type
Spectral Type
Spectral Class
Morgan-Keenan Luminosity Class
The classification of stellar spectra
The Classification of Stellar Spectra
Studies of multiple stellar systems

(There are more, but this list is getting a bit ridiculous.)

What does the plus actually mean?

EDIT: doing further research, it would appear as though you get multiple types of plusses, too: 
‚Å∫ (superscript) - Increase in strength / magnitude? 
+ (regular) - A sibling star?
Where it potentially gets a bit confusing is that downloadable star catalogs appear to present both as regular +, meaning you'd need to read it contextually.
