Locate planets and stars for beginners

I am a beginner in astronomy. In fact, I just bought my first refractor telescope with 60 mm aperture and 600 focal lengths with 4mm, 12.5mm and 20 mm eyepiece and 3x barlow.
Could I get info on android app or book where I can see real-time position of planets and other amazing celestial bodies, I am in the northern hemisphere.
