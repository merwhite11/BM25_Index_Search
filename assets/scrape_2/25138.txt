Venusian polar surface temperatures

I've stumbled across several articles about how the Venusian polar high atmosphere is really cold. What these articles appear to fail to specify is what the surface temperatures of the poles are. I am interested in knowing the polar surface temperatures. I would think that convection would lower the polar surface temperature to lower amounts, but I don't know a lot about Venus's poles to say anything about this.
