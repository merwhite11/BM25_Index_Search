Difference in the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements

I understand from this Wikipedia page about baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). I can also see that BAO measurements were first detected using luminous red galaxy samples. 
Now, many papers use galaxy clusters to measure the BAO signal. What is the advantage/difference between using galaxy samples and galaxy cluster samples to measure the BAO?
EDIT:
Here are some of the papers using galaxy clusters for BAO detection.
