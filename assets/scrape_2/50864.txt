What is the difference between a solar eclipse seen from Earth, the Moon, and from 1 one of Jupiter's Galilean moons (ex. Io)?

A solar eclipse viewed from Earth reveals the sun's corona and you can only see the brightest stars from Earth.

However a solar eclipse viewed from the moon would show the red ring around Earth.

I have not seen an image / video of what a solar eclipse would look like on one of Jupiter's Galilean moons.
How long would an eclipse last on these objects? How dark would it get? Which stars / planets would be visible with the naked eye? Could you still see the sun's corona during these eclipses?
