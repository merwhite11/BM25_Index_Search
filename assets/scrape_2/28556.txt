Is there enough light to grow plants in the ocean of Europa?

What is the underwater temperature of Europa?
I know Jupiter emits infrared light but does it emit any light able to support plant life of any type on near by Moons? Can under water volcanic activity of Europa produce enough light to support plant life?
