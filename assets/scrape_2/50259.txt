Star formation - Is it just gas accumulation or does dust also play a role?

Inspired by the question, Are heavy elements equally distributed throughout the Solar System?, with a little further inspiration from this one as well, Star formation analogy, particularly the answer by David Hammen, where he states "... oftentimes needs a little help from an external disturbance such as a passing star or a supernova shock".
Is the formation of a star just about the concentrated accumulation of hydrogen gas and its self ignition, with the assistance of an external disturbance, or does cosmic dust have a role in producing a heavy core that can act as a gravitational attractor drawing in hydrogen gas?
