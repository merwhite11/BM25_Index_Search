Are there any Hubble images of Polymele available?

Lucy is a spacecraft that will visit trojan asteroids, among which there is the asteroid Polymele. Before doing an occultation observing campaign for the asteroid Polymele in October 2021, the Lucy team used Hubble data to constrain the orbit of Polymele. Are the Hubble pictures of Polymele publicly available?
(I expect that you can't see much more than a couple pixels, but I'd still be curious to see the image)
