A mysterious signal at 14.2054 ÂµHz

After the stellar triple system PSR J0337+1715 was discovered a few years ago, I was interested in whether the GW could be detected here. From the known orbit times it follows that the GW frequency 14.2054e-6 Hz would have to be phase modulated with f_mod=1/(327 days). It's easy to build a software defined receiver for these frequency, the problem is the antenna. The LIGO interferometers cannot receive such low frequencies; LISA does not yet exist. So I used air pressure as an "antenna" because earthquakes don't interfere. Surprisingly, I discovered a weak signal with the characteristics described above exactly at the target frequency. Additionally it is phase-modulated with f_2=1/(365 days). Could this be a GW? It fits the triple system.
