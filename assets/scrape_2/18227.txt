Is there a spectrum of polarization? Does polarization vary depending on wavelength, from one and the same source?

Is it possible, and does it occur naturally, that the light from the same source is simultaneously polarized differently at different wavelengths? Light can be polarized by interstellar magnetic fields. Could it polarize light of different wavelengths differently? Does a pair of polarized sunglasses polarize radio waves and UV in the same way as visible light?
