Tallest cliffs, by falling duration

If you threw something over a certain cliff on a moon of Uranus, it would take over ten minutes to hit bottom.
By this measure, local fall time rather than absolute height, what are the near contenders to the prize for tallest cliff on a body in hydrostatic equilibrium in the solar system?  Throwing the object horizontally at a few meters per second is ok.  Not ok is throwing it beyond a tiny body's Hill sphere.  Cliffs, not spheres.
Simplifying assumptions about atmospheres and exospheres are ok.
