Calculating the separation of binary stars

I'm struggling with the following problem:
An eclipsing binary has period 0.10 years and each component has speed in its orbit of 19AU per year (or 90km/s) Assuming both stars have the same mass and that their orbits are circular, calculate their separation in AU and their masses relative to the Sun.
I've tried solving using Newton's laws of motion and gravity and Kepler's 3rd law, but can't seem to get the expressions I need for the separation and relative masses.
