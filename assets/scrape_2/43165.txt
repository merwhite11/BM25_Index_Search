What’s an Earth-Sun-Moon eclipse called?

I understand we would all die and this is a common “think about your question before you ask it” thing in high school, but what would we call an eclipse where the Sun gets in between Earth and the Moon?
Solar eclipse comes from Latin solaris, lunar from lunaris, and Terran eclipse (terra) seems like it’s already one of those two from the Moon’s perspective.
Orbital? Terrar? Orbar? Tellar?
