What would be the electric potential and the energy produced in a cable connecting two electronic devices on the magnetic poles of the earth?

The earth is a large magnet moving in the magnetic field of another large magnet the sun.
And if we connect the two poles of the earth by a cable there would be energy and an electric potential in this cable by electromagnetic induction no?
Since there are anomalies observed in the magnetic field of the earth and given the number of electrons and protons involved how much energy can be produced from this power cable?
Here is a picture of the principle of producing energy:
