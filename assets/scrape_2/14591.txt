Is it possible that Titan is a kuiper object captured by Saturn?

I think Titan may be just captured by Saturn, not formed with Saturn together, because:

It has so much nitrogen and methane, which is similar to Pluto and Triton
Except Titan, other moons of Saturn are very small, which other moons may be ejected by Titan during capturing process, similar to Triton and Neptune
According to Nice model, Neptune swapped position with Uranus, while Saturn pulled Jupiter away from the Sun, so I think the orbit of Neptune and Saturn is quite close at past, so if Neptune can capture kuiper object, Saturn also can

Is it possible that Titan was a Kuiper object?
