Would Bussard Ramjets work in other places in or near the galaxy?

Sorry if this this doesn't really fit this forum, but WorldBuilding does not like questions like these. I cannot find the minimum density of hydrogen a Bussard ramjet (an interstellar ship propelled by hydrogen collected from the interstellar medium) needs to work, or the densities of these certain areas(galactic core, thicker arms, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, Magellanic Bridge, and the Magellanic stream, and intergalactic space). I am interested if this is a viable mode of transportation in different parts of the universe relatively near to us.
