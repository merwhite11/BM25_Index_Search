What to observe with a remote telescope close to sunrise time?

I have an access to a remote telescope at 05.15-05.45 am at Hawaii time. The sun rises at 06.15 am. I will use this telescope for educational purposes for high school students. I wonder 30 mins is enough to make a variable star observation or a spectroscopic measurement.  
The specs of the telescope could be found on https://lco.global/observatory/2m/
