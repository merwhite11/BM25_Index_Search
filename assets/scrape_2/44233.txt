How do astronomers know that distant galaxies aren't actually nearby star clusters?

When reading about the recent release of data from the Dark Energy Survey, and the 'pictures' of well over 200 million distant galaxies, I got to wondering:
How can they know that a small, faint, distant smudge is not, in fact, a much-less-distant globular cluster of stars?
