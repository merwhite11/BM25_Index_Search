Are the Leonid meteor storms a thing of the past?

According to the Wikipedia article on the Leonids, "a close encounter with Jupiter is expected to perturb the comet's path, and many streams, making storms of historic magnitude unlikely for many decades". Does this mean there will not be another incidence of the famous storms which spawned thousands or tens of thousands of meteors per hour within our lifetimes? Or will the 33 year periodicity reestablish itself?
