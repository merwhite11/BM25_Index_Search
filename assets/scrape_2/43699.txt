Spotting the booster rocket of the Chinese space station?

SpaceWeather.com's newsletter states

Sky watchers are reporting two new objects in the night sky: China's new space station and an out-of-control booster rocket that helped launch it. The tumbling booster is flashing brighter than some of the brightest stars in the sky.

My usual star-gazing app does not have the rocket booster in its database (yet), and I did not manage to spot it yet (from cloudy central Europe). Is there an official name for the object? Could somebody help me how to find it in the remaining 2 days while it is still in orbit around Earth? Or maybe somebody could even share a picture or two?
Bonus question: Maybe somebody could also enlighten me in how far any single-use booster-rocket could be in-control after it ejected its payload? Wasn't that the default for many years? Also: Now that we can observe the rocket we know the trajectory and could also forecast when it will crash and where, aren't we?
