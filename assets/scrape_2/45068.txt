Could observation of GL or other image phenomena from system of 2 merging massive dense objects and of GW caused by their merge be connected?

What is the probability to observe gravitational lensing (or any other image related phenomena) from the pair of black holes (or pair of neutron stars or black hole - neutron star) which are about to merge and then catching the subsequent gravitational wave produced at their merge?
I am also interested to find out via answers how the observation of the gravitational lensing (or any other image related phenomena), caused by the two sufficiently massive objects (itemized above), which are in the process of merging, be distinguished from similar by its nature phenomenon caused by the single "stable state" object (again itemized above).
