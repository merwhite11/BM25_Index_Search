Time and space travel as applied to expanding space and the ratio of/between time and distance

If a place is 500 light years away, then I set out to this place, then is it true to say that, the place which I set out from, will be 750 light years away from my destination, once I have reached it?
I am thinking of expanding space, as the reason for the additional distance possibly accumulated. Also to be considered for other galaxies separate from our own. Also what would be the estimated increase in the distance would it be half as much, or a quarter or third?
If the speed of light is 186 282 miles per second, then what would be the distance of expansion accumulated which occurred within the time it would take for a craft traveling at this speed to reach a galaxy beyond ours, or even a distance of 500 light years away, obviously there are innumerable distances of light years which could be applied to this calculation.
