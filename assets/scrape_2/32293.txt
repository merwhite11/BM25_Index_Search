How "fast" do astronomical events occur?

I've seen quite a few news about astronomy but I'm not deep into knowing how it works or how people observe it. It got me thinking: if I want to watch a supernova for example, how long will I have to look for it to watch the whole "event"? Or events like NASA "seeing something coming out of a black hole", were they "looking" at the blackhole when something came out really quickly or did they observe it for months? Or maybe the birth of a blackhole?
Now, I do know black holes that quite a few trillion of years to vanish, I'm just curious how much time does it take for astronomers to observe such events.
