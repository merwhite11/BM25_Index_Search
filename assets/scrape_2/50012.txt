How and when will Sirius migrating towards the Sun trigger the movement of Kuiper belt objects into the solar system?

Currently the Sirius binary star system is moving towards the Sun at 5.5km/s for roughly the next 60 thousand years or so. At the end of those years it will be 7.8 light years away from the Sun and roughly 6.8 light years away from the Kuiper belt with a magnitude of 1.64.
So at what point will these two massive stellar objects (in addition to objects orbiting around them adding to their masses too) start to affect the Kuiper belt and trigger frozen objects to start moving through the solar system and potentially cause another extinction level event? What effect do these objects (Sirius A. and B.) have on the Kuiper belt? Will they begin to push and pull on all the other objects in the Kuiper belt and cause them to collide and send them on unknown trajectories? Will it be during the next 60 thousands years that the Sirius binary system is advancing towards the Sun?
