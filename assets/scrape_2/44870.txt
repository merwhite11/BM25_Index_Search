What if wormholes were created when a black hole and white hole collide?

Scientists have discovered black holes, white holes and wormholes but I am still unsure how they came to life. Did the black holes collide with the white hole causing a mixture of both or is there something else I need to know. I know that wormholes create a path where you can travel from one side of the universe to the other. I just want to know how they came about.
