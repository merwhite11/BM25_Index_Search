Which of the following statements about gravitational waves are true?

a) The emission of gravitational waves from merging black holes is predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. 
b) The first direct detection of gravitational waves, announced in 2016, came from the LIGO observatory. 
c) Two orbiting neutron stars or black holes will gradually spiral toward each other as a result of energy being carried away by gravitational waves. 
d) The emission of gravitational waves from merging black holes is predicted by Newton's universal law of gravitation. 
e) Although gravitational waves are an important theoretical prediction, we do not yet have any observational evidence that they  exist.
f) Scientists seek to detect gravitational waves by using powerful gamma-ray telescopes.
I personally think e is false because LIGO detected the gravitational wave already. For others, I think they are alright. But I am not sure if I missed anything. Could someone give any suggestion?
