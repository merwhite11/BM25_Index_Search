How much of a molecular cloud can end up as "starstuff"?

Stars form within molecular clouds. These clouds can be up to 6 millions solar masses. When the cloud collapses into stars, is it possible to know a rough figure for how much of this material actually turns into stars? 1%? 99%?
Do larger clouds tend to be more mass-efficient in star formation than smaller ones?
