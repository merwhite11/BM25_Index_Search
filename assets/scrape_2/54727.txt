Death of a Black Hole â‰  Rebirth?

So we all know that Stephen Hawking proved that Black Holes do evaporate overtime through hawking radiation. But that energy is released in very discrete amounts and there will be a time in the universe when there would not be any stars left and we would only have black holes. And here is where my question comes in: After we see the blackhole era of the universe won't we see a small blackhole that evaporates fast and all of the energy released can form stars or more?
