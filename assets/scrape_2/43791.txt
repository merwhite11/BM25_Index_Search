Any examples of a gas object temperature from Doppler broadening along one axis turning out to be wrong because velocity spread was not isotropic?

Discussions under Mass of the stellar cluster (not the whole galaxy) lead me to mention that when an actual temperature is inferred from a Doppler-broadened line profile (rather than just a linewidth expressed as an effective temperature), we assume that the Maxwell-Boltzoman velocity distribution in the directions perpendicular to the line of sight is the same as that the one measured along the line of sight.
Have there been any examples of this kind of assumption turning out to be invalid later? Some situation where the distribution of velocities turned out to be substantially anisotropic?
I'm not asking for examples of anisotropic velocity distributions, I'm asking for a case where it seemed like a good assumption at the time, but later it turned out something more interesting was going on and the line-of-sight Doppler width did not represent the spread in perpendicular velocities.
