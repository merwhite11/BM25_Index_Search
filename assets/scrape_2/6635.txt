Is Earth's orbital eccentricity enough to cause even minor seasons, without axial tilt?

I was reading the answers to this question about an exoplanet having seasons without axial tilt, and several responders mention that orbital eccentricity could cause a similar effect, but that the orbit would need to be "very eccentric," as opposed to Earth's, which is "very close to circular."
If the Earth had no axial tilt at all, would its eccentricity be high enough to have any discernible effect for the inhabitants?  Even if it didn't cause major shifts in temperature, would it be enough for pre-scientific people to track the passing of years?
