How can a singularity rotate?

So I've heard that all black holes that have been observed rotate to some degree. But if it has zero radius, how is it even possible for the black hole itself to be spinning? Or is it just all the junk inside the event horizon that's rotating? 
Maybe it spins with infinite angular velocity and a finite angular momentum? Please explain how this works.
