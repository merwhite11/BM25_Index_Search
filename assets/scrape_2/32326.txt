Telescope was working and now it's not

We have a Celestron 70AZ 70mm f/10 refractor that has been working perfectly. Our children knocked it over the other day, and now when we try to view the moon, it fills the lens as a giant, blurry ball of light. Have they knocked something loose? We tried adjusting the different focus knobs but I am worried it's messed up and I have zero clue how to fix this, diagnose it or even where to go to get it looked at.
