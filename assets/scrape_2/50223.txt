Are there any probabilistic models for the likelihood of finding a rogue planet closer to us than Proxima Centauri?

There are some articles that claim there could be more rogue planets than stars in our galaxy such as this one.
Now if this were true one might expect that there is a rogue planet closer to the earth than the star Proxima Centauri. Have any models been built regarding the probability of this? And/or perhaps a curve of mass of rogue object, distance from Earth, and probability?
