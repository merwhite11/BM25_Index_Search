Why the Sun is white if it is G2?

I know it's a simple question, but even I progressed in astronomy, I always had this question. So, I know the Sun, in the MK classification system, it's G2: yellow. But I also know the sun, in visible spectrum, is white! But when I search for NASA photos of Sun in this spectrum, I find some photos with the Sun being yellow, and others white, with some of them being even orange! What is happening here? Is something incorrect?
