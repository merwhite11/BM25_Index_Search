How to find the distance between stars

I wanted to calculate the distance between the end points of the Orion's belt (Alnitak and Mintaka).
I searched in the internet and I found out their angular separation to be 2.736Â°.
Then I searched for the actual distances of the two stars from Earth; and it turned to be 1260 light years for Alnitak and 1200 light years for Mintaka.
Then I used the cosines law to find the actual distance between the two stars. I reached 84 light years as the answer.
Questions:

Is the cosines law a good way to find the actual distance between two celestial objects in such far distances?
Is there another way to find the actual distance between two celestial objects?
Can we find the actual distance between two celestial bodies if we don't know the angular distance between them?
