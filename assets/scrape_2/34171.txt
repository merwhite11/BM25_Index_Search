How can I use my current camera whose zoom lens can't be removed behind an f/6 refractor for as an astrophotography?

I am looking at an Astrotech AT60ED (60 mm f/6 with a field flattener) and a Digi-Kit telescope adapter to do astrophotography, mainly deep-sky and I'm wondering if I can use my current Panasonic DMC-FZ50 Type CCD camera body.
The problem is that it has a zoom lens that can't be detached which is why I am worried.
