How does the dense atmosphere of Venus affect the planet's rotation?

Reading through questions about my favourite planet, Venus, I came across this answer to the question What is the current accepted theory as to why Venus has a slow retrograde rotation?, specifically where the answer suggests one of the possible reasons for the slow retrograde motion as being

The spin slowed to a standstill and then reversed, caused by the sun's gravity, the dense atmosphere and friction between core and mantle

Based on a fairly recent study published in the Nature article "The four final rotation states of Venus (Alexandre C. M. Correia & Jacques Laskar, 2001).
Given the relatively high density of the Venusian atmosphere, this leads to the question:
