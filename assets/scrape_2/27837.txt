Do astronomers have an established, systematic way for saying what does or doesn't orbit what? (e.g. "Mars orbits Earth")

A recent comment

An object far enough away can certainly orbit the Moon and the Earth (and the Sun) -- Mars, for instance does this. An object in the Earth-Moon L2 is also orbiting both the Earth and the Moon.

A recent comment about that comment:

according to your way of thinking all solar system bodies orbit Mercury, except the Sun, which is just silly. Or does the Sun in fact orbit Mercury as well? I think your use of the word orbit is not workable, nor shared by almost anyone else.

So I'd like to ask if astronomers have an established, systematic way for saying what does or doesn't orbit what within the solar system, and if so, a link to point to in the future would be greatly appreciated!
