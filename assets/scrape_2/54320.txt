Large dataset of galaxies redshift, mass, and metallicity?

I'm curious if there is a standard dataset for redshift-mass or redshift-metallicity like there is for redshift-distance with Pantheon+SH0ES.

There is NED, which has millions of redshifts, but mass and metallicity aren't part of its results.

It'd be nice to have 10's of thousands (if not more) data points available with one or both of those properties. Does such a project exist?
