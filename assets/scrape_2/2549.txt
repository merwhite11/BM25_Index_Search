Dark Flow: statistical limits on existence

Dark Flow has been thrown around as a term a lot lately, especially with the latest Planck results. 
New Scientist reported last year that it was now statistically improbable, but the paper by Atrio Barandela mentioned in the article places doubt on the statistical significance of the dipole measurement by the Planck team.
I'd like to know what observational limits lie on it's existence as a physical phenomena (giant attractor/multiverse/new region of spacetime/other weirdness) and not just a statistical anomaly in the overall matter distribution, I.e. what future observations could prove or disprove this theory?
