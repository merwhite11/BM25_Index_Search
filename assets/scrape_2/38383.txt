360 degree image of the whole sky

I look for an image that I know exists.
It is an image showing the whole sky, showing all stars and galaxies bright enough to be visible at the resolution, projected to the same shape that is commonly used for the microwave background / CMB.
I am sure the image is well known and has a name.
Can you give a reference to it?
