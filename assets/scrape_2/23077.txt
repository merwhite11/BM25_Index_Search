Astrodynamic Canonical Units

Maybe this is more appropriate for the Physics or Maths, but anyway.
I am struggling with applying Canonical units with formulas. I am struggling specifically with how they are used, am I to convert all the time? Use the whole numbers?
An example is a a simple velocity of a circular orbit: v= SQRT Mu/r
r  =2DU (12,756.23KM)
Mu =1DU3/TU3 (3.9860KM3/s2)

v = 4.5641KM/S or 0.707DU 

In order to convert it back to DU I had to use a percentage calculator (I'm bad at fractions). Is there a simpler way of converting back and forth?
