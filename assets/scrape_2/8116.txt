Red shifting galaxies

I am an amateur astronomer please correct if any of my understandings are wrong. We all know that from the Hubble's ultra deep field image the most distant galaxies which were created shortly after big bang looked to be red shifted. This is because of the process of expansion of the universe these lights are reached its highest visible wavelength. So in near future (in terms of astronomy) the galaxies which appears to be normal today become red shifted?  and those are already appeared as red shifted become invisible? If it become invisible still can we see it through infrared telescopes right?
