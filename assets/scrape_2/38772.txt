How are younger objects outside our observable universe when the older CMB is an observer's temporal "edge"?

We know the observable universe is limited to objects whose light has had time to reach us and that an observer very far away will see a slightly different (assuming cosmological principle) observable universe with a slightly different (yet similar) CMB. We know that the CMB (cosmic microwave background or surface of last scattering) was released everywhere in the universe at once and is considered one of the earliest images of the universe. If objects (galaxies, stars et.) created after the CMB are outside our observable universe, why is the CMB our temporal edge? In other words, how are younger objects outside the older CMB? I understand that the universe is expanding, but wouldn't the CMB get redshifted then too?
