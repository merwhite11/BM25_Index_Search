Yellow object between δ Ori and η Ori

Can someone perhaps assist me in identifying the yellow object between δ Ori and η Ori? I took an image of this object, but I can't identify it.
It can be seen on the image below, hosted on the Eagle Creek Obs. site. (http://www.eaglecreekobservatory.org/eco/doubles/images/ori.gif)
It's the orange object on the constellation line between 28 and 34.
