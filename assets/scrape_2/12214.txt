What is meant by matter distribution?

Frustratingly, I find this could be a very simplistic question and may leave me feeling a little stupid for asking it. But I have to ask this.
My lecturer keeps refering to "matter distributions" for various rotation cases, e.g., Keplerian rotation, solid body rotation, flat rotation etc etc. 
I was wondering if anyone knew exactly what this term means, or the specifics for each case?
