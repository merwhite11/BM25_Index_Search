What type of camera instruments are used to record optical images in space telescopes like HUBBLE & JWST.?

I am just curious about photos taken by space telescopes 
What kind of type of camera systems are used in space telescopes like HUBBLE and JWST? 
Are those cameras systems specially built for that purpose? 
Is there a significant difference between cameras we use and of those? 
What type of lenses are used?
