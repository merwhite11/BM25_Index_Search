Interstellar Dust properties

While practicing for an upcoming examination, I ran into this problem:

Which of the following best describes dust grains in the interstellar medium:

They are a few hundred nanometers in size (size of optical light).
They are much larger than regular dust.
They are primarily composed of helium and hydrogen.
They emit large amounts of blue light.


I did some research and discovered that they scatter blue light, their size ranges form $1 \ldots 100 {\rm \mu m}$ while regular dust is about $1 \ldots 100 \mu{\rm m}$. Also, interstellar medium is composed of helium and hydrogen but that doesn't mean the same about dust. My guess: It is the first answer.
Is this correct? Any assistance much appreciated.
