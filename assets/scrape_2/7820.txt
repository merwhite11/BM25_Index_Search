Companion Sun the cause of comet impacts with Earth

On television, I heard a scientist who believes that our Sun has a companion (brown dwarf) Sun, that is responsible for comets destroying life here on Earth every 26 million years. He proposed the theory that when this companion Sun travels through the Ort Cloud, every 26 million years, it brings billions of Comets with it into our Solar System and inevitably one crashes into the Earth. Any thoughts on this?
