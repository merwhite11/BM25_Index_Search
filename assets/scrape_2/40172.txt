Does a gravitational lens around a body look 3-dimensional?

Suppose we approach a neutron star or a stellar black hole close enough, is the gravitational lens around it 3-dimensional (like a tunnel) or is it 2-dimensional? It's 3-dimensional as if you entered a spacetime tunnel, isn't it? If you entered the tunnel, sidewards you'd see the firmament distorted too, right?
