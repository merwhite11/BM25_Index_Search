Is the discovery of a "mass gap" black hole by this tiny telescope just plain luck/serendipity or could it be the first of many similar discoveries?

The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope is a pair of modest lenses with high quality medium format CCDs attached sitting on oversized mounts in Arizona and Sutherland.
These very modest instruments have discovered several exoplanets (by choosing a niche magnitude range) and have now seemed to have discovered a particularly interesting 3 $M_{\odot}$ black hole + red giant binary.

Question: Is the discovery of this "mass gap" black hole by this tiny telescope just plain luck or serendipity, or could this be the first of many similar discoveries? How likely is it that there are more nearby "mass gap black holes" that just got missed due to the parameter space sampled by time domain based surveys?

Figure 13. The right panels show the template subtracted H (red dot-dashed), H (blue dashed) and Ca i 6439 (black) line profiles at various orbital
configurations illustrated in the left panels. The size of the compact object is simply chosen to make it easily visible.
