Do the newly-created deuterons in our Sun release any photons? In addition to a positron and an electron neutrino?

Perhaps this is a nuclear physics question, but....
When two colliding protons deep inside our Sun finally turn into a deuterium nucleus or deutron (after approximately ten octillion chances, on average, from what I've heard) they of course release the standard beta-plus decay products of a positron and an electron neutrino...
Does the newly-formed deuteron then automatically release a photon?  Is it a gamma-decay photon, i.e. a gamma ray?  Or does its energy vary, depending on the energy shared with the neutrino and the positron...

P.S.: Less important secondary question... How often do two protons join up and they BOTH become neutrons?  And then decay, putting them back at square one?  Every ten octillion Ã— ten octillion collisions, or 10^56?
