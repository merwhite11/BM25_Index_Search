Observation of Gravitional waves by LIGO from binary black hole merger

I read the paper "Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger"
https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102
I tried to understand all the graphs and data observed in the paper.
I am curious how these data and graphs conclude that the gravitational waves observed were because of binary black holes merger? Also what calculations and equations led to the same?
Also how will the calculations and equations look if neutron stars were there instead of black hole in the same merger?
(graphs and data can be seen in the observation section in the paper)
