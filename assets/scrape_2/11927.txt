Less stars in the night, compared to 15-20 years back

I am not sure if my question is true or not. But this is what I observe regularly. When I was young and when I look at the sky, there were too many many stars were there. But now, from few months I'm observing the sky (by eyes, not any telescope), I see very few stars. Perhaps, countable.
Is it because:

Stars are dead? (Not all) As I read somewhere, by the time you see the star, it would have been dead. Because, the light would've traveled so many years to reach earth. By the time, star would have completed 'X' light years and it is dead by now?
Current position of the earth in galaxy: As I read, the earth will not always traverse in the same path around the sun. So the current view from the earth to the sky, may not have any star? (This is my guess/imagination, I'm not sure)
Is it because of the city light/ pollution?

PS: Please be easy. May be the question is broad or simple, just want to know the brief answer and if its complete explanatory, I'm happy for that.
