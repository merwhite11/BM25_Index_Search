What does it mean that the radial coordinate becomes the time coordinate behind the horizon?

The time and radial co√∂rdinate change are exchanged with one another behind the black hole horizon. So even stating that it's happening behind the horizon is misleading. There is, as a figure of speech, an ocean of time after the horizon. Yesterday, ten years ago, hundred years ago, they're all in there. From the outside, all stuff seems to freeze on the horizon, except the initial stuff that's in the hole, although that is cut off by the horizon as there is no inside anymore, after the formation. Seen from far away, that is.
But now I fall in. Can I can meet a particle that fell in hundred years ago, according to someone very far away? And will I be radiated away shortly after in the form of Hawking radiation (or better, information about my particles)?
