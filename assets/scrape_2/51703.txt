Does a planets mass affect its gravitational pull? Let's say earth increased or decreased in mass could that theoretically affect gravity?

This was a random thought I had, and I can't seem to find any answers.                                              I was thinking that if the Earth shrunk that could possibly cause an increase in distance from the sun resulting in earth having less gravitational pull due to the sun having less effect on it?
