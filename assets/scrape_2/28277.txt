Arago Spot in the Shadows of Celestial Bodies

Recently, I've watched this video by Veritasium describing Poisson's Spot, or the Arago Spot. It is explained in the video that near circular (or spherical) objects can produce this optical effect, given that there aren't many obstructions about the circumference of the object to diffuse and scatter the light and the light producing the shadow is more or less in phase.  
My question is, Are Arago Spots possible/Have Arago Spots been observed in the solar shadows of any celestial bodies?
