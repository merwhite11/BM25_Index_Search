Convert dates to julian day number in astropy?

I'm using astropy and I need to convert dates like this: 
2012.06.22_17:56:15_TAI
into julian day number. I tried:
from astropy.time import Time
hmitime = hminew['MidTime']
i=0
print(hmitime[i])
hmi0=Time(hmitime[i],scale='tai')
print(hmi0.jd)

where hmitime it's just the matrix with my dates. But python shows me this:
ValueError: Input values did not match any of the formats where the format keyword is optional [u'datetime', u'iso', u'isot', u'yday', u'fits', u'byear_str', u'jyear_str']

Does anyone know what is wrong? How can I convert my dates??
Thanks
