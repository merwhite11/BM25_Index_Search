Is the orbit of Sirius B based on observation, or derived from the variation in proper motion of Sirius A?

It is common to base models on deduction rather than empirical observation. The orbit of Sirius A is easily seen as variation in proper motion. The orbit of Sirius B, has it been observed, or is it derived from the orbit of Sirius A (which has empirical data underlying it. )
