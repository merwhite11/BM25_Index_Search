A question about stellar magnitude and the pogson's equation

Well surely the eye has different sensitivity to various wavelengths... Will the Pogson's equation  not be affected if say I compare Betelgeuse and Rigel (both having a marked difference in spectral lines)...
Also, how can we ever draw a standard in stellar magnitude observed if both location and individual visual acuity?
Does atmosphere also have any effect??
