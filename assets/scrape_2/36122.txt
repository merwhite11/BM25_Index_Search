Frames per second capabilities cameras currently installed in Modern Telescopes?

What are the present real-time capabilities of various modern telescopes as video cameras?  How do these compare with the capabilities various of space telescopes?
For example, if it was known that there would soon be a Saturn-comet impact (akin to the Shoe-Maker levy impact into Jupiter), what would the "frames per second" of the captured imagery be, regardless of imaging resolution?
Video of the Shoemaker-Levy impact: https://youtu.be/p7RP2SW_gSw?t=92.  Is this video presented in real time?
