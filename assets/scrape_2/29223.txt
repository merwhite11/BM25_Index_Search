Why do we see galaxies with their actual spiral shapes?

Since the actual position of stars is relative, and we see the light they emitted long time ago, and one galaxy has thousands of millions of stars, and those stars can be separated by hundred of thousands of light years, why don't we see galaxies as abstract forms or lines in the sky  as the light of every galaxy star arrives to us at different times instead of well formed spiral shapes? It's like if those millions stars were forming the galaxy as a single light spot, instead of millions of spots separated by light years.
This has been in my head for decades, but I didn't find the question (not even the answer, but the question) anywhere, so either there must be an really easy answer to it or a really complex one or it's a glitch in the Matrix.
