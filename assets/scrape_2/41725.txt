Tradeoffs "upgrading" from a 60/900 refractor to a 150/1200 Dobsonian?

My current/previous telescope is a Skywatcher 60/900 refractor on an equatorial mount. I am now looking at a SkyWatcher 150/1200 "Classic" Dobsonian reflector.
How can I compare the two in terms of ease of use? What will be easier to do, and to see with the larger Dobsonian?  What will be harder?
I want to see planets, galaxy, nebula, etc.
