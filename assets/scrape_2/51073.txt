How long was a year 4 billion years ago, thus how long did it take the Earth to orbit the early Sun?

How long did it take the Earth to orbit the early Sun 4 billion years ago?
I'm not talking rotation, which I know has slowed over time. I'm talking about the orbital period of the early Earth. Was it zipping around the Sun like Mercury or did it take a much longer time than today?
