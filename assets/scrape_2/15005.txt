What is a quaternary mirror and why does the E-ELT need one?

In this recent BBC article I read the one-sentence paragraph:

"Development on the mirrors - in particular, a very complex quaternary mirror - continues apace."

and became interested in the following questions:

What is a quaternary mirror
Why does the E-ELT need one
What is it about this mirror that is "very complex"?

note: the E-ELT is the European Extremely Large Telescope nearing final design, and to be installed in Chile's Atacama Desert (host to many other telescopes).
