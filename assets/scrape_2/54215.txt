What do we know about properties of individual stars in the Andromeda Galaxy?

According to the answers to Visible Stars in Andromeda Galaxy, is it possible to distinguish between different stars in Andromeda galaxy. What I am curious about is how much information are we able to extract about physical details of these objects. What can we tell about such distant stars? Can we resolve their individual masses and types?
Do we know, for example, what is the biggest star within M31? Or perhaps can we tell something only about a couple of special cases (such as variable stars, binary systems or massive giants) and information about individual "standard" stars is lost in the blur?
