Is there a limit to the distance of detectable gravitational wave events?

This is somewhat a follow up question to this one. 
This article indicates that the binaries detected have a distance between 320 and 2840 Mpc. 
With the current technology, is there a limit to the distance of coalescing compact binaries that can be detected through gravitational waves? Or could we potentially see these mergers up to the edge of the cosmos (if there were any)?
