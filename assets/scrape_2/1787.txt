Regarding the curvature of the Earth

I have a doubt in Earth's curvature. This question may be dumb.
How much we need to travel on the Earth to feel the curvature of Earth? Hypothetical case: for example, we are building a vehicle. How much is the length of that vehicle to feel the curvature of the Earth?
A more question, what is about the speed of the Earth. Again a hypothetical case. If we are travelling in aeroplane from one country to other, whether we can take Earth's rotational speed (rotating around it's own axis), and aeroplane speeds as comparables and find the resultant speed?
