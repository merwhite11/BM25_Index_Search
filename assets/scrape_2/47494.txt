Ecliptic and it's poles

Well, I have this picture and a couple of tasks to it:

It is the Sun's path, a.k.a. ecliptic in autumn, 22-23 of September or on the day when autumnal equinox happens. I am to answer these questions:

In the arc of what big circle does the Sun make its daily movement on this day?
Which points of the celestial sphere are the poles of this circle?
At what points on the horizon does the Sun cross it on this day?

My asnwer to the first question is ecliptic. I may misunderstood the second question but I think it is these points (taken from here):

North: right ascension 18h 0m 0.0s (exact), declination +66° 33′
38.55″
South: right ascension 6h 0m 0.0s (exact), declination −66° 33′ 38.55″

But how do I answer the third question: does the Sun cross them over that day?
