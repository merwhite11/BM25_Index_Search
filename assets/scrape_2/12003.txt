How to get from the earth to another planet/ the moon? What happens on the way?

I have a problem explaining for my students how to get from the earth to the moon? Is there someone who can give a good explanation?
I Think these are words that might be included. Escape velocity, gravity, force, free fall, weightless, earth orbit, lunar orbit.(How do the spaceship get into the lunars orbit how do the spaceship get from lunars orbit to the surface of the moon?)
