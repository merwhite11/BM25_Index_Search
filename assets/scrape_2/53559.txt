Why would there be a correction for the orbit of the moon in the (geocentric) model of Ptolemy?

"In order to correctly predict this position (of the celestial bodies), Ptolemy had to assume that the moon followed a path that sometimes brought it twice closer to the earth than at other times" (A brief history of time - Stephen Hawking).
I do not understand this: both in the geocentric as well as the heliocentric model, the moon just revolves around the earth... Why then should there be a correction for the moon? Who can help me with this? I searched on wikipedia and google but didn't found an answer.
