Why is the moon drifting? Shouldn't orbital decay bring it closer?

I noted that the moon drifts away from Earth a few centimeters each year. 
However, I'm thinking that the emission of gravitational waves would deter such thing and cause the exact opposite. Furthermore, the orbital decay due to tidal forces should also slow the mon down, which allows the Earth to pull and being the moon closer. What mechanism is working to drag the moon further away from Earth?
