Do interstellar asteroids decelerate and eventually stop?

I do wonder, do interstellar asteroids eventually stop at one point in space after they gradually decelerate (or) even do they decelerate? 
Though there is no air like on earth and thus asteroids will not be affected by frictional forces, do they have friction with gravitational forces against their trajectories?
If it is so, they might eventually stop. Are there any known objects like that?
