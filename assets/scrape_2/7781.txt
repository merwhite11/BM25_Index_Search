How would Special relativity explain past-present-future if thinking about 13-billion-light-years distanced objects

Halo.
I'm interested in how would Special relativity comment on this:
Suppose there are 2 objects, A and B. They are 13 billion light years away from each other.
When the light from the B object reaches the A, the observer at the A object sees what the (suppose planet, people, objects) were like 13 billion years ago on that object. Let's say it is also an Earth-like planet where the living creatures like exist.
And if the observer at the A object would like to imagine, what is now happening there, what would be the result:

Surely, he would have to wait another 13 billion years to actually
see
Would that mean that the inhabitants (if any) or just matter and
objects at object B exist in future relative to A ones. And vice
versa? If yes, then they both live in present, past and future
tenses at the same time?

Or have I completely lost my way of properly understanding the Special relativity?
