I think I saw a satellite disappear?

I was gazing out of my balcony, and all of a sudden I saw this red light move across the sky. I thought was that it was a star at first, but it didn't blink, so I thought maybe it was a planet but it was moving too quickly. So I thought maybe an airplane, but airplane lights blink too. So I thought I was hallucinating a bit, thatâ€™s when I looked at it again and it started to decrease in size, turn dark red and then disappeared. All of  this happened in seconds. Are you able to help me out on what I just saw?
