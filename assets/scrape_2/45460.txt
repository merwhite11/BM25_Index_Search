Are there automatic methods to locate (stellar and supermassive) black holes?

Black holes have been discovered using several techniques, as outlined by How are black holes found?. What I was wondering is: are there automatic methods for locating them (e.g., artificial intelligence or image analysis techniques), or does the discovery still rely on actual people analyzing, e.g., the movement of stars in a certain portion of the space?
For instance, I remember one of Andrea Ghez's talks and it looked to me that the analysis was performed manually.
Thank you in advance for your time.
