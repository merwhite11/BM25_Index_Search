Logarithmic scale for large distances?

I understand this is an icky subject, but I recently got interested in units for large distances for applications in cosmology and what not (after hearing about the redefinition of the kilo and kelvin), and I was surprised to see many very weird units which seem difficult to use.
So I was thinking in astronomy distances only get larger and larger, so I looked to see if I could find any logarithmic scale for distances and I couldn't find any. Then again, I'm not an astronomer and not suited to argue anything.
Are there any logarithmic scales for larger distances, and if so why aren't they being used? And if non exist, is there a reason why(is it simply a bad idea)? Or is it simply a matter of keeping historical background?
