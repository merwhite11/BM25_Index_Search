How many moons in the solar system have water?

I've heard of a few moons in the solar system that have water, like europa and enceladus. However, I can't find information about whether there are other moons as well. I'm guessing there are more, but I'm not totally sure.
How many moons in the solar system have water (either liquid or frozen)?
