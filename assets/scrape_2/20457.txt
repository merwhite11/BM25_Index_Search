Can a black hole turn back into a star?

I understand that a black hole happens after a star exhaustions elements capable of undergoing fusion.  Without the energy produced by fusion the remaining mass of the star collapses on itself and forms a black hole.  I conclude black holes must be deficient in hydrogen, helium and elements that undergo fusion in stars.  I understand that hydrogen and the like undergoes fusion in stars in part (or completely?) because of the gravitational pressure which occurs in stars.
Suppose a young star replete with hydrogen merged with a black hole.  My question: would the result be a larger black hole, or a radiant star with a very massive heart?  Could a massive infusion of (fusible?) elements reboot the black hole back into a star?
