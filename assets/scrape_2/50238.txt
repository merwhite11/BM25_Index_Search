How can I estimate a stars surface temperature, luminosity, radius, and lifetime only knowing it's solar mass and peak wavelength?

For example: if a 10 solar mass star emits light at a peak wavelength of Î» = 300nm.
How can I calculate a stars surface temperature, luminosity, radius, and lifetime with this infomation?
