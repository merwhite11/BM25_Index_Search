What's that limit, where we start to see infrared galaxies?

All the nearby galaxies we see come in visible range, many are visible from ground based telescopes. And the farthest galaxy that hubble discovered recently, 13.4 billion light years away is in infra red.
Was this Galaxy ever in visible part of spectrum? 
How long will it take galaxies like andromeda or whirlpool to go infrared so that they won't be visible to us if we are not using in infraRed lens?
What's the specific limit where the light makes transition from visible to infrared part of spectrum?
