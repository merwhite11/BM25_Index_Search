If the space is expanding near the speed of light or the speed of light, why Andromeda is approaching or coming near to our galaxy (Milky way)?

Space with distance of 1megaparsec is expanding with rate of 70km/s, and if space with a distance of 4296 megaparsec is expanding at rate of 300,720km/s, then why Andromeda is coming to us? Even there has a dark energy that accelerate the space expansion? Why?
