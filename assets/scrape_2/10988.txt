Why does the focal length of a telescope have an effect on the magnification?

I previously asked that 

Is the angular resolution of a telescope irrespective of used eye-piece?

I learned that the resolution is fixed when the light enters the telescope, and that the eye-piece is used just for magnifying the obtained image at the focal plane.
Now, the magnification of a telescope is calculated as 
$$
\text{magnification} = \frac{\text{focal length of telescope}}{\text{focal length of eye-piece}} \qquad (1)
$$
For example, if the focal length of my telescope is $900$ mm and I am using a $25$Â mm eye-piece, the magnification I get is 
$$
\text{magnification} = \frac{900\ \text{mm}}{25\ \text{mm}} = 36.
$$
However, where does the formula $(1)$ come from? Why is the magnification affected by the focal length of the telescope and eye piece?
(I am using a Newtonian telescope if it matters.)
