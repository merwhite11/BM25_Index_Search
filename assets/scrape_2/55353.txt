How to calculate radio luminosity at a certain frequency from observed radio flux density at another frequency?

$L_R$ can basically calculated by $L_R= v * L_v$ where $v$ is frequency and $L_v=4* \pi * D^2 * F_v$ where $F_v$ is flux density at a certain frequency $v$. I have observational flux density data at $1.4$Ghz and distance data. I need to convert this data to $5$ Ghz observations, because i need to plot $L_X$ vs $L_R$. I know that there is another formula that $L_v= \frac{F_v*4*\pi*D^2}{(1+z)^{1+\alpha}}$ But i dont have z values and probably they are so close to 0. So basically this equation turns into  $L_v=4* \pi * D^2 * F_v$. So any ideas how can i calculate $L_R$ by $1.4$ Ghz data?
