How many earths fit in the observable universe?

I was pondering our insignificance, when I wondered - how much smaller is our planet then the (observable) universe? And being as I don't know how to do the math, I'm asking it here.
So how many of our planet (in space it occupies - i.e. ignoring space between the space between the spheres) can fit inside the known/observable universe?
