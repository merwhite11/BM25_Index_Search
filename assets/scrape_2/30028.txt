Does Mars' "Northern ocean" have another name? What about the "Inland Sea"?

The March 15, 2019 Phys.org article A NASA spacecraft may have explored the edges of an early Mars sea in 1997 shows a stylized map of an area on Mars where the Mars Pathfinder landed and uses colors to indicate where bodies of surface water might have once existed. 
They are labeled as

Northern ocean
Inland Sea

and I noticed they are capitalized. Do these reflect proper nouns and names of possible bodies of water that are recognized by planetary scientists or Martian cartographers (or should I have said Mars cartographers?)? Do these possible bodies of water have other names as well?
