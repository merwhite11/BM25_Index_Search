EPIC 201367065?

I was extremely stoked when I read an article in January of this year that the Kepler2 mission found three Earth-sized objects (one possibly in the habitable zone) transiting a star only 150LY away. I haven't heard anything since, not even if this star and planets (confirmed) have been given a Kepler designation. I guess I would like to know if JWST or some other upcoming mission will be able to give us more info on this system. I can't imagine how excited I will be if TESS gives us something even closer!!
