Is looking through a telescope to do astronomy a thing of the past?

Do astronomers actually look through a telescope with the naked eye or do they mostly look the the data generated by telescopes on computers?
Are they mostly working behind the computer and pencil and paper or is it still stargazing?
Do they actually point a red laser to observe constellations or do they do it all on the computer, and lasers that can point us at constellations are more of a gimmick for amateurs?
I’m sure astronomers would need to look under the lens to confirm the computers aren’t processing data that’s wrong. Do astronomers actually trust the algorithms that automatically do data entry from telescope observed data to their notebooks enough that they usually don’t bother to under the telescope until they’ve confirmed something?
