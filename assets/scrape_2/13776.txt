Sundial (solar clock) in a binary star system

What would a sundial look like in a binary star system? What is the path drawn by the shadows? 
It probably depends on the system, the sizes of the stars, their distance... If you know a binary star system for which a sundial would look different from what we have on Earth, we can take it as an example!
Edit: thank you to barycarter for bringing to attention that the Kepler binary stars would look like one star from the surface of their planets. However, there must be, somewhere, a binary system where both stars are visible, such that the shadows are affected.
EDIT2 : A Google search shows that this question has been answered before, but all links to the answer are dead. - I searched "binary solar system clock", found a link by a "Charmaine Pauls" - 
But after using "sundial" instead, I found this pintrest artwork, but it is not much help. It doesn't seem to be scientifically motivated.
