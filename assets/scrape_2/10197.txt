Does our sun/solar system orbit around any other celestial objects?

Does our solar system orbit around another massive celestial object? Like a massive star or black hole for instance? From my understanding our sun rotates around the centre of our galaxy, thus our solar system follows. But I'm curious to know if there is/are other(s) gravitational force(s) that affect our suns? Other than the rotation around the centre of the milky way.
It would make sense to me that the gravity of massive objects would affect our sun, which in turn would affect our solar system, but I cannot find any answers other than ones concerning the "galactic year".
