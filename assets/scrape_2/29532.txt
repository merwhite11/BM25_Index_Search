Lunar phases if Earth was tidally locked to the Moon

I know that the Earth will never become tidally locked to the Moon, so this is purely hypothetical. 
If I understand correctly, in this hypothetical scenario an Earth day is now a lot longer at around 29 current days, and you can only ever see the Moon from half of the Earth. 
So standing on the "lucky" side of the Earth you should be able to see all the lunar phases during a single night. The Moon become gradually more illuminated, peak as a full Moon and then darken as the night ends. 
Is this correct?
