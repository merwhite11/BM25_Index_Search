Why are heavier hydrocarbons not present in lower part of Uranian atmosphere?

I recently answered this question. While researching for the answer, I found one point quite counter-intuitive. The heavier hydrocarbons resides in stratosphere while methane, the lightest hydrocarbon is more abundant in troposphere which is considered the densest layer. Wikipedia says that heavier hydrocarbons like ethane, methane, diacetylene all condense in a narrow layer between 160 and 320 km in altitude which is the colder lower part of stratosphere forming haze layers while methane which is the most abundant hydrocarbon in Uranus reside in the troposphere. Shouldn't it be the other way around - methane in the upper atmosphere while the heavier and denser HCs all condensing in the lower part of atmosphere?
