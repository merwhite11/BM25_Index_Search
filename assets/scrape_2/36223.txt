Where is the Moon?

I live in Western Australia and I have not seen the moon for almost a solid week. Last I saw it it was almost full, and the sky has been clearer than ever with all the stars bright and visible yet the moon remains invisible. I heard there was a similar occurance in 2016 and wondering if this is the same thing, or should I be concerned?
