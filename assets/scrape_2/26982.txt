Black-hole becoming a star again - follow-up question

Some questions have been posed about black holes becoming stars again once they attract enough hydrogen/atomic matter from another star. Some answers were a forceful NO. Never. However - let's ponder this again:
Question: Once material is absorbed, is there a physical reason why fusion cannot take place once more? Does the process of entering the black hole strip out all the nuclear energy contained in mass/matter? Or is it that matter that makes it past the event horizon has potential to fuse but because of that time dilation due to the already present dense mass make this process take billions of years to resolve?
