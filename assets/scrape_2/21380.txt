How should I find a telescope for research time?

I'm an undergrad in physics and astronomy deciding to look into applying for time on a research telescope, and I'm not sure how to proceed with locating/finding telescopes that I can apply for time on. Specifically, I'm interested in looking at the chemical composition of protostellar disk(s). Any applicable information would be nice.
