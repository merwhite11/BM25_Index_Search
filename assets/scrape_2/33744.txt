The origins of Dark Matter/Dark Energy

Layman here with an affinity for astronomy, space and everything associated with it. I'm a big fan of the space oriented programs on the Discovery and Science channels and I was watching an episode recently that got me to thinking about the origins of Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). Do any of you know if any thought has been given to the creation of DM and DE as byproducts of space being created? As I understand it, as the universe expands it essentially creates space where nothing was before. To be honest, I know nothing about what that even means: creating space where nothing was before.
