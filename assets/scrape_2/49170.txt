Has a magnetic field flip of a distant star ever been measured?


The magnetic field of the Sun flips during each solar cycle, with the flip occurring when sunspot cycle is near its maximum. Levels of solar radiation and ejection of solar material, the number and size of sunspots, solar flares, and coronal loops all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation, from active to quiet to active again, with a period of 11 years.

Has this phenomenon ever been measured, directly or indirectly, on stars outside the solar system?
