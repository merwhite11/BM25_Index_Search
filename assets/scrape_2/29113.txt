Delete key does not always work in IRAF's xgterm on Mac

Sometimes it does not let me delete text in an xgterm terminal and outputs ^H instead.
Example:
Run IRAF:
xgterm -e cl

It opens the xgterm, there I type:
splot black_hole.fits[0]
Image line/aperture to plot (0:) (12): 192

Then I realise I made a mistake and press the Delete key on Mac, and it writes the ^H text instead:
Image line/aperture to plot (0:) (12): 192^H^H

This is very annoying. Is there a way to fix it? 
Note that delete key works in xgterm initially, but breaks and writes ^H in the case above.
I've installed IRAF 2.16 through astroconda iraf-all package on Mac.
Update
The only solution I found was to use PyRAF instead. PyRAF uses the normal Mac's terminal, which does not have those Delete key issues. I can still run the same IRAF commands in PyRAF terminal, so it works fine for me.
