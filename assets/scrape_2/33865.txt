Do gravitational waves really travel in "nothing"?

How does a Gravitational wave create ripple in the fabric of space, if space itself is an empty and it is made-up of nothing. Through out my academic life in school, I was told that space is made-up of nothing. 
If so, then in which medium waves travel? 
If they do indeed travel in "nothing", how is that possible?
