How far away from the sun would I have to be for radiation not to kill me?

If I were freely floating in space within our solar system, and nothing could kill me but radiation from the Sun, what would be the safe distance? I know that Earth´s distance from the Sun would be lethal and I read somewhere that Mars isn´t very homey when it comes to radiation. I need to know what distance a body would have to be from the Sun as to harbor human life with no radiation problems. Thanks in advance.
