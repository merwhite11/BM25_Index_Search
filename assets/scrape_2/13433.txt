What are the prerequisites for a meteorite to reach the ground?

I'm sure it's a function of atmospheric entry angle, meteorite mass (and possibly composition/density), and its velocity, but what function is it?
Above all, how does it depend on velocity? Will the slower meteors impact more often (less kinetic energy to dissipate) or the fast ones (less time spent in the atmosphere = less time to melt and evaporate all the way through)?
