Can't see any detail on planets with my new Celestron NexStar 130 SLT Computerized Telescope

Mars looks like a small white blob/circle and the same with all other planets. This is very frustrating. I've looked all over for a solution jumping from site to site and nothing. Please be different on this site.
Edit: Many people have marked this post as duplicate. Yes, I know, but the other post did not answer my question.
