What's going on in this photo of Halley's comet's tail?

When researching for this answer I was looking at Space.com's 2011 article Photos of Halley's Comet Through History
I saw the image below, and read the caption.

Halley's Comet in 1910

NASA/JPL
Halley's Comet as photographed May 13, 1910, by a wide-angle camera at Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Ariz., during the comet's last appearance. A streak across the comet near the coma is a meteor trail, and not a scratch on the negative. Streaks at the bottom right are the city lights of Flagstaff Bright spot above the city lights is the planet Venus.

I know that 109 years ago astrophotography wasn't what is is today, but the combination of the overexposed venus, the coincident meteor trails, the non-uniform star trails blending in with the comet's tail breakup along with the unlikely looking "smoke trail" from the upper side of the comet's tail make this photo look quite unusual.
Question: What's going on with that second tail thing above the main tail? The shape looks so unnatural, it seems to have a parallel extent rather than radiate from the coma. What caused this?

"bonus points" for identifying the photo in some catalog, or in a publication.
