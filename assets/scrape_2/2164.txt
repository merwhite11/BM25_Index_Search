Where will I be able to see the Lyrid meteor shower?

So supposedly the Lyrids meteor shower will take place between early morning April 16th to 22nd - correct me if I am wrong. I am aged 15 and am interested in skywatching, I just wondered will it be visible from the northern Hemisphere? Or will it be like the lunar eclipse and only be visible in the Western Hemisphere? Thanks.
