Amateur astronomy plan for GCSE students

I'm designing an amateur astronomy observational plan for GCSE Astronomy students here in the UK. I would like some advise to the suitability of what I have selected as the content.

For the beginner level I have decided to see if they can image the
various phases of the Moon across a 28 day period.
For the intermediate level I would say they could image the Pleiades.
For the advanced level I have decided they can create a mosaic of M31
from various narrow field-of-view images. (I would suggest imaging
the LMC or SMC but we are based here in the northern hemisphere).

Would this be suitable targets over the course of a year?
