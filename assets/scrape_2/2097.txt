How would water waves behave in partial gravity?

Would an "indoor" pool of water on the Moon or on Mars behave differently than on Earth? Would the waves caused by a splash be higher or lower? Would they propagate faster or slower? Would boyance be different? And what would it be like to shower in slowly falling water?
