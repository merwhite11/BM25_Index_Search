Why is the Moon's volume so small compared to the Earth's?

The Moon has 27.3% of the Earth's radius/diameter but only 2% of the Earth's volume. I don't quite get it why the Moon's volume is that small despite having more than a quarter the 2-dimensional size of Earth. Compared to the Earth, does the Moon really have 2% of the Earth's 3-dimensional size? Why is it like this with the Moon and other bodies of similar diameters?
