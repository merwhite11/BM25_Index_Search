Pictures of a curious astronomical phenomenon

In a recent holiday, a friend made the following picture. It contains a curious green "thing" in the nightsky. The picture was made in Ladakh, India, 6weeks ago.
The "thing" only appeared in one of the pictures (others were made a few minutes earlier and later). He didn't see it with the naked eye (but didnt look at the sky during the exposure).

Camera: Canon EOS 350D DIGITAL
7 sec exposure
ISO: 1600
f-number: 4

What could that be?
