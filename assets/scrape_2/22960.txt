How large was Mercury before it shrunk?

There's a theory that the reason Mercury has such an enormous iron core is that it was once a much larger planet before it got impacted by an object, resulting in most of its mass getting blasted away. If this theory is true, how large was Mercury before the impact? Could it have been the size of Earth or Mars, or maybe even a super-earth?
