Is radiation from neutron stars delayed by time dilation?

I understand a neutron star to be the densest stuff that can exist without becoming a black hole, the densest thing which directly gives off radiation we can detect. At the event horizon of a black hole, time stands still, in our frame of reference.
Does there exist neutron stars which are very close to getting an event horizon?
Does this "neutron star horizon" cause time dilation, a zone from within of which movement is very slow in our frame of reference?
Could it for example be that the first light from a neutron star itself reaches us billions of years after the light of the supernova of the "classical" star which created the neutron star and its event-horizon like relativistic effects?
