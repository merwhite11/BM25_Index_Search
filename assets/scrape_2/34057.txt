Dark matter hypothesis and visible light

Dark matter is hypothesized as the mass based on gravitational observations is much higher than that observed via measuring how bright a galaxy is.
Why could it not be that multiple stars in the distant galaxy are in a straight line, blocking one another from view and so the brightness from the hidden stars can't be measured? Similar to how during a solar eclipse, the sun is not visible behind the moon? Granted the moon is much closer than the sun and blocks out most of the sun, but cumulatively the brightness from multiple stars in the line of sight would not add up.
