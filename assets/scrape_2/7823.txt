Energetics of Titans Tholin haze

So, I've googled and wiki'd on this, but no clue, so I turn my question to the community:
Given Titan's nice orange haze that is supposedly composed of Tholins and strangely coincides with its stratosphere (taken from wikipedia)

I got to think whether the haze takes the role of clouds on earth when it comes to energetics. From this a bunch of questions arose:

Do we know whether the haze is responsible for heat trapping and thus, the formation of a stratosphere on Titan?
What about radiation transport modelling with those particles, is this successful?
Also I'd be interested in what we know about the stability of Tholins. Could they survive harsh irradiation that atmospheres on Hot Jupiters do encounter?

I would like to be able to make a statement such as "Dust" or "Haze-controlled" energetics for the stratosphere of Titan, if this is so. It would be nice if you helped to clear this up.
