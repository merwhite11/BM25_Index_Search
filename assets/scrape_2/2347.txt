Are neutrinos affected by gravity fields?

Am asking if a neutrino can be pull by the gravity field of a quasar or a black hole, assuming the neutrino have momentum. It could be possible in the that a neutrino can orbit a black hole at an orbit equivalent to the Schwarzschild radius give or take. If it even possible for a neutrino to go through a black hole?
