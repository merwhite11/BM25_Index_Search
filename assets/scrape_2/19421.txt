Neutrinos passing through black holes

What would happen to a neutrino that, traveling parallel to the black hole, crossed it's event horizon?  Would it come through the other side unaffected? Or, A neutrino and a black hole just happen to be traveling in the same direction but the neutrino get close enough to cross the event horizon.  Is it now trapped inside the event horizon even though technically it only interacted with the black hole on a gravitational level?
