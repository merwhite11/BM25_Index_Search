What will happen to a metal asteroid if it impacts the Earth? Will it disintegrate or will it stay intact?

I recently read about the Psyche asteroid which is mostly metal. It got me wondering: what if a metal asteroid  (not the size of Psyche - maybe about 1 mile long and 1 mile wide) impacted the Earth's surface?
Will the asteroid break apart into pieces? I am talking about a metal asteroid. What if the asteroid impacts a planet like Mars?  Will the strength of gravity have an effect on whether the asteroid breaks apart or not?
