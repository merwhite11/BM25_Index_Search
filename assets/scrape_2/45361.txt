What is notable about LOFAR's sub-arcsecond radio resolution of distant galaxies? Does lower freq. range enable new capabilities that mm wave can't?

The BBC's Astronomers see galaxies in ultra-high definition covers some news related to papers in Astronomy & Astrophysics' dedicated, open access issue Sub-arcsecond imaging with the International LOFAR Telescope.
With a top frequency of 240 MHz ($\lambda$ = 1.3 meters) and nominal diameter of 1000 km I ballpark the achievable resolution at about 0.3 arcseconds, consistent with the news.
While not as large in diameter, ALMA's resolution in Wikipedia is about 0.01 arcseconds because of it's "millimeter" wavelength range (at nearly 1 THz the shortest wavelength is a fraction of a millimeter).
Question: What is notable about LOFAR's sub-arcsecond radio resolution of distant galaxies? Does the lower frequency range enable new capabilities that millimeter waves can't for this type of observation?
