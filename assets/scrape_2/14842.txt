Are there radio white dwarfs?

We have discovered about 2500 radio pulsars. Part of them show pulsations in other bands like X-ray and gamma ray. The radiation mechanism remains unclear now.
I wonder whether there are radio pulsations caused by the spins of white dwarfs. It is the best to give reference papers.
