How can I retro search for time periods with specific planetary alignments?

Let's say we have a planetary ecliptic longitudes of an unknown period.
What program or software or procedure can one use to arrive at the range of time periods where the planets were in those ecliptic longitudes?

Basically I'm mainly looking for a time period for conjunction of Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus , Mars, Jupiter and Saturn around 22 Deg from of J2000 vernal equniox, with a range of 8 Deg on either side. So all the planets must be within 14 Deg to 30 Deg from J2000 equinox. If 8 Deg is too narrow, we can at maximum try for 14 Deg range, so from 8Deg to 36 Deg.
