Why the Circumstellar Habitable Zone is defined as it is, if life could be possible outside of it?

According to Circumstellar habitable zone

In astronomy and astrobiology, the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ), or simply the habitable zone, is the range of orbits around a star within which a planetary surface can support liquid water given sufficient atmospheric pressure

But then you have moons in the solar system such as Titan, Europe, Enceladus where some scientists believe life could be possible.

Why the CHZ is defined as it is, if life could be possible outside of it? Is it pourly defined or scientists believing there could be life outside the CHZ in the solar system are having too much wishful thinking?
