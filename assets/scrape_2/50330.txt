What fraction of meteorites found on Earth are for practical purposes non-magnetic?

Of all the meteorites that land on Earth's surface that are let's say pebble to fist sized, what fraction are for practical purposes non-magnetic1?
I think the number is around 10 or 20% but so far I haven't found a good source.
One challenge to getting a number is that theres a lot of bias; some people drag magnets around or use metal detectors and will miss the ones with low nickel/iron, and some people look in the top layers of snow in Antarctica and the dark ones might get warmer and sink quicker into the snow/ice.
Therefore with so much bias it might be hard to find a clear, authoritative answer. But maybe there is one.
