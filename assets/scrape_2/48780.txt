Pairs of galaxies that look like the Whirlpool-galaxy with companion?

I need examples of pairs of galaxies that look like the Whirlpool-galaxy with its companion NGC-5195. That is spirals with a companion galaxy attached to one arm, see picture below. I already know about Arp86 and NGC-4911 may be the spiral galaxy of such a pair also. But are there more?
