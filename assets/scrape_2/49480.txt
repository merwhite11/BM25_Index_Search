What is the difference between New Moon day and Lunar Eclipse?

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth is in between Sun and Moon. OK, I understand this (see diagram from Nasa).
A new moon is also when the Earth is in between Sun and Moon. So, why are they not the same? What am I missing?
I can sense something is different because, a Lunar Eclipse only occurs during a Full Moon and not a New Moon.
