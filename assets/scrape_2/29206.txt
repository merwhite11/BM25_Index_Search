Universe isn't infinite theory

Forgive me if any of my terminology is off I am no physicist but I have wondered about this question for a while.
I have read in various books that if the universe was infinite, and uniformly created the whole sky would be white. This is because in every possible location in the sky there would be a star emitting light. Sort of like pixels, filling a screen.
I thought about this and wondered, doesn't this therefore imply that light is never absorbed by another medium?
What if a distant stars light is absorbed, therefore never reaching earth, giving the illusion that there are less stars?
