For what aspects of cosmology research can a software engineer contribute?

I'm a software engineer and I would love to learn more about cosmology by participating in this field. I'd like to change my career path closer to it and further from web programming. But I don't know how software engineers can contribute to the field of cosmology.
I'm now interested in finding a way to create a bridge between cosmology and software engineering in order to work in this field.
So far I have only thought of one position that can be helpful in this field, that of the data scientist.
Are there others?
