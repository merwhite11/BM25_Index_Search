How big does the moon have to be to have the Earth tidally locked to it

I would like a earth-moon system like Pluto-Charon (but with earth instead of Pluto) where both will be tidally locked to each other within something like a billion years. As the moon would probably lock to earth before the opposite how big the moon has to be?
