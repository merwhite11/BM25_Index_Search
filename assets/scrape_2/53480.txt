Could the redshift of all incoming photons be explained by a massive ring of distant masses pulling the sources of the photons away?

ChatGPT and wikipedia have informed me that the primary evidence for the theory that the universe is expanding is the fact that photons that arrive to our planet from all directions are being redshifted, and this redshift is directly proportional to the distance from our earth to the origin of the source of the light.
Although universal expansion does explain this observation
Could it also be explained by having a ring of unimaginably dense concentrations of matter all around us, far away from what we can observe, which cause the redshift of the photons we detect by pulling the sources of those photons, (stars, galaxies whatever they may be) by gravitation?
this would imply two main problems of course:
(1) The issue that the amount of redshift is approximately proportional to the distance of the source. Perhaps the current model of gravitation breaks down at such scales and gravity behaves differently, if so this would also explain why the redshift we can determine of incoming photons is greater the further the origin is, because the net gravitational effects and thus the acceleration on that photon source would be greater as it moves closer and closer to a particular section of the perimeter, thus intensifying the doppler effect
(2) Why don't we or other observable astronomical bodies accelerate away too?
Perhaps we are in a sweet spot where the gravitational effects by this ring of masses roughly cancel out.
Or perhaps we are accelerating towards a particular section on the perimeter of this  ring, along with our entire galaxy we just don't realise it.
I look forward to a retort to this idea which has sat in my brain for a while now, googling didn't really help because I could not think of a "googlable" way of formulating it.
