Hohmann transfer orbit (Earth-Jupiter system)

Consider the Hohmann transfer orbit of a probe launched from Earth to Jupiter. Assume the orbits of Earth and Jupiter are circular.
I want to calculate the following:

The semi-major axis and eccentricity of Hohmann transfer orbit from Earth to Jupiter.
The speed of the probe at Earth.
The launch speed of the probe from Earth to reach Jupiter.
The duration of the flight to Jupiter.
The elongation of Jupiter at launch to ensure that the probe arrives at Jupiter.

Here my attempt:

$a = \frac{1}{2}(r_E + r_J) = \frac{1}{2}(1+ 5.203) = 3.102 \text{ AU}, \ \ e = 1 âˆ’ \frac{r_E}{a} = 0.677$
I am thinking of using the vis-viva equation but I don't know what I should use for $r$? Should I use $r_E$ = 1 AU for $r$ where $r_E$ is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun? Am I right? Please correct me if I am wrong.
I am thinking of using the escape velocity formula where $M$ is the mass of the Earth and $R$ is the radius of the Earth. Please correct me if I am wrong.
$t = \frac{1}{2}P = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{a^3} = 2.73 \text{ years}$.
I really don't know how to do this question. Please help.
