How many stars are in the constellation Canis Minor?

I've read Wikipedia and found a list of stars in Canis Minor, and counted the number of stars in the list. I came up with 56 stars, a surprising number. I did some more research and found that Canis Minor was just the two binary stars orbiting together: Procyon and Gomeisa. So I came to the conclusion that the answer could be found here somewhere. Please help and tell me how many stars the constellation Canis Minor is made of. Thank you.
