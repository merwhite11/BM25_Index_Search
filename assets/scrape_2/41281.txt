What is the naming convention for craters on Mercury?

The two largest craters on Mercury are names Caloris (meaning "hot") and Rembrandt (for the painter). So there doesn't seem to be a pattern.
By convention, craters on Mars are named for people who studied the planet (like Cassini) or wrote about it (like Bradbury).
Is there a similar naming convention for the craters at the surface of Mercury?
