What is the typical resolving power of the largest optical telescopes?

I'd like to estimate the typical resolving power of the largest optical telescopes. 
I've calculated the theoretical resolving power of the VLA for 21 cm light, $$R=\frac{\lambda}{B}=\frac{2.1 \times 10^{-1} m}{2.7 \times 10^4 m}=1.6 ''$$
And I know that the largest optical telescopes on Earth are GTC, Keck 1 & 2, SALT, VLT, etc. 
But I don't know how to calculate a typical resolving power in practice. How can I make this estimate taking into account astronomical seeing and other effects?
