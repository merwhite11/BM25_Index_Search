What is the closest galaxy?

I think that the galaxy closest to the Earth, that is, to the Milky Way, is the nebula called Andromeda, which is 2.5 million light years away. Despite this great distance, M31 is visible, and very pretty. Are there any galaxies closer to the Milky Way than the Andromeda galaxy?
