Which star system has the highest multiplicity (# of stars), whose orbits are known for all stars?

I posed a question on here a couple months or so ago about the orbital patterns of each of the seven stars in the two septuple star systems Nu Scorpii and AR Cassiopeiae. It went unanswered for more than 3 years, but it was finally answered. So, now I want to know which multiple star system has the highest multiplicity for which we actually do know the orbits of all the stars in the system.
To be clear, I am NOT talking about a star with multiple planetary or other smaller bodies. I am talking about multiple STAR systems, with a high multiplicity, or number of stars. Again, I'm not talking about every rock larger than a school bus. I mean STARS. Stars that have nuclear fusion occurring.
