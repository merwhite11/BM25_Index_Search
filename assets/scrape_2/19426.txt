Parallax due to the motion of the Sun

Generally, the parallax is contributed to by the motion of the Earth around the Sun. However, at the same time, the Sun is moving too. It carries the Earth with it. Presumably, the shift of the Sun is bigger than the Earth-Sun distance, so that will also cause apparent shift of a star in the background.
I am not so familiar with astronomy. Is my argument correct?
