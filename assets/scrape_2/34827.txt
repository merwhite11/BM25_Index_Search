Do we know a star that is similar to the Sun when it would be a red giant?

In about 5 billion years the Sun is predicted to become a red giant and have more than 200 times its current size, reaching a radius of about 5 AU when largest. 
I wonder what spectral class the Sun would have then, I think somewhere from M1III to M5III. Do we know a red giant star that is similar to what the Sun is predicted to become?
