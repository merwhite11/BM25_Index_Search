Total solar eclipse, supermoon, and spring equinox all happening at the same time: anything special about this?

Today (March 20, 2015) is seeing a rare combination of the spring equinox, a total solar eclipse, and a supermoon.  I am wondering if there is anything special astronomically about all three of these happening at the same time, like is the equinox a particularly more or less likely time for solar eclipses to happen (my guess is that it has no impact eclipses).  
The supermoon/total solar eclipse combination doesn't seem surprising to me, since if the opposite were to happen (moon far away and solar eclipse) we would end up with an annular eclipse instead of a total eclipse.
