Is HR 5171 a Spectroscopic Binary or a Symbiotic?

Is HR 5171, the largest yellow star in the galaxy a symbiotic star where one feeds off the other? Or is it a spectroscopic binary where its only possible to determine that there are two stars by spectral analysis?
Will the smaller be consumed by the larger one as was in the possible case of BP Piscium? Or is the smaller one being born?
Is the star both, one or the other or neither?
I looked at Simbad but it only calls a Double or Multiple Star System. That is too vague for me.  Calling it a Close Contact Binary is also too vague.  I know they call it an EBS.
If anyone wants an idea of the star, visit the following artist's impression.
