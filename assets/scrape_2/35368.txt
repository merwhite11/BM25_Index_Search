How to find how many degrees from the beginning to the end of the sunset?

According to what I what told here there is 0.5 degrees from the beginning the end of the sunset. 
Unfortunately I didn't understand two things: 

1) How can I prove in the simplest way that there's 0.5 degrees only
  from the beginning to the end of the sunset. 
2) Why it is not adjust to my past observation on these phases (which
  was much longer (range from 5-7 minutes). which makes it between 1-2
  degrees.
