Modifying Heisenberg's unified field theory with gravity

How would Hisenberg's unified field equations be represented if gravity is incorporated. Would it result in a case similar to the Heisenberg-Ivanenkov equation, or am I just confused here?
I would really appreciate if the Heisenberg-Ivanenkov equation's essence is explained as there is no firm online source to provide more information.
