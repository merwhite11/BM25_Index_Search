How did WASP-18b exoplanet form?

I am new to this community and not quite sure if this is an appropriate question to be asked here. Anyways its just my curiosity. As far as I could know about WASP-18b is that, it orbits very close to its sun and takes less than 24 hours to complete one orbit. However this was not the case always, as the planet actually was formed in a cold part of the space and later got tug into of its sun's gravitational pull. 
Given this is the case, I am curious to know how it was formed in the first place? If I am not wrong planets are formed when the debris orbiting in the gravitational pull of a star stick together overtime gets in to the form of the planetary bodies. So, if WASP-18b was not always so close to its sun and it was formed far away in cold space, then could there be a possibility that, this exoplanet was formed in an orbit of another star and overtime it got away from its original orbit and trapped in the tug of its current sun? (Its my imagination! just bare with it :)) 
Also could any one point me to good documentations from where I can learn more. 
Thanks
