Faster than light?

From what popular science tells us, if I travel at close to the speed of light, I'd age slower.
So if I travel at 99% of SOL and travel the distance of one light year, for other people one year has passed. But for me, hardly any time has passed.
So - for me and my ship, we travelled one light year in very little time. If that is the case, then for me I travelled much faster than the speed of light!
How does that reconcile with the statement that nothing can exceed the speed of light?
