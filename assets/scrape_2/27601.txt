What would stargazing be like at the edge of our galaxy?

Let's say, for the sake of speculation, we acquire the technology necessary to travel to the outer edge of one of the spiral arms of our galaxy. We go to a star in this "outer rim" and land on a planet orbiting a star there. What would we see when our side of the planet is facing outward from the galaxy? (Assume no atmospheric interference.) The answer will, of course, depend on the galactic coordinates of the star we choose to visit. Provided a particular set of coordinates, how much do we know about what we could see with the naked eye or through some form of optical instrument? I'm more interested in our ability to answer the question, rather than the specific objects we'd see (although they're pretty interesting too). You're welcome to select an arbitrary but still useful and appropriate boundary as the edge of the spiral arm.
