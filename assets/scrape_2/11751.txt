Venus presents same face toward Earth at closest approach. What do you make of that?

Is reference 6 in this Wikipedia article "dubious" and this passage in need of excising or clarifying?

Venus's 583.92-day interval between successive close approaches to Earth is equal to 5.001444 Venusian [sic] solar days, making approximately the same face visible from Earth at each close approach. Whether this relationship arose by chance or is the result of some kind of tidal locking with Earth is unknown.

Is it still an "unknown" or "crazy idea that didn't develop with further investigation"?
The idea that Venus is tidally locked with Earth sounds far-fetched. We understand the slowing of Earth's rotation, and I don't recall ever reading of Venus's resistance to the change!
