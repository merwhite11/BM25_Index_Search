Trouble Seeing Distant Planets Such as Jupiter and Uranus

I am a beginner and I am using a Celestron AstroMaster 114 telescope. Whenever I try to view distant planets such as Jupiter I am presented with a black circle that has black lines leading from it. In between these lines is a white blur. When I focus the telescope using the focus knob, the black circle along with the white blur shrink to the size of a star in the night sky before becoming larger. I don't have this viewing the moon and in fact was able to see a very breathtaking image of it. I am using the star finder with the red dot and I have aligned it during the day so my star finder and my telescope are looking at the same thing. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
