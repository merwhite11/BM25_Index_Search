If you were on a planet orbiting a star that has a black hole companion, could you see light from your host star bent 180 degrees?

I realize that there is a distance from a black hole where photons can orbit. I understand that this orbit is very unstable, but I am concerned with photons just outside this range. Could the black hole cause them to 'u-turn' so that you could see some light from your star when looking at the black hole?
