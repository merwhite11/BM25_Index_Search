View of other planets from the Earth

There appears to be varying positions/spots of view of other planets from Earth, if I'm not wrong. Now, given that all planets are on the same plane, why do their positions change on the night sky for similar seasons, when they come back to earth's view? How is this possible?
Shouldn't all the outer planets be observed within the horizon's range (and not in the high skies), now that they lie on the earth's tropical plane? Give or take a short distance from where the horizon 'touches' the ground?
