Are planets more likely to have dense materials at their cores?

When planets are forming, does the densest material sink the core and the less dense material "float" on top? What I'm asking is that are the more dense materials more likely to appear in the core rather than the surface. I'm also wondering, can a planet have an iron surface and still have rock beneath the surface in its crust and core?
