At what distance does MOND Modified Newtonian Dynamics take effect?

At what distance does MOND Modified Newtonian Dynamics take effect?  I understand MOND is described in relation to very slow accelerations, which is related to distance.  It is mentioned it has an affect within galaxies and between galaxies but not within solar systems.  But there obviously should be a 'line' at which Kepler's laws no longer apply and MOND takes over.  The smallest galaxies, near galactic centers, very large black holes, etc.
I'm also wondering how a body at the 'border' would behave.
