SKA 101: How will it "perform the most precise tests of Einstein's theories" and Australia & South Africa arrays be "made to work seamlessly together"

The BBC's December 7, 2022 SKA: Construction to begin on world's biggest telescope includes the following:

It will perform the most precise tests of Einstein's theories

and

The first major milestone should come in 2024, when four dishes in Australia and six antenna stations in South Africa are made to work seamlessly together as a basic telescope. This proof-of-principle moment will then trigger the array's full roll-out.

These may seem like two separate questions, but since it's obviously part of the press kit and PR roll-out, I think it's likely sources will have basic answers to both. So I'd like to ask for basic "SKA 101" answers to:
Question: How will the SKA "perform the most precise tests of Einstein's theories" and the Australia & South Africa arrays be "made to work seamlessly together"?
I didn't think there was any overlap in frequency between the arrays on different continents, so while they could both observe the same spot of sky at the same time, I don't see how that could be though of as working together in a "seamless" way.
Isn't registration of image data from different instruments a pretty standardized operation these days and something that one would normally do offline at a later date?
Does this seamlessness have something to do with time-domain-astronomy?
