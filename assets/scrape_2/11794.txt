The largest discrepancy in the history of science

I watched a cosmology lecture given by Leonard Susskind that convinced me to put my money on dark energy being a pressure caused by energy that is evenly distributed throughout the "vacuum" of space. However, quantum physics predicts that there should be a much larger energy density (i.e. many magnitudes larger). Have there been any more recent findings or theories that could shed light on this discrepancy?
