Why aren't stars like Eternally Collapsing Objects?

We know that stellar radiation pressure balances the gravitational compressive forced of a star. Are there other factors which resist such a collapse? Also, if radiation pressure balances gravitational compression, shouldn't the process of shrinking be a quasistatic process making stars Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECOs)?
