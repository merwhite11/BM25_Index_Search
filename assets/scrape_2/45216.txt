Is there a clearer version of Giuseppe Piazzi's complete set of observations for the discovery of Ceres?

The image below comes from the paper Giuseppe Piazzi and the Discovery of Ceres G . Foder√† Serio, which is too blurry to read. Is there a clearer version of this table or digital tabular form like .csv or something?
