Can an observer on Earth only see half of the sky?

Is this the following statement true?

An observer on earth only may see half of sky from the northern or southern hemisphere, and even if the observer stands on the equator on top of a very high mountain, he will hardly be able to see all the stars in the sky in given period!

Do most globe-like objects in space have this property?
I'd appreciate any more remarks on the subject.
