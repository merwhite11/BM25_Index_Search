What kills us in the event of two galaxies combining?

I find the joining of galaxies interesting as the two eventually become ONE. On series I saw on a discovery channel stated we die.  Everyone dies. What is it that causes us to die when the galaxies combine? Is it something colliding with the Earth from the other galaxy such as a planet? Is it the drastic element changes on the Earth such as extreme temperatures or flooding, etc. Do we have any percent of surviving on Earth?
