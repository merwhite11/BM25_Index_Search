How moon is visible during sun is still shining, simple explanation please!

Sometimes I observed there is moon on sky at noon and sun is also shining.
How is this possible?
I also observed dull moon is still on sky at 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM while sun is rising. My local time is UTC+5.
If possible, please explain it in simple words without using advanced astronomy terminology if possible, thanks!
