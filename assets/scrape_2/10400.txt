Is it certain that dark matter consists of particles? (And not just curved space)

The main idea about dark matter today seems to be supersymmetry. That there exists a set of yet undiscovered fundamental particles which (in a mathematically most convenient way) mirror the particles already known.
But has it been established that dark matter consists of particles at all? Couldn't it for example be a continuous property of space itself in some regions? That some parts of space are curved without the influence of any particles or waves. Is anything but particles ruled out?
