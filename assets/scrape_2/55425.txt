Flux from the Sun on the Earth using the Stefan-Boltzmann law

What is wrong with this computation, plase? I am getting the result of 4291.65 W m^{-2} instead of 1361 W m^{-2}. Thank you very much
import numpy as np

R_S = 6.957e8  # m
au = 149597870700 # m
sigma_SB = 5.670374419e-8 # W m-2 K-4

# Sun parameters
R = 1 * R_S
d = 1 * au
T = 5777.2  # K


Earth_factor = R**2 * np.pi / d**2

E = sigma_SB * T**4 * Earth_factor
print('SB', E)
