What is the rarest stable element in the universe?

I am making a hard sci-fi game with a focus on realism, in this game there is a need for a hard element to base money off of. Similar to how gold is used on earth.

I know there are lots of elements that only exist for seconds at a time that are technically rare but wouldn't work as a currency. What element in the universe would aliens be most likely to be trading back and forth?
