What is the largest cluster of merging galaxies?

Reading about the Andromedaâ€“Milky Way collision, a galactic collision predicted to occur in about 4.5 billion years between the two galaxies, I went to the galaxy merger page and Wikipedia states that : 

One of the largest galaxy mergers ever observed consisted of four elliptical galaxies in the cluster CL0958+4702.

The universe is a big place and wikipedia is not the most thorough with this subject.

Galaxy cluster MACS J0717, one of the most complex and distorted galaxy clusters known, is the site of a collision between four clusters. It is located about 5.4 billion light years away from Earth.
