The moon has just the right speed not to crash on the Earth or escape into space. What are the odds?

My understanding is that the moon was created a long time ago when Earth was hit by a big asteroid.
The debris then agglomerated into the Moon, which happens to be orbiting at the exact speed required to neither crash back into the Earth, nor escape into space.
Having the exact correct speed seems extremely unlikely. Yet, our moon is there, and many other planets have moons.
Are these just the few survivors out of thousands of events that didnt have the « goldilock » speed?
2022 Edit:  I got my "ah HA!" moment where everything makes sense after playing 10 minutes of the tutorial of the "Kerbal Space Program" game. Highly recommended.
