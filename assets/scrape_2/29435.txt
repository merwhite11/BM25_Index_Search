Geographical Point of the Sun

I want to draw a Sun in a 3d scene, so I figured the easiest way would be to calculate the latitude and longitude of the point perpendicular to Sun position and then just move it "up".
As a starting point, I want to calculate it's equatorial coordinates: declination and right ascension.
I followed instructions from this page, also cross-referencing with this one
Here's my code (in Swift):
import Foundation

class Astronomy {

  static func julianDays(since: Date) -> Double {
    return since.timeIntervalSince1970 / 86400 + 2440587.5
  }

  static func daysSinceJ2000(for date: Date) -> Double {
    return julianDays(since: date) - 2451545
  }

  static func sunAxialTilt(for daysSinceJ200: Double) -> Double {
    return 23.4393 - 3.563e-7 * daysSinceJ200
  }

  static func sunEquatorialPosition(on date: Date) -> (declination: Double, RA: Double, distance: Double) {
    let daysSinceGreenwichNoon = daysSinceJ2000(for: date)
    var meanLongitude = 280.460 + 0.9856474*daysSinceGreenwichNoon
    var meanAnomaly = 357.528 + 0.9856003*daysSinceGreenwichNoon
    meanLongitude = meanLongitude.rangedUpTo360
    meanAnomaly = meanAnomaly.rangedUpTo360
    let eclipticLongitude = meanLongitude + 1.915*sin(meanAnomaly.radians) + 0.020*sin(2*meanAnomaly.radians)

    let distanceToEarth = 1.00014 - 0.01671*cos(meanAnomaly.radians) - 0.00014*cos(2*meanAnomaly.radians)

    let axialTilt = sunAxialTilt(for: daysSinceGreenwichNoon)
    let rightAscension = atan2(cos(axialTilt.radians)*sin(eclipticLongitude.radians), cos(eclipticLongitude.radians))
    let declination = asin(sin(axialTilt.radians)*sin(eclipticLongitude.radians))

    return (declination: declination.degrees, RA: rightAscension.degrees, distance: distanceToEarth)
  }
}

extension Double {
  var radians: Double {
    return self * .pi / 180
  }

  var degrees: Double {
    return self  * 180 / .pi
  }

  var rangedUpTo360: Double {
    let multiples = (self/360).rounded(.down)
    return self - 360*multiples
  }
}

However, it does not seem to be working correctly. As of the time I write this article, the result is declination -16.98772292697088, RA -44.80674952684117. Compared with https://theskylive.com/sun-info the declination is about right (-17° 03’ 38”), but right ascension is way off:  20h 59m 43s, which is 314.93 degrees according to this site
What went wrong?
Edit:
As it turned out nothing was wrong, I can get to the second part: calculating the geographical point. (the title suggests it after all)
AFAIK for latitude, I can use declination as is and for longitude, I 
need to calculate Greenwich Hour Angle(GHA)
After examining several articles, I found these equations:
SHA[°] = 360 – 15 · RA[h] 
GHAAries[°] = 15 · GST[h] 
GHA = SHA + GHAAries 

For my case, I suppose I may use RA as is, without multiplying its hour component by 15. What keeps me a bit puzzled is GST:

May I use Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time instead if I don't need the calculations to be super precise?
Is there any "GST for dummies"? All the calculations I found rely on some floating second offset, I found this table but have no idea how to use it.
