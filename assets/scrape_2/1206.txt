What can we expect from the first accurate image of a black hole?

From recent news from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy:

The European Research Council (ERC) has awarded 14 Million Euros to a
  team of European astrophysicists to construct the first accurate image
  of a black hole. The team will test the predictions of current
  theories of gravity, including Einstein's theory of General
  Relativity.

I've seen computer depictions of black holes in the past, are they similiar to what we can expect from this new endeavour? 
In the next image we can see a computer model of a black hole of ten solar masses as seen from a distance of 600km with the Milky Way in the background with a horizontal camera opening angle of 90 degrees:
