What is meant by "short lived" in the duration of a planetary nebula?

In this wikipedia article, it describes planetary nebula as "short-lived," but I'm not sure in relation to what?  This could mean billions of years in some contexts.
How long is short-lived?
Bonus if there are any useful rules of thumb in astronomy terms for future uses (how stars timelines are described, versus galaxies, etc.)
