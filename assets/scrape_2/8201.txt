Are there stars in the first photo from space?

Wikipedia has this photo (see below) labelled "First photo from space" which was taken in 1946 from a U.S. launched German V-2 rocket. Approximately two thirds of the image is a section of the Earth showing some clouds and their shadows. The photo is very grainy so it's hard to see much more detail than this (I can't make out any land masses as all).
In the large black section occupying the top-left corner there are some very faint dots. Are these dirt on the lens, marks on the film, JPG artifacts or are they actually stars?
