What would a moon with a six-month orbital period look like from the earth?

This is a kind of follow-up question to "What orbital period would produce one New Moon (and one Full Moon) each year?"
Given the six-month orbital period that is needed to produce one New Moon and one Full Moon each year, what would such a satellite look like as it made its progress through the sky (assuming we are in a system that is as close to our current situation as possible)?
In other words, I am wondering things like:

How long would it take the moon to cross the sky?
What kind of moonrise and moonset times would we expect, and how would they vary with the seasons (if at all)?
What would be the effect on tides?
What other observable effects (observable by mere mortals going about their business, that is, rather than astronomers or astrophysicists) would result from a moon with a six-month orbital period?

Grateful for any insights here.
