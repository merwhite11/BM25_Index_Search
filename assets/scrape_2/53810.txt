How to find the numerical positions of objects in the sky?

How do star locator applications such as SkyGuide, SkySafari and Stellarium get the current and future positions of
moons, planets, stars and artificial satellites in the sky?
Is there a public database that keeps track of all the positions of celestial objects in the sky that they call access to?
If so is there an API that can be interacted in JavaScript or Python?
For context Iâ€™m trying to make a website the tracks the positions of artificial satellites.
