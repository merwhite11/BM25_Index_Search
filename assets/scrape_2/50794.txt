What are the temperature and pressure requirements to fuse hydrogen and deuterium in Jupiter?

I've done some Google research to find out.
All found sources approached the question from a mass viewpoint. That is, Jupiter has to be about 70 - 80 times more massive to be a red dwarf (through hydrogen fusion) or 13 times more massive to be a brown dwarf (through deuterium fusion).
If Jupiter was somehow given the critical mass it needs to initiate thermonuclear fusion, how hot would it be and how much pressure would it have right before fusion starts?
According to this, the minimum temperature required for hydrogen fusion is 100 million kelvin.
If Jupiter's critical mass to fuse hydrogen was met, does this automatically mean its temperature would be 100 million Kelvin? And what about its pressure?
