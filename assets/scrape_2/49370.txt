How could I see Andromeda as large as in this picture?

In this question an image is shown (repeated below) which gives an idea of the "true" angular extent of the Andromeda galaxy in our sky.
When I see Andromeda it is usually a bit of a smudge perhaps the size of the full moon, presumably because I cannot see much beyond the bright nucleus and bulge of the galaxy.
Being a stellar astronomer, I have never thought much about the practicalities of seeing extended objects in the night sky.
My question is: what kind of observing conditions would allow me to see Andromeda with an angular size of $\sim 5$ degrees? Would it be sufficient to get to a really dark site with the naked eye, or would I also need to be looking for it with binoculars or a telescope? Or is it something where you must take a picture and do some processing to eliminate the general sky background?
EDIT: To be clear, I don't want my question reading back to me - as in "you can only see a smudge with the naked eye"; what I want to know is the observational conditions/instrument I need to able to see a several degree diameter Andromeda galaxy; preferably with the evidence?
