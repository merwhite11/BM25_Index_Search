Would a naked eye supernova become a disc in a matter of days?

Stars are points of light even in telescopes- if they go supernova, their diameter does expand, but given the distance of even nearby stars, they would still be points of light, I suppose?
I am asking because this video suggests that a very large disc would be seen in the sky after a few days if Betelgeuse were to go supernova. How long would it take for us to see a disc instead of a bright spot?
