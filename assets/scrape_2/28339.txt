In astronomy Is there a name for the exact time between solar noon and sunset?

Like there are names for various events such as sunset, sunrise, solar noon, solar midnight, astro, nautical and civil twilight, what exactly is name for time between sunset and solar noon. Afternoon it is but what exactly between these two points? Is golden hour the only subcategory for the afternoon? 
I did come across the word midafternoon. similarly, midnight, midmorning and midevening. but then again midafternoon would mean 3 o clock or does it mean point between solar noon and sunset? because midnight in general is more acceptable as 12 o clock. is it?
