Why is the Cosmic Microwave Background evidence of a hotter, denser early Universe?

In his book Gravitation and cosmology, Steven Weinberg says that CMB makes it  "difficult to doubt that the universe has evolved from a hotter, denser early stage".
In my understanding, the CMB is just a peculiar isotropic radiation representing a black body at ~ 2.7K.
How and why does CMB point to the early Universe being hotter and denser?
