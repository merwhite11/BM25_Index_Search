Do we still use the term "astronomical unit" nowadays?

An astronomical unit is defined as the measurement of distance between Earth and our Sun, my question is since distances between celestial objects beyond our solar system are vast and unimaginable astronomer adopted another familiar term "light-year" instead. My question is do people still use astronomical unit in the present days?
