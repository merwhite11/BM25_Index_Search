Why weren't Lunar meteorites identified until 1982?

According to Wikipedia the first meteorite of Lunar origin wasn't identified until 1982. Today 306 Lunar meteorites have been identified.

Why weren't they identified as Lunar already a decade earlier, when
the Apollo samples had been analyzed?
How do Lunar meteorites differ, the Lunar surface consists of
meteoroid material anyway?
Were there suggestions before 1982 that certain meteorites were of
Lunar origin, and did they turn out to be correct?
