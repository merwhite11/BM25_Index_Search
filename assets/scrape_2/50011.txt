Is there anything currently 46 billion light years away from Earth that we can see?

If the oldest galaxy ever discovered, i.e  GLASS-z13, is at a present proper distance of around 33 billion ly from Earth, why then do we define the observable universe to have a radius of around 46 billion ly? Is there anything currently 46 billion ly away from Earth that we can see?
