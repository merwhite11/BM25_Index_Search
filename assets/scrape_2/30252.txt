Is the delay to correlate the signal from one dish to another on a VLA radio telescope longer for red shifted objects?

When observing 2 objects side by side close to the horizon with a very large array, one receding fast & red shifted, is the delay to correlate the signal from the closest dishes to the further ones longer for the red shifted object?
