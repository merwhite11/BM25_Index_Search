What would happen if a star passed through the barycenter of two binary stars?

I was doing some research on Alpha Centauri A and B, and thought to myself: 'What would happen if something passed directly through the barycenter of these two stars?' I may theorise that a passing star will offset the barycenter with its gravity, sending the two stars in whatever direction it would go. I am not certain about this, nor am I certain that anyone has the answer. But if they do, please answer, I'd really like to know!
