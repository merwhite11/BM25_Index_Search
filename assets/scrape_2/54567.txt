I have access to a planetarium, how to make a video for it?

I have access to a planetarium. And am very excited to try making some video that can be played inside this dome. Can you give some directions? It has about 6 projectors. I dont know what is the video format? or file format used? or how to sync it? what softwares help in this? Is everything propreitory? Is everything tied to the make and model of the machine? Thanks a lot.
