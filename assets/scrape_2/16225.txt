Can a gas giant be hollow?

Let's think of Saturn, because of its density. Can there be a place near the center of the planet where the gravity upwards is more than towards the center, and with an atmosphere that is more suitable for life. 
Yes, I am calling the hollow Earth extreme, but is it that for a giant gas planet too. Can it be possible?
