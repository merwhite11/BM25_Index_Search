How can I determine a planet's orbital size if it is moving around an oscillating star?

I'd like to know how to calculate the size of the planet's orbit, given that it is the only one orbiting around a star, and that this star is oscillating with an amplitud of 0.026'' in 25 year periods. (The star is located at 1.83 pc from observer and has a given mass M). Also, the star is oscillating due to the planet.
