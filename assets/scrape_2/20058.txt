Where do rocks come from?

Consider a loose pile of rocks in an early solar system, say a tiny asteroid. As it accretes more and more material, the pressure at its center eventually becomes great enough to collapse the gaps between the rocks, which further increases the density, which increases the gravitational force, ... which leads to a runaway process that compacts a loose pile of rubble into a near-spherical body of almost solid rock.  (And some ices and liquids.)
But where do the rocks themselves come from?  Surely at least that much pressure is needed to fuse dust into macroscopic rocks?  Why isn't this a chicken-and-egg problem?
