Is there a chance that UFOs could be messages from other planets?

Description
Lots of people have thought to of seen UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects), in fact, more than 83,000 have been reported this year alone. (and it's only February!) But most of the time it's just a shooting star or an airplane. But some of the sightings don't seem to be any of the things a UFO is commonly mistook for, but there isn't any evidence supporting if it is really a UFO. I might not be alone on this theory, but I believe the sightings that potentially could be UFOs are messages from the cosmos.
Question
There may not be much to back up my theory, but I just wish to learn some background knowledge:

Are UFOs (and I guess all the UFO sightings reported, too) messages from another planet?

I also believe that if they are messages, they could possibly be responses to NASA's Voyager spacecrafts, for their purposes were to inform any forms of life out in space what earth is like with the 'Sounds of Earth' music disk attached to it.
