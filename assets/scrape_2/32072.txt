What was the composition of the primordial asteroid belt?

According to one theory, the region between Mars and Jupiter was once populated by several primordial planets with a combined mass of roughly the earth.  These planets provided the material that made up the original asteroid belt.  Since then, 99.9% of this material was lost.  The current composition of the asteroid belt is about 10% metallic and 90% silicate/carbonaceous.  Could we assume that the original asteroid belt had the same composition?  Or, at least a very similar composition?
