How to view Jupiter with 4.5" Newtonian Reflector

I have a 4.5" Newtonian Reflector and I took a look at Jupiter the other night.
I was able to get a reasonably sharp view of it and see a number of it's moons, but I was unable to see any surface details, it was pretty much just white glare.
I'm not sure if it's possible to distinguish any surface details with the telescope I have, so any advice on best setup would be useful.
I have a few accessories:

x2 barlow lense
10mm eye piece
25mm eye piece
6mm eye piece
moon filter
color filters

Would anything else, other than a more powerful telescope, help me?
I was unsure if I might have an alignment issue that was causing this, but as I could make out the moons as sharp dots on the planetary plane, I assumed not.
Any advice would be welcomed.
