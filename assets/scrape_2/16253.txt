Which astronomical objects do we have images of, taken at ground level?

I am looking for images of astronomical objects taken at the ground level of the actual object, by something on the actual object, i.e. the Mars Rover.
Is this the complete list and accurate?.

Earth
Mars
Titan
Venus
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
Moon

(I am not interested in images of objects take from the ground level of Earth).
