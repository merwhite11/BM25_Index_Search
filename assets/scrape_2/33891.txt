Force exerted by space debris on satellites

Hypothetically, if space debris were to collide with the currently orbiting satellites, how much force would they exert, and how much damage would they make?
Will the satellites be able to withstand that much force, especially if they don't have Whipple shields?
Since space debris travel at tremendous velocities, I am guessing the force is pretty large too. How do you calculate the force? Is it a simple $\rm{F=m \cdot a}$ calculation?
