What do "P" and "F" mean in the compass legend of Carrington's sunspot drawing?

In Richard Carrington's drawing of sunspots, he has a compass labeled "N", "P", "S", and "F". If "N" is North and "S" is South, what do "P" and "F" mean?
Also, why is the compass not oriented in the same way as the lines of longitude/latitude?
