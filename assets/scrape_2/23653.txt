false to stable vacuum transition

if the universe transitioned from a meta-stable vacuum to a stable vacuum we assume a universal death scenario. However since it cannot propagate faster than the speed of light, from any particular starting point, the universal expansion has crossed an intrinsic "event horizon" so how can this actually happen in any conceivable time scale?
