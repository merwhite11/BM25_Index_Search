Time of comet at perihelion query

In Practical Astronomy With Your Calculator Or Spreadsheet by Duffett-Smith and Zwart, the authors write (in relation to calculating cometary positions):

The longitude of the comet is not usually specified at a particular
epoch. Rather, the epoch is given when the comet is at perihelion, the
point of its closest approach to the Sun.

Why is this? Is time of perihelion easier to measure than longitude at a particular epoch?
