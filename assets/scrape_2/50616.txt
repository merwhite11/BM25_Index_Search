Stellar aberration without relative motion between source and observer

According to SR, there should be no aberration if source and observer move uniformely (as would be the case in terrestrial aberration). In this case we should find at least some celestial bodies that show no aberration at all, while moving by chance uniformely witht earth. Was ever any celestial body found out there, that does not underlay aberration?
I would be very happy to receive some answers,
