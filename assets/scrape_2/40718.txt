Is there a retrograde star that passes closer to the galactic center than our Sun?

Our Sun is moving in a prograde orbit around the galactic center with a distance of about 8 kpc.  This paper says there are many retrograde stars in the galactic halo 10-20 kpc from the galactic center.  Do any of these retrograde stars have an extremely eccentric orbit that would cause them to pass closer to the galactic center than our Sun?
