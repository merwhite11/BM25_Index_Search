Is Jupiter's Red Spot "locked in place" or does it move around?

A person could be forgiven when looking at Jupiter's Red Spot storm for concluding that it doesn't move. That it's geologically locked in place. But is it?
I know it's a stretch to use the phrase "geologically locked in place" when referring to a gas giant. So let me ask the question in a little different way.
As we observe Jupiter's rotation, does the storm show up in the very same spot on each rotation or does the spot move around, sometimes appearing more quickly on one rotation and later on the next? I suspect that the Red Spot can't move latitudinaly as it's likely bound to the band of turbulence it's in. But can it move "longitudinally" within that band or does it literally stay in one place, facing the Sun every 9 hours and 50 minutes (assuming it's equatorial, you get my point) like clockwork?
