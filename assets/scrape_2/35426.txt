Volume of Galaxies

Pretty much awkward question though. I would like to ask how is the volume of a Galaxy X is measured? For example consider milky way, what are the techniques to measure the same? How accurate and precise are the obtained results? What instruments are used for the same? When was this techniques developed? What are he beneficial outcomes of determining the GALAXIES' volume?
