Orange light in sky

It is 1:15 am, 8/10/18 in Indiana. I looked out my kitchen window and saw an orange light to the north with the color of a street light but clearly out in space.  It was about as high as a full moon at 10pm in July. It must be a planet... Anybody know which one? Thanks for your time.
