When did scientists discover that the Sun has a life cycle and that it is going to die?

I have been researching the history of scientific studies about the the Sun. However I have been unable to find out much information about how the scientific consensus started forming around stars' life cycles.
I know that it has been known since Galileo that some star have sudden changes in luminosity during their life. But I was unable to find out when scientists actually discovered that stars are born and die, and especially how this influenced the view on the future of the Solar System.
I suppose this happened somewhere at the start of the 20th century, when more information and research about supernovae was being found, but I couldn't find more precise information about it.
Any more precise information about this is greatly appreciated.
