Is TESS replaceable by gound-based-small-telescope arrays?

TESS is designed to perform an all-sky transiting exoplanet survey.

TESS's survey will focus on nearby G, K and M type stars with apparent
  magnitudes brighter than magnitude 12. Approximately 500,000 stars will
  be studied, including the 1,000 closest red dwarfs.

Since its targets are very bright and its sensitivity is relatively worse than Kepler, I wonder whether it can be replaced by gound-based-small-telescope arrays. There can be no gaps in the time series too.
