What would happen if a Sun-like star were to consume a Jupiter-like planet?

A substantial number of discovered exoplanet systems are likely contain more than one gas giant with distances far closer to the star than in our solar system.
It is known that in solar system evolution gravitational effects between objects can lead to some of them migrating outwards while others migrate inwards.
Has there been any study of what happens when a gas giant approaches its star close enough to start losing mass to it? In this case could the planet end up completely in the star?
For the purposes of this question let's choose a solar-mass G-type star and a gas giant such as Jupiter, since we have so much first-hand knowledge of these objects.
Jupiter has plenty of hydrogen and this would represent the addition of more nucleosynthetic fuel.
Would this be enough to cause the Sun to become the red giant in this case?
