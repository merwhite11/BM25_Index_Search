Why do black holes have jets and accretion disks?

If supermassive black holes possess the gravity required to prevent the escape of photons and other mass particles, why do jets and accretion disks form? 
They seem to indicate that something is coming out of the black hole, while mathematics and physics seem to tell us that this is impossible.
It would seem that supermassive black holes only exert gravity towards themselves.
