3-sphere universe

I have just read on this site that there is a Newtonian solution to Einstein's field equation but that it is spherically symmetrical and therefore not isotropic (having a centre for example) and so considered not allowed. But if the universe is a 3-sphere it could be both spherically symmetric and isotropic. Would the Newtonian solution then be a possibility?
