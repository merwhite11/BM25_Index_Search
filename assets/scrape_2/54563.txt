How do we get -0.4 mJy/beam in the the 1.28 GHz MeerKAT Galactic Center Mosaic?

Dr. Becky's Feb. 11, 2022 video Move over JWST! 5 new telescopes to get excited for makes a quick mention of this image produced by the Meerkat array and published in Heywood et al. 2022 The 1.28 GHz MeerKAT Galactic Center Mosaic (also arXiv).
The caption of the mosaic begins:

Figure 1. The full MeerKAT total intensity mosaic, covering 6.5 square degrees of the Galactic center region at an angular resolution of 4". This is a linear mosaic formed from the 20 pointings described in Section 2, the centers of which are showning the figure as “+” markers. The image has dual color schemes, with a linear greyscale covering the faint end, and the heat map covering the bright end with a square-root stretch function. Pixel scales for the two colormaps are inset...

I noticed that the "linear greyscale covering the faint end" is centered on zero, and ranges from -0.4 to +0.4 mJy/beam.
Question: How do we get -0.4 mJy/beam? What does negative power mean in this context?
