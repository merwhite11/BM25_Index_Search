The exact definition of lunar eclipse

I was finding the definition of the lunar eclipse (in which the earth blocks the sunlight that comes to the moon), and I have found that it could be defined differently.
Definitions of lunar eclipse that differ:

A phenomenon in which the moon enters the earth's shadow when viewed from the earth and cannot be seen or is completely obscured.

An eclipse in which the moon appears darkened as it passes into the earth's shadow.


I think the second one is right, because even if the moon is blocked by earth, sunlight that has a long wavelength could reach the moon. And that's the cause of red moon while total lunar eclipse.
If the first definition is also right, in what situation can the moon be invisible from earth during lunar eclipse?
