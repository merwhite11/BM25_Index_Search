The Fermi paradox

Ok so I was reading about the Fermi paradox, assuming life will form and thrive where possible as soon as possible and there is a very probable chance many other earths formed would they have started to form around at the same time our earth started forming.  To be clear, another question is at what point in time in the universe after the big bang was life (exactly like ours) even possible?
