Why is the H-alpha line slightly shorter in wavelength (656.28 nm) in air than in vacuum (656.46 nm)? Shouldn't it be longer?

Perhaps this is a question better suited for Physics SE, but since the H-alpha line is so important in astronomy, I'm posting this here....
I would, naively, assume that wavelengths would be longer, not shorter, when traveling through media (other than the vacuum), but perhaps I am misunderstanding...
Are photons released by hydrogen atoms more energetic (shorter wavelength) when first emitted in a medium of air?
In other words, the light is not shortened (or lengthened) when traveling through a particular medium, like air, but is different to begin with?
Why would light be different in wavelength when first emitted in different media?
Is light sometimes weaker (longer wavelength) when first emitted by atoms or molecules in a non-vacuum?
I am befuddled....
