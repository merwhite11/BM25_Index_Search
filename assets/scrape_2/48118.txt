Satellite emitting x-rays?

On the local TV news, it was alleged that x-rays from some satellite could interfere with something on earth.  I didn't hear it but my wife thought they were talking about WiFi or internet or something like that.  (She's had people jobs, so technical details aren't her expertise.)
I know that more than one satellite is detecting x-rays.  Are there actually any emitting them?  If so, what could it interfere with?  (Perhaps the latter question belongs on Physics.)
