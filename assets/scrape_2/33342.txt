What is the intensity distribution of visible light over the solar disk?

What is the distribution of the visible spectrum over the solar disk?
Images of the Sun using the visible spectrum suggest that the light emmitted from the edge is almost equal to the light emmited from the center of the solar disk.
Is this correct and is there a scientific source that proves that? I was not able to find something citable.
