Transforming galactic coordinates in Cartesian coordinates better formula?

I found on your site a formula to make this conversion,

a person helped me to insert it in an excel of which I put you the link.

I use it in a video game called Elite Dangerous which I really like.
In this one you can use Cartesian coordinates to locate yourself, the developers have incorporated 150,000 irl stars which are placed in the right place, I find that huge.
I use an edsm site which pulls game data like galactic and cartesian coordinates. https://www.edsm.net/
So thanks to this formula I was able to find irl stars by using its galactic coordinates to find it in game.
Other stars were generated randomly and also have galactic and Cartesian coordinates, so I used the data retrieved from edsm to see if this formula could give me exactly the same results.
for example :
Beagle point is located at: -1111.5625 / -134.21875 / 65269.75
Galactic coordinates: R: 65,279.352 / l: 0.976 / b: -0.118
Deeli's point ( hip 7) is located at: -135.5 / -124.125 / -43.21875
Galactic coordinates: R: 188.773 / l: 107.690 / b: -41.112
The results are not identical but very similar, so I wondered which formula the developers had used and if I could find it or correct the one I used to achieve the same results.
I search an better formula.
Sorry if this seems strange to you, getting interested in this game made me interested in a lot of things in astronomy. I would like to learn and understand always more, even if I have very little notion in mathematics
Sorry for the syntax, English is not my native language
