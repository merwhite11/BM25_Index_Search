Is it possible to detect gravitational lensing of both light and gravitational waves originating from the same event?

Is it theoretically possible to detect gravitational lensing of both light and gravitational waves, when both originate from the same source/event (merger of two stellar black holes or merger of two neutron stars or merger of stellar black hole with the neutron star) when such merger is happening in neighboring to Milky Way galaxies and when both types of lensing are caused by the gravitational effect of the massive black hole located either in the center of that galaxy or the black hole of our Milky Way galaxy?
PS Though directional information contained in the captured time separated series of gravitational waves (together representing gravitational lensing of gravitational wave) is not accurate enough to corroborate directional information provided in observation of gravitational lensing of light in proving that both are generated by the same event, I am wondering whether calculation of the lensâ€™ mass done separately for both observed spacial displacement (in case of gravitational lensing of light) and registered timing intervals (in case of gravitational lensing of gravitational wave), showing that the mass obtained in both types of calculation is about the same, - would provide more or less enough evidence to conclude with some level of confidence that both, gravitational lensing of light and gravitational lensing of gravitational wave are generated by the same event?
