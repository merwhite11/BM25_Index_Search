A camera and time dilation?

If I travelled near a black hole, my time would progress slower relative to someone on Earth. This is clear enough. However, what if we sent a probe with a camera to a black hole? When we watch the screen, would we see time through the camera's perspective â€” that is, would the Universe appear to progress faster as the probe got closer and closer to the black hole?
