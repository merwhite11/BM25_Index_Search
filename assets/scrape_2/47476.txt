At what time of the day of autumnal equinox the Sun's equatorial coordinates reach max value?

I'm trying to solve this task:

At what point in time of autumnal equinox day, at sunrise or sunset will
a) the declination of the Sun
b) the right ascension of the Sun
reach the maximum value?

I'm not really sure how they change during the day and how it differs on the autumnal equinox day. Any ideas?
