Can space-time expansion destroy light?

I know that light shifts from high frequency(like gama rays) to low frequency (like radio waves) when traveling throw a gravitational field, this is called red shifting.
My question is: Is there a limit to this, what happens to the light wave when it can no longer stretch, does it get destroyed ?
Thanks, and sorry for the dumb question, just curios.
Edit:
From my knowledge and the internet :) Electromagnetic spectrum it states that light is an electromagnetic wavelength and the frequency which the wavelength travels up and down and the distance it's travel it's called spectrum and in that spectrum there is a frequency that is visible to us, but the spectrum is very large, my question is just for curiosity, I want to know if we know what happens when the light gets beyond the spectrum, can it? And I know that the expanding of space-time makes the light stretch from a high frequency spectrum to a low one, but what happens when you go to the limit of the spectrum ? can the wavelength be stretch to the point of "breaking" ?
