Could a super Jovian planet have mild radiation belts?

Will a large gas giant always have powerful radiation belts or could a milder radiation environment exist even around super Jovian planets? I know Jupiter’s radiation belts are so strong due to a combination of the strength of its magnetic field, the source of particles from Io, and its own atmosphere. On a large gas giant with no close-orbiting large moon/Io analogue, and a slower rotation, could the magnetic field and radiation belts be more mild? I’m wondering about the potential habitability of a large exomoon orbiting a Super Jovian planet (super Jovian, because a more massive gas giant is more likely to form a more massive moon) in the habitable zone of its star.
