Can we manipulate cosmic rays?

Is it possible to send data using cosmic rays? 
Like sending high and low energy cosmic rays, since they can travel farther. And this data can be converted to binary form that can be processed by computers.
I'm not an astronomer or studied any thing related to astronomy, I was just imagining if this is possible.
