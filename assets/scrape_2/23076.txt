What's the color of Upsilon Scorpii?

I was looking at the constellation Scorpius the other day, and noticed that the last star in the tail (the telson's tip) -- known as Upsilon Scorpii, Ï… Scorpii, or Lesath -- seemed yet more red than the "heart" of the scorpion -- Antares or Alpha Scorpii. Was it that I was drunk, or some kind of sky pollution? (Actually, a friend confirmed it was red, and she seemed sober than me.) Or is it, indeed, red? I couldn't find any information on-line. I saw this database, but don't know how to find a star by its name, or if they have information about the color.
