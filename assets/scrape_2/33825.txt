Are there any galaxies visible in the night sky around the Orion constellation?

I'm writing a story for NaNoWriMo, and in it there is an extraterrestrial race whose home galaxy is visible from Earth. This home galaxy is visible (or even partially visible or barely visible) in the night sky as a close neighbor to the Orion constellation. "Close neighbor", as in "within or around" the Orion constellation. 
Is there any such galaxy?
