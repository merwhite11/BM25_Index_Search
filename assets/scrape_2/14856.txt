Do stars tend to fuse all hydrogen even when the mass is small?

Suppose a brown dwarf requires only one more hydrogen atom to become massive enough to start fusion, what will happen if we add a hydrogen atom to it?

It fuses until the mass is dropped and then fusion stops suddenly
It starts to fuse until all hydrogen use up

Which one is correct?
