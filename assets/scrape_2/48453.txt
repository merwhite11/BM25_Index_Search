Why does the gas cloud collapse in regions of high density?

Stars form when gas cloud collapse under gravity, becoming hot and subsequently initiating nuclear fusion. I have read that the collapse is triggered by density fluctuations, where regions of high density accumulate mass and then collapse? Why is that the case? When we say regions of high density, what does it mean? That they are regions where there are more gas particles? If that is the case, it should have more pressure and since particles move from high pressure to low pressure areas, accumulation of mass shouldn't happen right? Am I missing something here ?
