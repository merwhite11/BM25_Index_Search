What are the blue "stars"?

From NASA September 16 Hubble studies a spectacular spiral:

There are 4 really bright blue stars in this photo of galaxy NGC 1961. For those who can't see them very clearly, you can focus on the furthest top right one.
Is it a type O star as its blue? They seem much brighter than any other stars and are further away from the galaxy too.
