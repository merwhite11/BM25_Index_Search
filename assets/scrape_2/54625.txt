Stellarium and the Taurids

Hi I am running Stellarium 23.2
Meteor showers only appear on the dates they should be visible in the sky
I set the date as -9800 (9800BC) and I see the Taurids appear in Gregorian date May/June.
In -4500 they are in July
Is this due to orbital changes over time, such as orbital precession, or is there an error of some kind?
I have checked the solstice date in 9800BC and that looks OK(ish)
So in -9800 I have the Taurids at the time of the summer solstice

Think I have my answer - the radiant point does precess
