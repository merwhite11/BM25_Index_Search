How Wide Would the Habitable Zone Be in a Singular Red Giant System?

Astrobiologists looking for signs of life outside Earth usually take excitement over planets orbiting red giant stars because a larger, brighter star usually means a farther-away but still wider habitable zone, a slice of space where liquid water would be possible.
To put this in perspective, a single red giant can have a luminosity ranging anywhere between 1,000 and 10,000 times brighter than our sun.  Would that mean that a habitable zone in a solar system orbiting only one red giant would be 1,000 to 10,000 times as wide as our own?
