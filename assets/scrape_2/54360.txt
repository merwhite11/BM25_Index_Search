Does rotation on their axis cause winds in gaseous planets?

As far as I know, as planets rotate around their axis, they can influence winds but not cause them (like the Coriolis effect)
However, does this apply only for rocky planets? Do rotation alone in gaseous planets contribute to their winds?
I am asking this because of this question (https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/123419/how-can-a-remote-planet-with-little-to-no-sunlight-have-high-wind-speeds) where one answer seems to imply that rotation in gaseous planets is one direct cause of their winds (while in rocky planets it is not). Is this true?
