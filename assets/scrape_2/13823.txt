Does natural satellite(s) of a planet affects its orbital velocity around a star?

Please excuse me for a lay question. 
As we know, to calculate the orbital velocity, we take the mass of the orbiting body, the mass of the body being orbited and the distance between the two bodies into account. 
However, we don't really care about the natural satellite(s) (of a planet) in the calculations. Why are they insignificant? Why isn't the whole system involved in the calculations?
