What Simple and Multiple Linear and Logistic Regressions Would Be Valuable for a Celestial Mechanical Data Set for Exoplanets with Density?

I have created a celestial mechanical data set for exoplanets with density values (https://github.com/tslever/Tom_Levers_Git_Repository/blob/main/UVA/2--Linear_Models_For_Data_Science/Project_2/Data_For_Exoplanets_With_Density.csv) based on the NASA Exoplanets Archive's Planetary Systems data set (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS&constraint=default_flag%20%3E0) and Exoplanet Catalog  (https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/discovery/exoplanet-catalog/).
Below is a graph of Density vs. Orbital Semimajor Axis. What are your thoughts of normalizing orbital semimajor axis by stellar surface gravity, for example, for the purpose of mathematically aligning a planetary system with Earth's solar system? What insights do you glean from this graph?
What simple and multiple regressions would be valuable with number of stars, number of planets, number of moons, circumbinary status, orbital semimajor axis, radius, mass, density, eccentricity, insolation flux, equilibrium temperature, spectral type, stellar mass, stellar luminosity, stellar surface gravity, and/or type (terrestrial / non-terrestrial)?
