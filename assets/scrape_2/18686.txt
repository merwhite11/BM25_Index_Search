Why are galaxies distributed as walls and voids, or spider webs?

I have wondered why the "walls and voids" of the cosmological galaxy distribution seem to resemble a "foam", like rising bread that's ready to fall, with "voids" corresponding to empty bubbles in the foam. James K and Rob Jeffers https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/18610/14485 seem to be saying local matter tends to relatively "overrule" the cosmological expansion, and that the bubbles ("voids") get relatively more cosmic expansion. This may explain the "foam" appearance: local large areas of slightly lower relative galaxy density will tend to cosmic expansion more, and will grow (less dense) more than denser regions, like bubbles in the foam, effectively driving all the galaxies into the walls between the bubbles.
