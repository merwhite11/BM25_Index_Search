What were the odds that ʻOumuamua passed so close to the Sun?

ʻOumuamua passed its closest point at about 0.25 UA from the Sun.
Has anyone researched what the odds were that the first ever spotted interstellar object passed so close to the Sun?
Being the interstellar space almost totally empty, I would intuitively suppose that such odds would be extremely low.
