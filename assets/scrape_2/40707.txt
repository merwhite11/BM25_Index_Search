Current best-known Drake Equation values?

Frank Drake's equation is used to estimate $N$ the number of civilizations we might be able to communicate with in our galaxy:
$$N = R_\star f_p n_e f_l f_i f_c L$$
where:
$R_\star$ is the average rate of star formation in the galaxy
$f_p$ is the fraction of stars with planets
$n_e$ is the average number of goldilocks planets per planetary system
$f_l$ is the fraction of goldilocks planets that actually develop life
$f_i$ is the fraction of life bearing planets that develop intelligent life
$f_c$ is the fraction of civilizations that broadcast their existence into space
and $L$ is the length of time for which a civilization broadcasts their existence
Question
Have the many exoplanets we've discovered in the last several decades improved our estimates of $f_p$, and $n_e$?  Are these values different than what was guessed about prior to the discovery of the first exoplanets?  What is our current best estimate for $R_\star$ for the Milky Way?
