Is it safe to view a solar eclipse with eyeglasses along with eclipse glasses?

In an article on Ars Technica about safely viewing a solar eclipse, they say this:

First, what not to do: Don’t view the eclipse with your naked eye or unfiltered telescopes, binoculars, sunglasses (yeah, even if they’re really dark), camera lenses, or other optics devices. Don’t use anything that focuses light, even if you’re wearing eclipse glasses.

This may sound like a stupid question, but are eyeglasses (by which I mean, lenses to correct poor vision) safe to wear during an eclipse along with eclipse glasses? I don't know if the light focusing is strong enough to be concerned about.
