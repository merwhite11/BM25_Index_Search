Most time dilation possible outside of the event horizon?

What is the most time dilation possible outside of the event horizon of a black hole with the reference to us?
I know that time dilation is stronger if you are near an extreme amout of mass. It is also important how close you are to this mass.
So my first thought was: more massive black hole = more time dilation. But if a black hole gets more massive, the event horizon will also get bigger so you would also have to move away from the singularity. So more mass = more distance to the mass. Less mass = less distance to the mass.
Also: I don't need to survive this or having a stable orbit. Let's say I can just hover at a fixed distance from the event horizon with a timer equiped.
So my question again: What would be the greatest time dilation possible outside of the event horizon? If 1 minute has passed on earth, how many secound would have passed on a watch on the position of greatest time dilation if I look through an telescope with infinit resolution? (Also to counter the effect of lightspeed limitation, I start the timer on earth when I see that the timer on this position is startet)
