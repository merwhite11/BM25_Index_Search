Density of hydrogen between galaxies

From watching a video on youtube, it states that Dark Matter is 6 times more abundant than known matter. I was wondering if it was possible to have hydrogen clouds between the universes galaxies. The density would need to be less than inside universes galaxies (since star formation would be possible). 
Is it possible that hydrogen clouds be a major component of Dark Matter?
