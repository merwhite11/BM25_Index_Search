How does a spinning black hole affect space-time compared to a non-spinning black hole?

I often see questions on this site that only apply to non-spinning black holes and often wonder how the answer would be different for a spinning black hole.  As the title says, what are the major differences between the behavior of spinning and non-spinning black holes, especially when it comes to the effect on space-time?
