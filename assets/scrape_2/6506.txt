What is it like at the edge of the universe?

If the universe is expanding, then if you were to be close to the edge of that expansion, what would it look like? What would be happening? Would it be chaotic? Would objects be appearing or disappearing? I don't even know if it's possible to have any knowledge of this, but I'd like to know if there are any theories.
