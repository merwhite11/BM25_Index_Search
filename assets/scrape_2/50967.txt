What was this shooting star that I saw 2 nights ago that traveled south to north at approximately eye level?

For about 2 weeks I have been observing the night sky hoping to see shooting stars. I have seen many during this 2 weeks but 2 nights ago I saw what I believe was a shooting star but it traveled from south to north at about eye level maybe 10 ft in front of me. I’m very sure about that distance because it was between myself and a utility building.
I would describe the "shooting star" as looking like a cheap Roman candle in that it was not moving very fast and it was not particularly bright or colorful. I would estimate the size of it to be much smaller than my hand and it seemed to be surrounded by “vapor” as well as a trail of vapor less than 12 inches long. On one other night I saw another one that was much less impressive that also traveled from south to north below the height of a bird house for “purple Martin birds” I believe the minimum recommended height for these is 30 feet. I would appreciate any information as I found it to be a fascinating experience.
