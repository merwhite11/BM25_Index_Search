Cluster of fast moving stars

We live in NW Tasmania in a country town and tonight out walking I pointed out a long cluster of stars to my sister as they made an unusual shape but then we realised they were moving really fast - we stood and watched them pass over us and decided to record it but sadly the moon was too bright to get  a good recording. Any ideas on what it was? very intrigued as haven't seen anything like it before.
