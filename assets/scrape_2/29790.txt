Can Earth be ejected out of the solar system this way?

I found this image of what maybe a model of our solar system. Without a credible source I'm not sure I am looking at a star or black hole that comes close to our solar system and how it could throw Earth out of orbit from the sun and/or solar system?  
I found it while Googling for how a solar system travels through space and did a picture search with no luck.
Is this possible? And what am I looking at?
