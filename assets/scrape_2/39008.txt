Is there a name for a planet and its moons/satellites?

I'm wondering if there's a name that encapsulates the concept of a planet and the objects that orbit in its gravity. There's a solar system that encapsulates a star and its multiple planets and other objects, but I don't think that "solar system" describes the Earth and its moon, or Jupiter and it's many moons, for example.
