Is Earth losing orbit?

Is the Earth losing or gaining distance from the sun overall? Could asteroids over time add weight to the Earth and push it farther from the sun more than having a degrading orbit around the sun? Does asteroids and space dust increase the mass the the outer planets over sustaining or pulling the Earth from the Sun?
