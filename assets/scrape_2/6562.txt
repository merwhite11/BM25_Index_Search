Does the radius of the Universe correspond to its total entropy?

I heard a claim that due to holographic principle, the surface area of the cosmic horizon corresponds to the universe's total entropy.
As such the initial state had zero surface area and later expanded.
Given this, I wonder whether any increase in entropy (such as producing heat by means of electric power) causes the universe to expand?
