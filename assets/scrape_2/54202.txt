What is the "structure" of the Solar System while traveling through Space?



On the Image above, the arrows pointing upwards depict Solar System's travel direction. The arrows pointing to the right show its own direction of rotation and the direction of the planets within it revolving around the Sun.
The big circles are the Sun and the stripes are its differential rotation. 
Is any of the two examples above correct?
