Identify this object

I observed this when I was playing around with an amateur (crappy) telescope. The picture was taken using a dslr attached to the telescope.
It was taken in San Francisco on 2015-01-20. I don't remember the direction but I would guess it was pointing East-South East - that's the only direction which has a clear visibility from where I took this.
Could anyone identify what I am looking at here? 

Note:  I'm not discounting the fact that it could have been an aberration in the telescope or the camera.
