How many science instruments can be used in parallel with the Hubble Space Telescope?

The Hubble Space Telescope offers a parallel obervation mode. Observing programmes such as CANDELS and CLASH use WFC3 and ACS in parallel fields. These are also the only instruments of which I have heard that they are being used in parallel. Here are my questions:
Is it possible to observe with more than two instruments in parallel? If so, what is the limit, and why?
Why aren't all observations done with as many instruments as possible turned on?  Granted, a lot of the data would be useless / difficult to analyze (like spectra of a random patch of sky), but on the other hand it might lead to serendipitous discoveries. HST won't last forever, so why not get the most use possible out of it?
Note that this is about the science instruments - I assume the guidance sensors will be working alongside the others anyway. (Or is that wrong?)
