Status of new telescopes on Mauna Kea?

I know that there has been conflicts between scientists and the native population. Astronomers want to build new telescopes on Mauna Kea, however, several sacred sites would have to be built on.
My question is, are there any current plans to move forward with the observatories, or have they reached a gridlock?
