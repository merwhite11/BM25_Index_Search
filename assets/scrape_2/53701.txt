Can someone explain the strange case of NGC 4319 and Markarian 205 and its controversial redshifts and later convinced by reddening?

When they saw in neutral hydrogen wavelength they saw a neutral hydrogen bridge, while the Hubble Space Telescope concluded that the light from the quasar was redshifted. So if it's redshifted, how can a quasar be so near to earth? When the distances were measured the quasar was 1 billion light years away and NGC 4319 was 77 million times near so Mk205 is 14 times away from NGC 4319. Then how can there be a neutral hydrogen bridge between those two galaxies?
