How far apart has the sun drifted from Alpha Centari due to the expansion of the universe since its formation?

From what I read Alpha Centauri formed 250 million years before the sun which was 4.85 billion years. So how far apart were they when the sun formed vs what they are now?
The expansion of the universe must be contributing to it's 4.4 light years. But because they are so close together I am wondering if it is significant on such short scales?
