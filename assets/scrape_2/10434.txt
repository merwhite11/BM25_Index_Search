Is the sun too small to self-ignite?

I recently heard in a discussion that the sun is not massive enough to self-ignite via core-pressure. It simply has not enough mass to "generate" the gravitational force needed for that.
The reason why the sun is still burning is that there is a really small chance that two Hydrogen-Atoms fuse without needing the activation-energy/the activation-energy being provided by a random effect like High-Energy-Particles. Even though the chance is really low, there are so many Hydrogen-Atoms that overall the chance is actually high (law of big numbers). Once some fusion started it provides enough energy to fusion more Hydrogen, leading to our sun shining.

The person who presented it only stated that there are sources, but sadly the ones I found from his material didn't support this (nor did they deny it). The sources where about other topic related to stars. I can't ask the person himself as he already changed the university.
