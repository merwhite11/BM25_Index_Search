Black Holes emitting Hawking radiation

I've read that even light cannot escape from black holes.
The speed of light is theoretically predicted to be the escape velocity of a black hole.
I've also read that the general notion that nothing can escape from a black hole is wrong.  Even black holes emit particles and radiation known as the Hawking radiation.
My question is: How can black holes emit any kind of radiation?
If they even do emit, wouldn't the speed of the radiation be less than or equal to velocity of light?
If the escape velocity of a black hole is c, then how can the Hawking radiation even escape the black hole? Wouldn't it be pulled back into the black hole? Then, how is it even 
emitting anything?
