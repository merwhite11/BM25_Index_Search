Will all galaxies eventually become elliptical galaxies?

According to the Wikipedia article Elliptical galaxy, elliptical galaxies have a sparse interstellar medium. I know that probably sometimes two spiral galaxies collide then exponentially approach the state of being an elliptical galaxy. For a spiral galaxy that will never collide because if it hasn't collided before all the other galaxies went past its cosmic horizon, I wonder whether its interstellar medium will slowly get thinner until it's so thin that stars are no longer confined to the plane of the galaxy by friction and then as soon as a few of them start to go slightly outside the plane, they will bring with them their gravitational field causing stars to go further outside the plane and then after it gets wide enough, the interstellar medium will be even faster to get consumed by stars moving in random directions.
