Can satellites travel in clusters?

Last night we saw a large cluster of what looked like exceptionally bright stars that moved, as a group, across the night sky in Lancaster, PA. It was about 9:15 pm, and they moved roughly from SW to NE. There were 25 or 30 of them. They moved as quickly as a satellite I once saw, but were bigger and brighter. They were soundless and did not blink, and the relationships between the lights changed slightly as they moved.
We don't believe in UFOs, but can't we find any explanation via google. 
Can that many satellites move as a group?
