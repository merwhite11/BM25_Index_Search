How to find the constellation in which the sun is located using the night sky map?

The following sky map was given as part of practice problems in my Astronomy course

The moon is in its first quarter phase. I am supposed to find the approximate date and time of the year in which this photograph was taken. I am clueless as to how to proceed so any help is greatly appreciated. I am new to Astronomy StackExchange, and I apologize in advance if I have made any mistakes.
