If Jupiter would stop rotating, would its atmosphere become homogeneous and single coloured?

Looking at pictures of Jupiter, there are many different colours and patterns. I imagine that the rotation has much to do with this, since there are horizontal "bands" across the planet along the direction of rotation.
If the rotation would slow down and eventually stop, would the atmosphere get mixed and even out over time until we could only see a fuzzy brown (?) color but no color shifts or other patterns on the surface?
