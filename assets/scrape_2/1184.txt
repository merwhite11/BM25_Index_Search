Why don't we have 2 Summers and 2 Winters?

Due to Earth's elliptical orbit, its distance from Sun varies by almost 5 million Kilometers (147 million Kilometers at closest point & 152 million Kilometers at farthest point, i.e. almost 3% of the average distance).
As evident from the fact that that Venus has hotter environment than Mars due to their respective distances from the sun.
Why then Earth does not observe two winters (at farthest points) and two summers (at closest points)?
Additional Note:
I know that Earth's seasonal climate change is caused by its 23 degrees tilt that causes the sunlight density variations for the hemispheres.
But to me this 5 million Km distance seems more relevant than the 23 degrees tilt.
