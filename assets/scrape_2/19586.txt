Formation of "hot Jupiters" before star ignition

I'm watching a BBC special on the formation of solar systems, and they're covering the topic of "hot Jupiters" that exist near their host stars. The prevailing theory, according to this 2015 special, is that the planets form farther out, then migrate in. This addresses the issue of their gas being driven off by the host star. 
Isn't also possible that these planets formed shortly before the ignition of the host star? The mass that will form the star is already mostly collected, and could hold bodies in orbit, but the heat has yet to begin, and wouldn't drive off gas.
