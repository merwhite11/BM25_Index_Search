Exoplanets and relativity

Ok, so I have read about how exoplanets are found using all sorts of genius methods.  I also understand the further an obect in a telescope is the further into the past I am looking.  
So given that we are finding exoplantets with methods that go well beyond any practical visual range are we fnding these exoplanets 'in their past' as well? As far as I understand radio telescopes and other methods can't travel faster than light therfore their results are also from past events, is my reasoning in this right?
