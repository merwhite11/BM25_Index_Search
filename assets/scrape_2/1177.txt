How do we know that the intrinsic brightness of Cepheid variables corresponds to their period?

As I understand it, beyond parallax the next way of estimating the distance to astronomical objects is by using a relationship between the period and intrinsic luminosity of Cepheid variables.  How do we know that relationship?  Are there some close enough that we used parallax to validate it, or is there a theoretical reason, or something else?
