When will Callisto be in orbital resonance with the rest of Jupiter's big moons?

The four Gallilean moons of Jupiter (from innermost) are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.  Io, Europa, and Ganymede are in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance. Callisto's orbital period is 16.689 days, which is not much more than twice Ganymede's period of 7.1546 days.

If Jupiter's orbit around the Sun was stable, when could we expect Callisto to come into a 1:2:4:8 orbital resonance with the Jupiter's other Gallilean moons?
