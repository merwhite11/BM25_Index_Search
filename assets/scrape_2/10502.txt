Astronomical databases for machine learning?

I was reading this question about open problems in astronomy. The bounty-receiving answer says that 

I have just left the field where some colleagues are trying to develop some software to use image subtraction techniques to isolate individual stars in the centre of clusters.

I find this problem interesting. Where could I find databases of astronomical images for testing different kind of ML techniques to solve such problems?
