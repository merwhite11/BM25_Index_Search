Mass-age stellar phase diagram

The HR diagram is a sort-of "phase diagram" (in a very rough sense) for stars, where a particular star's location on the diagram says something about what "kind" of star it is.  However, because age is not on the axes of a HR diagram, stars trace out complex paths through it as they evolve.
For my purposes, I'd like to be able to very quickly reference what kind of star I'm looking at based on its age and mass.  I'm just trying to simulate more-or-less realistic stellar populations; I'm not doing research or anything and so I'm not really accounting for things like mass loss (or gain in binaries).  For this purpose it would be useful to have a "phase diagram" where age (perhaps relative to ZAMS) is on an axis, letting me use it as a sort of look-up table based on the mass of the star.  (Maybe it could also be 3D to include metallicity, but that could be a future step).  Ideally I'd just like to be realistic enough to capture different types of end-of-life behaviors (different types of giants, whether the star will go supernova or not, etc...)
I think this should be possible to do in principle using a stellar evolution code like MESA.  You'd need to define what you consider to be different "types" of stars and decide where to draw boundaries (maybe possible with something like k-means or support vector analysis?).  I've messed around with MESA-web a bit, but I'm no astrophysicist and I have no idea if I'm doing things right, e.g. if I'm picking sufficiently realistic nuclear reaction networks.
So, my question is: has anybody done something like this before, and/or is there some fundamental limitation to this approach that I don't know about?
