Could it have been possible for the Moon to be split without any observable effect on Earth?

Before asking my question, I'd like to clarify why I'm asking about something so absurd. A supersitious claim has been bought to me that in the past, the moon was split and seperated as a sign. My attempts at dissuading them by pointing out that half of the planet failed to observe it has been met with the reply that this is because it took place for a short period of time. After which ofcourse the moon was returned to it's original form, leaving no evidence :)
I would like to know if there would've been any effect observable on Earth resulting from such a massive body being split in two. Perhaps something to do with the effect of the sudden change in the Moon's gravity on earth? Or perhaps some other factor that would make such an act impossible?
