Requesting book references for a non-expert person with math background or just a non-expert person

I've just finished my masters degree (to be exact previous week ^_^). And I'm completing my collection of applications of my studies. During previous year I started reading about Robotics and Coding theory (but in free times as a hobby). I knew that my field of study has application in Astrophysics but I didn't have enough time to go after this topic as well. But my main question; these days I felt into mood of having a general knowledge in Astronomy etc. everything related to stars and space.
As I'm not seeking the application of my field of study at astrophysics (if I were it was better to put this question at math stack instead of hear) and certainly almost all members here are not familiar with pure mathematics, I will be pleased if someone here introduce one or several nice texts or books which satisfy one of the two following set of conditions:
1- Some elementary sources which people who doesn't have any background can read them. The notes be exciting and the reader wants to continue it until its end.
2- Sources which also use mathematics (specially if the level of the math won't be only some calculus) but the dominant text be about stars and space.
Assume you are suggesting a text to a person as his first thing he will read in this topic. And if you think a series or a number of texts are suitable, please give an order to which should be read first and then which for the next and so on.
(Also please note that I don't like to read guesses! So texts contains we guessed x should be because of y or we think the world is ... are not interesting to me)
Thank you for your attention.
