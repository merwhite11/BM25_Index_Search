At what point does an astronomical body's surface stop being gas giant-like and start being sun-like?

I've generally seen brown dwarfs depicted as more massive and slightly wider Jupiters in varying colors with banded cloud structures, sometimes hot enough to be visible glowing. I've also seen red dwarfs generally depicted as smaller and redder suns with sunspots and granules, and Wikipedia mentions that red dwarfs are prone to large starspots and flares. My question is where is the transition region between them and what happens there? Can there be brown dwarfs with starspots? Red dwarfs with bands?
