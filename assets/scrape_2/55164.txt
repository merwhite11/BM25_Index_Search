is there anything that might cause a planet to stop getting sunlight permanently, or to only have light infrequently? (on the whole planet or part)?

(writing a story)
Is there anything that might cause all or part of a planet to stop getting sunlight, or to have a permanent/ridiculously long-lasting perpetual twilight?
nuclear winter? volcanic winter? a change in rotation or axis tilt, or some kind of permanent eclipse (that one seems especially unlikely)?  maybe a more 'squashed' orbital path, or a super-duper slow planetary rotation?
or what about a day/night cycle on the order of years?
