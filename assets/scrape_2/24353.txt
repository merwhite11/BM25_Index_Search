Items at the Event Horizon vs. colliding Black Holes

Items reaching a Black Hole's Event Horizon seem to be frozen in time from the point of view of an outside observer. On the other hand, Black Holes collide and merge, in finite steps, producing gravitational waves observable to outside observers. How is it possible these two facts not to contradict each other?
