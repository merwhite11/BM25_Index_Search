Can a planet with no atmosphere be orbited at extremely low altitudes?

Can a planet that has absolutely no atmosphere be orbited by a spacecraft at extremely low "altitudes" (if you'd even call it altitude at such a low orbit.
For instance, if this planet's highest peak was 1km above sea level, could a spacecraft orbit this planet at 1.75km altitude? For sake of discussion the spacecraft can reach whatever speed necessary to stay in that orbit around that planet- regardless the size/radius.
Notes
1.) When I say no atmosphere- I mean literally like absolutely no atmosphere. Not even 1 single particle of air or gas of any type or element. Absolutely nothing that can cause any drag or force on the spacecraft
2.)As I mentioned earlier- lets just assume the speeds needed to orbit planet are attainable no matter how large or small this planet would be.
My guess:
Im no astrophysics guru but from what I've learned through my non-professional astronomy and astrophysics obsession is that, yes, it can be orbited.
But never mind what i think. I'd love for someone with he knowledge to tell me what are the facts here.
