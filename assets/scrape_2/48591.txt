The moon rises at a different time each day, but that difference changes. Why?

Let's say the moon rose at 5pm yesterday and 5:30pm today. The difference is 30 minutes â€“ but that difference changes from day to day and can be  anywhere between twenty-some to seventy-some minutes. It is also usually a different value than the difference in moonset time.
I plotted the progressions of the change in both over the course of 2022 (according to rise and set times given by timeanddate.com), and a pattern emerged:

(To be clear, this is a graph of the changes in rise and set time, not the actual rises and set times themselves.)
I'm curious as to what causes this pattern, why they mirror each other, and what causes the lull in the slope of each line. I thought it could be related to the moon's phase, but after adding the data for illumination, it seemed that there was no correlation.
