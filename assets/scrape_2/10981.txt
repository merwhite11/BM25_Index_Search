How do astronomers determine the texture of an exoplanet?

So I was wondering how astronomers are able to get the texture/detail of an exoplanet or how they know a planet has water or not.  I know how they discover planets by using the light of a star and seeing if it gets faint or by seeing if the star is getting gravitationaly pulled back and forth,  to determine the planet size. But I just don't understand how they are able to get the texture of a planet. Thanks for the help!
