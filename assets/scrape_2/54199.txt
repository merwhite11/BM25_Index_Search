How did the Cassiopeia A Supernova go unobserved?

The Cassiopeia A was caused by a Supernova estimated to have taken place around the late 17th century. The Remnant's declination means that it would be Circumpolar for anyone north of 30N, and it's further from the Galactic core then our solar system, which is important because the interstellar dust gets denser as you get nearer to the core, and less dense as you move away.
