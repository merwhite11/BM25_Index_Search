What percent of planets are in the position that they could be viewed edge-on from Earth? (and thus able to undergo transits)


Star number 12644769 from the Kepler Input Catalog was identified as
  an eclipsing binary with a 41-day period, from the detection of its
  mutual eclipses (9). Eclipses occur because the orbital plane of the
  stars is oriented nearly edge- on as viewed from Earth. During primary
  eclipses, the larger star, denoted “A,” is partially eclipsed by the
  smaller star “B,” and the system flux de- clines by about 13%

Here's the thing though: out of all possible edge-on configurations, there are far more configurations where a planet can never be in the position to be edge-on, rather than configurations where a planet could potentially be in the position to be edge on. (I'd guess that it happens in fewer than one in several hundred cases)
So why are we able to observe so many transits?
