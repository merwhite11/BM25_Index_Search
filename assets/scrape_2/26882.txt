What fractions of matter are retained and displaced by quasars?

Following on from a query concerning quasar mass, what fraction of matter is ejected compared to matter that is lost to the BH? 
Is there a graph that describes the fractions of the mass of quasars which contribute to disk radiation, plume radiation and black-hollowed? (sorry I can't think of a word because accretion and accretion disk is confusing)
