How to install the Barlow lens on this telescope?

I've brought a 4.5inch astronomical telescope recently which has an aperture of 114mm and a focal length of 1000mm, and two eyepieces. The two eyepieces were of 25mm and 10mm. I enjoyed stargazing using the 25mm eyepiece. But the stuff that I could see with my 25mm eyepiece was not visible through the powerful eyepiece. I'll post some pics. Can someone tell me how to install the Barlow lens?
