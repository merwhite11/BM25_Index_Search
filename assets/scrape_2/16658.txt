Is it possible that a star system ejects an object out of the galaxy?

I know it is possible that a star system ejects a planet out of the star system and the planets becomes rogue planets and orbit around the galaxy. Is it also possible that a planet gains enough speed because of ejecting and escapes out of the galaxy?
