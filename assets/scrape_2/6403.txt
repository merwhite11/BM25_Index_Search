Is there matter forming in the inflationary space?

Following the answers and the line of thinking from here Is there enough hydrogen left after a star dies so another star will have enough to light up?
I was wondering if is there any possibility to know if, where new space is created between the galaxies, is there also created any kind of new matter ( i.e. hydrogen, or subatomic particles that could eventually form atoms, which will lead to forming new stars and galaxies ) ?
