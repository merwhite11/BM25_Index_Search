Confirm: We can only notice planets if their orbit passes in front of their star and our view

If we can tell a planet exists by the dimming of the brightness of a star when it passes in front of our view of the star does that mean we cannot see a planet if it does not cross in front of our view? 
If planet of a distance star goes around the star rather than in front of it than we cannot see that planet. Correct?
