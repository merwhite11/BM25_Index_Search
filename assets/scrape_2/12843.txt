Can dark matter decrease the Jeans length?

I am wondering if there are any models of interstellar cloud collapse out there which take dark matter into account. 
If dark matter has local perturbations or density fluctuations, then that may be a large enough effect to cause collapse of an interstellar cloud. This might increase the mass and density of a cloud enough to overcome the kinetic energy of hydrogen atoms leading to collapse.
Are there dark matter density variations at the scale of interstellar clouds?
