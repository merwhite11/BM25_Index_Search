Our Solar System’s interstellar movement in relation to the Alpha Centauri System

Our solar system is moving at approx. 52,000 mph, so where is the Alpha Centauri system, which is assumed to be also moving through interstellar space at a similar velocity since it is part of our Galaxy. Is the A. Centauri system moving in front of us at 12 o’clock, parallel to us at 3 o’clock, or some other configuration?
