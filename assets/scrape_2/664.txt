Are we moving ever closer to the center of our Galaxy due to a super massive black hole?

I've seen in documentaries that at the center of each galaxy is a super massive black hole which holds the galaxy together. 
Since black holes have such a strong pull, are we slowly being pulled in closer and closer to this black hole?
