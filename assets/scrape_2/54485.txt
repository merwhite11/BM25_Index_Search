"Next Generation Arecibo Telescope (NGAT)... would combine a 314-metre-wide platform with a swarm of 9-metre dishes on top" What would that look like?

In Nature News' August 11, 2023 Closing down an icon: will Arecibo Observatory ever do science again? found in The Observatory there is discussion of the Next Generation Arecibo Telescope (NGAT):

Another, more distant hope is for the Next Generation Arecibo Telescope (NGAT) to be built at the site. After the 305-metre dish collapsed, some researchers who had used the site proposed NGAT, an instrument that would combine a 314-metre-wide platform with a swarm of 9-metre dishes on top of it.

What would a swarm of 9-meter dishes on top of a 314-metre-wide platform actually look like. Is the platform just for mechanical support of the "swarm" or is it also a dish reflector? Does this take advanage of the site's natural concavity, or is it something that could be put on flat ground anywhere, especially where the water vapor is lower?
