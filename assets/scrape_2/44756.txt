Can you compute the solar day?

For a given planet, if you know the sidereal rotation period and the sidereal revolution period, can you compute the length of one solar day?
For instance, for Earth, if you know one rotation is roughly 23h56m and one year is 365.25 days, can you recover that one solar day is 24 hours?
