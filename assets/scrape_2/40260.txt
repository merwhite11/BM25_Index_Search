Building a floating, ocean-going giant radio telescope?

Given the loss of the Arecibo telescope: Is anybody aware of any efforts or studies towards a floating, ocean-going radio telescope of with 500m diameter or more?
The idea is floating (pun intended) in my head since I heard about Japanese design studies about foldable aircraft carriers (actually it is just the runway which is expandable and thin).
In the age rockets self-landing on a small sea-born platform, I assume that we have the wave movements under control, at least in principle.

Could we carve a large radio dish in the Antarctic ice?
