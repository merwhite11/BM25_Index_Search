Has the Mars dust storm affected its naked-eye appearance?

Mars has been undergoing a planet-wide dust storm for a couple of months now.

By my eye, while Mars currently looks a bright and handsome orange, there's been no change that I've been able to notice from this dust storm. Is it possible for an experienced naked-eye (or small telescope) astronomer to have noticed the change in appearance brought on by this dust storm?
