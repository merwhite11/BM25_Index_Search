Can a tectonically inactive planet retain a long-term atmosphere?

Can a planet be tectonically inactive and still retain a magnetosphere and protected atmosphere? How does that work?
How else could a planet retain a thick atmosphere like Earth's for extensive periods of time? 
Note, I'm not asking on Earth science SE as, well, the question is not about Earth. I was hoping there was some sort of astronomical theory for other potential habitable planets.
