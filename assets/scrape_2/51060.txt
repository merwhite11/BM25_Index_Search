Natural line width from absorption lines

Emission lines have a certain natural width. Due to the uncertainty principle systems that spontaneously decay or produce radiation have a fundamental energy blur, and their radiation has a corresponding natural line width.
I am wondering how that phenomenon translates to absorption lines?
