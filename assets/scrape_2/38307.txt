50mm f1.8 for Astrophotography

I am considering using a 50mm f1.8 maybe even try aN 85mm f1.8 on my Astro FI 102MM Telescope have you any thoughts or suggestions?
I have never taken images via a telescope so this is a whole new learning curve. Need to get my brain back in gear, stopped shooting over 5yrs ago due to the gear being too heavy and my back injury not coping so this will be a much easier way of holding the camera...I HOPE.
