When is Betelgeuse (the shoulder star in the constellation of Orion) going to supernova?

My question is: when is Betelgeuse supposed to supernova? I have been waiting for a while now. Some people say it will explode this year, but I'm not sure. It is getting very close to its supernova, and I want to be able to witness the explosion.
