How to see Comet 46P/Wirtanen?

I've got a Celestron Astromaster 114 telescope. I live in Los Angeles and would like to get a look at 46P/Wirtanen. Can anyone tell me when this comet is going to brightest and how best to locate it in the sky? It's my (perhaps incorrect) understanding that it is not especially bright. Any tips/hints/information would be much appreciated.
