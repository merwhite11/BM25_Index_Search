Finding Jupiter, Saturn

I have a Dobson Omegon with a 640mm focal length and a 102mm aperture.
My finderscope is broken but I can do without.
I have located the planets with the naked eye but I do  I do not see them through my eyepiece.
I can focus perfectly on the moon, using a 20mm eyepiece. (I have a 6mm eyepiece as well.)
How should I proceed?
