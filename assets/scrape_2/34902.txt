What is this web on the surface of the Sun?

I was going through my Social Media Feed and found the attached post too frequent. The caption reads this is the best image of our Sun. Just as an example, the Universe Today's This is the Highest Resolution Image Ever Taken of the Surface of the Sun
Why? What exactly are the black lines that appear to be like kind of a web, and will such patterns be observed if in case the star was not the Sun but some other star? Are they thought to be common?
