At what speed does something have to travel away from us for it to red shift enough that it becomes invisible to the human eye?

Are there stars, galaxies etc that we cannot see because they are traveling too fast and their spectrum is shifted below our visible range? From what I understand, red shift is caused by stars and such moving away from the viewer. At what speed does a star etc have to travel to be invisible to us?
What if you are in one galaxy on one side of the universe that is expanding looking at a galaxy on the other expanding edge side. They would be traveling faster than the speed of light away from each other. Would they be invisible to each other?
