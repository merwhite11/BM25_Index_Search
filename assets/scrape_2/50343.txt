Do all black holes, including stellar-mass ones, rotate at nearly the speed of light? Also, what exactly does that do to their shape?

From what I understand, astrophysicists have known for almost a decade that supermassive black holes seem to spin at incredible velocities; nearly the speed of light...  In fact, some of the outer particles being dragged around appear to be propelled to nearly seven times the speed of light c ....
Are intermediate-mass and stellar-mass black holes rotating like this?  Does anyone know yet?
Also, how much of an oblate spheroid is formed from this?  Are these super-Kerr black holes substantially wider than they are tall?  Can we tell from the images of M87's hole and our own (Sagittarius A*)?
