what will be the values of number of photons present on each spectral type of stars (O, B, A, F, G, K,M)how can it measure from the luminosity

how can measure number of photons flux density of different spectral type of stars like O, B, A, F, G, K, M by integrating  Planck function with lowest and highest value of energy  .What will be the calculated  values for number of photons for each spectral type of stars?
