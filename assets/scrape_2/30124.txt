How much helium has been created since the Big Bang?

When I try to find figures for the amount of helium today and just after the Big Bang, I get similar figures.  I was expecting that all of the stars since then would have created more helium.  Is the amount below our ability to estimate?  Is helium being consumed at a similar or greater rate to produce heavier elements?  
Alternatively, can we measure/ estimate a drop in the hydrogen?  I presume that little hydrogen is being created.  I am unaware of any common nuclear process which creates lone protons.  (Please correct me if appropriate.)
Clarification: The Wikipedia Big Bang article mentions helium being created after a few minutes in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis.  So, it is helium created after this point that I am asking about.  I am presuming that negligible helium was created between this point and the first stars much later.  (Again, please correct me if I am wrong.)
