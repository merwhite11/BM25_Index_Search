Do black hole singularities actually merge?

new questioner here so please be gentle.
Do the singularities of merging black holes actually merge together?  I mean there are 2 infinitely small objects (singularities) that are trying to find each other but for them to merge they have to join at the EXACT same point in space.  I know they can get close, but to expect them to align perfectly with zero tolerance seems impossible.
