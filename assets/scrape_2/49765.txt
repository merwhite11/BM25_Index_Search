Which world did Carl Sagan know of with a million moons?

I recently read Carl Sagan's The Cosmic Connection. In it, he begins the seventh chapter with a series of claims to depict the universe as "vast and awesome."
I'm particularly interested in the second claim that he makes, which he does not mention again.

I know of a world with a million moons.

Is anyone aware of which world he might be talking about?
