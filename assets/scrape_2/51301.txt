Transformation of hour angle to azimuth

Converting Hour angle to Azimuth, is there a simple way to know which result is correct (as the formulas and the arccosine give various results shifted by 180° etc.), or does one just have to figure it out visually with a drawing?
$sin(A) = - \frac{\sin(H) \cos(\delta)}{\cos(a)}$
$cos(A) = \frac{\sin(\delta) - \sin(\phi) \sin(a)}{ \cos(\phi) \cos(a) }$
If there is a rule, please indicate if the Azimuth is counted from the southern or northern cardinal point.
