Earth's magnetic field vs. refrigerator magnet

According to this article:

The Earth's field ranges between approximately 25,000 and 65,000 nT
  (0.25â€“0.65 G). By comparison, a strong refrigerator magnet has a field
  of about 10,000,000 nanoteslas (100 G)

The Earth's magnetic field is between 150 and 400 times weaker than a refrigerator magnet.
Question: Can any magnet (or even one much stronger) of the Earth divert the cosmic rays as Earth's? Do these magnets somehow "interfere" with Earth's? If not, Why? Maybe because the size (not the power)?
