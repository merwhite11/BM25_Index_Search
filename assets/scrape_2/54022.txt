What does the moon's phases look like from the Equator?

I recently found out that the moon's appearance changes based on one's latitude, and while googling for more information I found conflicting images about what the moon's phases look like from the equator.
Some images (Example 1, Example 2) show the light of the moon starts from the bottom and grows up to the top while waxing, and then the shadow falls back down to the bottom while waning. (It's as if the light of the moon is an eyeball and the shadow is an eye lid).
There are other images though (Example 1, Example 2 ), that show the light of the moon starting from the top and "falling" down to the bottom draping the whole moon in light while waxing, and then the shadow starts from the top, then "falls" back down to the bottom draping the moon in shadow while waning.
I am not an knowledgeable on anything relating to astronomy, so I'd like to know: which one is correct?
