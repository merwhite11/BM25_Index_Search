Are black holes solely responsible for hyper velocity stars?

I read that the stars orbiting around Sagittarius A* (a.k.a the supermassive black hole located at the heart of the Milky Way) move very fast (many times faster than our Sun moves across the galaxy), and it is believed they have enough speed to wander off. My question is, is any exception to this rule, where somehow some stars may break a stellar speed limit not due to a black hole in their vicinity?
