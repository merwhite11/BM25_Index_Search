Formula to calculate round-trip travel time based on current distance to far-away galaxy

The question was closed as HW-like there.
The Premise
You travel at a constant velocity towards a far-away galaxy. You then travel back at the same velocity. How long will have passed for the people on Earth? Answers must take into account the expansion of the universe.
Definitions:

now is defined as 21st century

Parameters:

Time from now you will depart (in years)
Distance away that the galaxy is now (in light-years)
Velocity (in % of light-speed)

Output:

number of years that will have passed on Earth between the time you depart and the time you get back

This was inspired by this question: At 50% c, I go party to IC1101 galaxy, and back home. How many times can i go before the expansion of the universe will lock me on one side?

Significance
This will allow for many different astronomical calculations by moving the elements of the formula around (eg. how long until we won't be able to communicate with a distant galaxy?).
