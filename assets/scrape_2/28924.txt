A point of light moving between the stars

I noticed you replied to a question before about this topic and i came across your answer. Way back in the 80s when i was in my teens i saw a point of light moving between the stars at a steady rate across the sky. It was about the same size and brightnesz of those visible. It was moving in such a was as it approached a star ir veered off left or right then continued on its original path across the night sky. I showed my sister who was older than me at the time. It kind of reminded me of a whiplash efect using gravity to maintain sp√®ed. Mabie too much Star Trek, but you get the idea. I am not an astronomer so forgive my ignorance, but a plane or a satalite would not move in this manor would it? I am convinced to this day that it was not one of ours. Can you clarify this as it was definately avoiding the stars?
