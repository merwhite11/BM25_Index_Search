Three Body Problem

I tried to solve the three body problem numerically.
While after 1000 time steps the system looks stable (See Fig.1)
it is completely unstable after 10000 time steps (See Fig.2).
Is that an intrinsic property of the three body problem or a mistake in my code or initial conditions?
