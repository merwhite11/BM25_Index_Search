What eyepiece or other optics might improve image quality or observing experience for my Shilba Eclipse 60900 telescope?

I have an old Shilba Eclipse 60900 telescope.
Specs:

Object diameter: 60mm
Focal Distance: 900mm.

Optics:

Barlow 3x
1.5x Erecting Eyepiece
4mm and 12.5mm eyepieces.

I'm aware it's a basic one, with a limiting magnification of about 120x. However, it's more than enough for the use I'm willing to give it.
Are there any eyepieces or other auxiliary optics that might provide either better quality images or a better observing experience?
Edit: Thank you all for the kind answers and corrections. By lens I meant the eyepiece. I've just taken it off the telescope and it measures at about 3cm in diameter. It is an old telescope so it's likely the only surviving eyepiece.
I'm linking a few pictures:
