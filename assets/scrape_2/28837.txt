Can we see the color of nebulae?

Someone asked me this question:

To see the color of the Great Nebula in Orion, how large the aperture of the telescope should be.

I donâ€™t even know whether this is possible. I understand that the colorful patterns of the nebulae are from the cameras. Besides, my own experience shows that when I target the telescope at them, I see nothing but some white blur.
So is this possible when we watch the deep sky objects with a really huge telescope, under the finest conditions?
