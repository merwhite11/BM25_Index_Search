Did the International Sun-Earth Explorer detect cosmic rays other than gamma rays?

In looking at the available datasets described by NASA for the International Sun-Earth Explorer, I am only see gamma ray burst data.
Was the platform capable of recording cosmic rays other than gamma rays? If so, where is the data?
