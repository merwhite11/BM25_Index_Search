Can I slice off a piece of the Sun?

Bear with me. I want to explain this to my 6 and half year old.
If, all things being equal, we could reach out to the Sun with a suitable implement, a gigantic space knife, could we cut a piece off the Sun? Take a slice from it? Do we end up with a body of Hydrogen and Helium, or is it impossible to extract anything from it?
I know that the Sun is a massive ball of plasma, the sheer mass compressing the gas through gravity until fusion is achieved. What I have been asked is, effectively, what happens if you try to take a piece of that plasma? Of our sun?
