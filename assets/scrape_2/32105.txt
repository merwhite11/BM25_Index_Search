Invisible Mass Affecting the Expansion of the Universe

Are there enough neutrinos & other invisible particles in a cubic light year of space to significantly affect the expansion of the universe,& at a very rough estimate without taking into account WIMPS & other exotic particles for which there is no firm evidence,what would be the total mass of this quantity of matter? Only a tiny proportion of all the neutrinos emitted since the Big Bang have been absorbed,the rest are still flying around in search of a home.
