Spectrum of stars

If some specific metal is shown in a star's spectrum, does it indicate that the star has that specific metal? For example, the Sun, a G2 star, shows medium strength of Ionised Calcium in its spectrum, but why does the chemical composition of the Sun doesn't really have Ionised Calcium? https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Chemical+Composition
Edit: why does the chemical composition of the Sun only have a trace amout of Ionised Calcium, but the strength in the spectrum is not low at all?
Thank you in advance!
