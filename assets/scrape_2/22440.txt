is this really true that speed of light is same as we look from different parts of universe?

According to the theory of relativity. The speed of light is same for every observer. But how can we know that this applies to more than a local region? What if light travelled to us from a distant region where the speed of light was different or where the relativistic principle did not apply?
Can we design an experiment that refutes both these ideas?
