Do stars of a galaxy change their positions relatively to each other?

Complete astronomy noob over here who would be happy if he get a simple answer (and who is also aware that this may be not possible)...
I've learned from a tv documentary that the stars at the edge of the galaxy are not traveling more slowely than the ones closer to the center. 
Does this also mean that all stars in a galaxy do not change their positions relatively to each other? 
To put it simply: If I note the relative position of a star compared to our sun, and then do it again 10 (100 / 1000) years later: Are the coordinates of that star identical or will the star be in a different relative position?
I would assume that the star is in a completely different (relative) place given the speed star systems are travelling because the galaxy is rotating AND the "fact" (read: I don't know if this is really a fact) that the solar system is oscillating through the galactic plane.
