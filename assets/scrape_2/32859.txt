If the Moon were impacted by a suitably sized meteor, how long would it take to impact the Earth?

An answer to the question of How well would the Moon protect the Earth from a Meteor? mentions as a possibility that the Moon could get knocked into the Earth.
What is the smallest change to the orbit of the Moon from being impacted by a large meteor that would cause it to eventually impact the Earth (i.e. "circling the drain")? What timeline would that look like (minutes, hours, days, years, etc)?
