Oort cloud shape

In the episode of Cosmos dedicated to cometary objects and other things, the Oort cloud was graphically rendered as a spherical distribution of dots.
This surprised me as I thought that it should be somehow a disk or a torus, given the solar system's rotational momentum. 
Why is the Oort ensemble thought to be spherical? Is it deduced from the orbits of the various comets? I think so.
Why it does not spread into a more disk like object?
