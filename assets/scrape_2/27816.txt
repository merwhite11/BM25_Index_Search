What are the craters on the moon with peaks in the middle of them?

Was taking some extremely amatuer pictures of the moon from my cheap telescope with my camera phone...

You see the crater Im talking about? Top right.The one with a little nub in the middle- which Im sure is actually massive. How was this formed differently than the other craters? What couldve caused the hill?
