What was the orbital path of earth before collision with a Mars sized planet?

There are hypotheses about a collision between Earth and an astronomical body the size of Mars, approximately 4.5 billion years ago, about 20 to 100 million years after the solar system coalesced.
I guess this changed the orbital path of earth around the Sun. Do we have any info what was the Earth's orbital path before the collision? (I would prefer some visual explanation.)
