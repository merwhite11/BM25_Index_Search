stellar evolution fortran code-runge kutta mass step from center to fitting point

I am trying to integrate the four stellar model equations from the core to a fitting point and from the surface to the fitting point ($x_f$). When I start the outward integration, however, I have to use a huge mass shell step $dx$ where $x_1=dx$ too and the callling routine has the form $rk4(dx,x,y,dy)$(Runge-Kutta 4th order with mass step $dx,x$ core). As a result I am getting a bus error. I do not know what is the appropriate step since if we consider that I want to integrate from $x_1$ to $x_f=10^{33}$, it means that I need a huge step $dx$ to make it work. I have tried it in many different ways and I cannot figure out how to properly do that and get a result when dealing with such huge numbers. If you have any ideas I would appreciate it, since I am stuck! Thank you very much!
