How did the mountain range form in Galle crater?

In the Galle crater, there is a mountain range that is shaped like a circle segment that makes it look like a smiley face. How did this mountain range form? Is it a central ring that formed with the crater that then got partially eroded away? Or did it form after the crater? Or something else?
