Why telescope mirror glass shipped as randomly broken chunks of a constant size in cardboard boxes?

The video MIRROR LAB: Preparing for Casting GMT's Mirror 6 shows the unpacking several hundred boxes full of broken glass from OHARA, packed in styrofoam.
The glass chunks are a fairly uniform size of perhaps 15 cm, and of compact shape; there are no long slivers or sheets; they are all very roughly cuboids.
This seems to be deliberate. It could have been ground to a finer, pourable size, or even smaller for filling the nooks and crannies of the support web at the bottom of the mold, or in much larger sheets or bars. But these roughly block shaped pieces are stacked like bricks by hand, one at a time, into the mold.
Why is this so?
