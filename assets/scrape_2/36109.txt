Position of the Sun in the constellation Pisces around the year 1500

I am reading a book on ancient astronomy and it claims that around the year 1500 the position of the sun, at the time of the spring equinox, was on the tail end of the second fish in the constellation of Pisces. Now I understand this might be more guess work than anything else but I am wondering if this claim could be even remotely true. I don't even know where to begin in calculating this. Any help is appreciated.
