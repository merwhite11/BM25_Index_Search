What are the effects of mass concentration along a planet's axis of rotation?

Reading about geological history of Mars and coming across the Martian dichotomy, which is about having the two hemispheres' geography differ in elevation by 1 to 3 km.
Does this mean that Mars' center of mass is slightly shifted to the south? and if so, more generally, what is the influence of a concentration of mass aligned with the rotational axis of a planet that is not tidally locked?
