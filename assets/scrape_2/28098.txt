How could original astronomers have used the clouds to find distances?

I was looking at a very bright moon tonight through light cloud cover and saw a halo of light far bigger than the moon imposed on the clouds. Almost in a conic shape by comparison. I was wondering if early astronomers could use this difference to calculate the distance of the moon given the height of the cloud and the dimensions of earth.
