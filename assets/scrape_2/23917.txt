Can you translate a GPS coordinate to a Galactic coordinate?

I am a complete newbie to astronomy and all the related.
So if i say something stupid i am sorry. 
But i was wondering if it is possible to translate GPS coordinates like the following: 
lat: 41.420042122273024 
long: 2.1533203149999736 

to its corresponding Galactic coordinates?
I am grateful for all insights that you may offer me :)
PS: if this is the wrong exchange to ask this could you refer me to the right place to ask this question.
