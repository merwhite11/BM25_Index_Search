Is there anything different about the gravitation around a non-spinning black hole and a neutron star of the same mass?

If we perform a simple experiment by orbiting identical spacecraft around a non-rotating black hole and a non-rotating neutron star of equal mass at a "safe" distance, and ignore differences other than gravitation (e.g. magnetic fields and charge) would there be any differences in their orbits predicted by general relativity?
"Safe" distance means far from the event horizon of the black hole and where tidal forces don't disrupt the spacecraft.
After writing this answer I am now wondering if it's 100% correct.
