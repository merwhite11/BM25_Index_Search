Could there really be a preferential direction to the speed of light?

This question is inspired by a recent video by Veritasium Why no one has measured the speed of light linked below.
To summarize the video, Derek points out that it is impossible to measure the one-way speed of light, and shows examples of what the consequences of a preferential direction for the speed of light might be.
While the examples given of the measurement problem and consequences all appear valid on local scales, they seem to me to fall apart when you look at the scale of the observable universe. Wouldn't we be able to observe the effects of a preferential direction to the speed of light at cosmological scales? Take the extreme case: the speed of light in one direction is 1/2c and infinite in the opposite direction. If this was true, we should be able to observe the entire universe in the direction where light is approaching us at infinite speed, and see no redshift due to the expansion of the universe (because the photons would reach us instantaneously, there would be no time for the expansion of the universe to stretch them out). Even in less extreme cases, we should still see "more" universe and less redshift in one direction than its opposite.
Since we don't (to my knowledge) observe any difference in the "quantity" of universe (for lack of a better term, feel free to edit if there is a better term for this) in any direction, or any difference in the amount of redshift in any direction, then if there exists a preferential direction to the speed of light, it must be small enough that its effects lie within the error bars for our ability to measure the universe on cosmic scales.
Is my reasoning correct here, or is there some effect I did not take into account that would adjust things so we wouldn't see any difference? (or perhaps my understanding of cosmology is entirely flawed?)
