Meteors made of differing substances. Will they all burn up?

If an object enters Earth's atmosphere, what determines whether it burns up or not?
Example
A feather is released from a space-ship 30,000 km away from Earth and falls under the influence of Earth's gravity.
Will it burn up on re-entry or will it float down to the surface unharmed. If it would be unharmed, where is the cutoff point for which objects survive?
