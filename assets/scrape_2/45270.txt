What actually is the mass?

Since high school, I've been told that the definition of mass is "quantity of matter" (which is absolutely wrong, I guess). If mass is actually a quantity of matter and it is a measure of inertia, when a giant-star dies, if it is massive enough to undergo a supernova, it could either transforms into a neutron star or a black hole. Now, in a supernova some amount of matter is lost, but how does the black hole manage to have such a greater mass than its parent star? Coming to the "definition", where has the excess matter come from? I know it hasn't, in practice it is not the case and it is not possible. So what is the actual definition of mass? What quantity does the mass define? And what are the factors creating/affecting inertia?
