Does a 4-manifold universe imply zero net energy?

If our universe is a 4-manifold (i.e. with every point in space-time already existing) does this imply that there is zero net energy (as net energy would do work and so change the universe)?
If so, how do we account for the fact that our current experience of the universe is very far from net zero energy? Are there stores of negative energy out there? (Or, more likely, have I misunderstood this question?!)
