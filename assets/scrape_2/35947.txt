Light profile fitting related questions

I am computer scientist and now I'm working with some astrophysical projects. During this work I accumulated some questions and maybe here I would be able to find some answers or advice where to look for them. I already read some of the wiki pages on topic, but it didn't help. 
We are working with fitting light profiles of some eliptic galaxies with GALPHAT using Sersic and Sersic Exponential models.
1. So first question would be, what exactly means to fit a light profile? I get a bunch of parameters as output (X, Y, Mag, re, n, q and others), but what exactly does it mean? 
2. And the second question is what is the difference between these two models?
