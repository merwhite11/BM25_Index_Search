Recognising lunar month only by looking at the sky

Suppose somebody went on an island and don't have sense about time, dates, months. The only thing he has is seeing the sky. Is it possible to recognise which lunar month it is by just looking the sky?
I ask this because I know how to see beginning of the lunar month, but how to recognise which month is it? So we can look at the Sun, Moon, the stars. Is there a way to figure that out?
