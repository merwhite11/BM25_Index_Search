Can a star eat a black hole?

I know there are stars much larger than the sun and that we've discovered "small" black holes, so, let's say that the Pistol Star, which is at least 80x the mass of the sun, and the smallest known black hole, XTE J1650-500, around 4x the mass of the sun, collide. Would the pistol star "eat" the black hole, or is there some property that a black hole has that is immune to the star's power? 
I would think that the star would turn the black hole inside out, and like explode or something, but there's also the possibility that once a black hole rips space time the way it does maybe that can't be easily undone. I'm assuming the matter within the black hole isn't going to magically pop back into existence either as it's been broken down into it's most basic parts.
