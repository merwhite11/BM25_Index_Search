Can smaller habitable planets (or moons) orbit a larger habitable planet?

I am doing some research for my fantasy novel, but I'd like to really understand how my planet system would cause life to grow if at all possible. 
My idea would be, there is a large core planet that is orbiting a sun. Two smaller planets (or moons) are in an orbit around it on polar opposite sides of the core planet. Is this even possible? Would the necessary means to spark life occur?
