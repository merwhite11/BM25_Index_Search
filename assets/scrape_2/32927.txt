Geo Helio and RA

please assist me , i'm using Zet 9 and there is Geo longitude , Helio longitude and RA , what is the difference between them.
example :
                     Mars
Date        Time     HLng       Lng        RA
01.01.2000  0:00:00  359.12584  327.57547  330.14521

some books use geo long. and the RA interchangeably as if they are the same thing , but they are not.
please help , thanks in advance.
