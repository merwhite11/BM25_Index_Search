Back when the CMB was predominantly in the visible spectrum, would it have been visible to the naked eye?

The CMB is a near-perfect black-body spectrum, and assuming this has been true since the de-coupling, we should have been able to see the glow. In fact, at a certain point, it should have been almost exactly like staring into the sun in all directions. Is this correct?
