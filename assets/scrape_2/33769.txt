What alternative facilities would be available in the event of JWST being destroyed?

Unfortunately, space launches can and do go wrong. Suppose that after all the delays and budget overruns, the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope fails and the telescope becomes a cloud of very expensive shrapnel raining into the sea.
Are there any upcoming/planned facilities that would be able to do similar science to what JWST would be capable of within the next decade, or are all our eggs in one basket on this one?
