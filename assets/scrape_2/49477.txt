When's the most recent time that we could have missed a supernova?

I know that if a supernova were to happen in the galactic Core, the dust there would prevent the visible light from it from reaching us, so if one were to have occurred there in say 1900, we wouldn't have initially noitced it.
But nowadays we'd detect it via other wavelengths of light as well as by its neutrinos (like we did with SN 1987A).
When's the most recent time that we could fail to notice a supernova for at least a few years after it happened?
