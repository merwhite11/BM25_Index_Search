Could an ultra-hot Jupiter flare?

Some of the ultra-hot Jupiters (WASP-33b, KELT-9b) have dayside surface temperatures similar to low-mass stars. Would they be capable of producing flares? To be specific, I am asking about the possibility of flaring on the planet itself, rather than the planet inducing flares on the star.
