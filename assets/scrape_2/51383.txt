Are red giants still primarily made of hydrogen? What is their exact composition?

How much lower is the ratio of hydrogen to helium in a red giant vs a 'normal' main sequence star like our Sun?
Also, how low does the ratio get at the end of a red giant's life?  (Just before it becomes a white dwarf, or goes onto the asymptotic giant branch, or whatever...)
