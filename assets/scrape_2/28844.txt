Deducing distance of closest neighbor galaxy from expression of correlation and mean galaxy density

The original post was on physics exchange but I prefer to move it here :
I am trying to estimate the distance of closest galaxy neighbor knowing the expression of number of neighbors $\text{d}N$ into a volume $\text{d}V$, the mean density $n_\text{gal}$ and the correlation function, i.e with this expression:
$$\text{d}N=n_{\text{gal}}\,\text{d}V\,(1+\xi(r))$$
with $\xi(r)=\bigg(\dfrac{r}{r_{0}}\bigg)^{-\gamma}\quad\text{with}\quad\gamma\,\sim\,1.77 \quad\text{and}\,r_{0}\,\sim\,5\,\text{Mpc}$. 
I must precise that expression of $\xi(r)$ is valid for $r$ between $0.5\,\text{and}\,10\,\text{Mpc}$
I take into my calculation the following value for $n_{\text{gal}}=0.0420\,\text{h}^{-3}\,\text{Mpc}^{-3}$ : I tried to choose a typical value for this density but it depends on which scale we consider (galaxy cluster, super cluster, very large scales ...), so maybe don't focus on this value.
What it interests me is to have elements to answer to the following question :
How could I infer the distance of the closest galaxy from us?
UPDATE 1: Maybe I should take the lower limit of validity for the definition of $\xi(r)$, i.e $r=0.5\,\text{Mpc}$ and so:
$$\text{d}N/\text{d}V=n_{\text{gal}}\,(1+\xi(r=0.5))$$
So I would have:
$$\text{D}_{\text{closest}}=\bigg(n_{\text{gal}}(1+(0.5/5)^{-1.77})\bigg)^{-1/3}=0.7353\,\text{Mpc}$$
But by taking $r=0.5\,\text{Mpc}$, I am already located myself like the closest neighbor was at $r=0.5\,\text{Mpc}$, am I not ?
Is this reasoning correct?
Any help is welcome
