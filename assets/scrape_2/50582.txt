How would ocean tides work on a tidally-locked planet?

Since the tidal bulge is always in the same place, how would that affect ocean tides? Would they change throughout an elliptical orbit, due to changing distance from the star? How exactly would they behave? And would tides on a tidally locked moon behave the same way?
