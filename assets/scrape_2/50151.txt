What would be 1 hour equivalent on these moons of Jupiter and Saturn compared to earth? And their astrobiological implications

Considering the distance from and velocity of Sun, Saturn, Jupiter, thermal energy due to motion other than that adding/combining to velocity, and the individual mass and velocity of the particular moons and our earth,
1 hour on earth equals how many hours on the following particular moons of Saturn and Jupiter,

Europa
Io
Titan
Enceladus
Callisto
Ganymede
Rhea
Iapetus
Dione
Tethys

Or in a more easy way, a link to a webpage where this is already calculated
Also most importantly, what will be the implications of this on evolution of possible life as compared to our time perspective?
