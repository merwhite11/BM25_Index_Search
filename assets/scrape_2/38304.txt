How can something infinitely big have expanded from an infinitely small?

Please help me reconcile what I see as contradicting theories:

The universe began with the Big Bang and expanded from an infinitesimally small point.
The universe is infinite.

How can something infinitely big "expand" from an infinitely small point? There has to be some sort of a 'blast wave', right?
Also, if we think we know the total amount of matter the Big Bang must have produced - how can a limited amount of matter fill an infinitely big universe?
P.S. One idea I have is that the universe may be infinite, but the Big Bang didn't create it - it created matter within the infinitely big universe. This would explain the expansion we're observing now: the matter will continue being distributed across the infinitely large universe. So I guess my question is more of a "why this assumption is incorrect"... :)
