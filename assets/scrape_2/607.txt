How do/did we figure out that planets move in orbits?

I've learned that planets move in orbits around the Sun, but I really don't know how I would come to this conclusion myself. I've only seen planets in the sky a couple times (knowingly), and I am curious how we know for certain today that planets really move in orbits around the Sun (i.e., rather than moving but not around the Sun or moving around the Sun in a shape that is not a regular path).
I've also heard that people in the past knew about orbits even when they thought that Earth was at the center of the solar system. How did they figure this out in their times with their technology?
