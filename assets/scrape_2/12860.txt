trying to understand stellar nucleosynthesis

Trying to create a periodic table that shows "where" elements are made. For example big bang, cosmic rays, stars, supernovae etc...but reading a lot about gold,and other heavy neutron rich elements, being formed in colliding neutron stars. Is there a definitive list of elements that may have been formed in neutron stars?
