The question regarding ZTF20acigmel space event detection

I have a question re Ð°rXiv preprint article:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05490.pdf
It describes the detection of a space event, dubbed ZTF20acigmel, which was a massive explosion in a galaxy located several billion light-years from Earth.
It was recorded in October 2020, then it reached its maximum brightness, but disappeared within a month.
Should such event generate gravitational wave and if "yes", why it wasn't registered by LIGO/Virgo?
