When did the first annular eclipse happen?

A few hundreds of millions of years ago, the moon was closer to the Earth than it is today and hence was of a bigger apparent size. This made every solar eclipse either total or partial. Over the course of time, due to tidal forces between the moon and the Earth, the moon slowly drifted far from Earth decreasing its apparent size when viewed from Earth and hence causing annular eclipses to happen.
That would mean there must have been some day in history when Earth witnessed its first ever annular eclipse. Is there an estimate on when this happened?
