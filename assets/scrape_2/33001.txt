Could Tabby's star be beamed by a neutron star's jet causing irregular star spots?

There have been some other questions here about what might cause the light curve dips of star KIC 8462852 as observed by Kepler Space Telescope. Here's one I haven't heard before:
Could it be that a neutron star, from Earth yet unobserved, or another supernova remnant in the relative vicinity of Tabby's star, hits it with its polar jet stream? Being in the focus of an irregular jet of charged particles would disturb the star's magnetic field, somehow causing star spot patterns, and upsetting its photosphere perhaps otherwise too.
Can this be excluded?
