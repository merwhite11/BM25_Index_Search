What would the effects be on Earth if Jupiter was turned into a star?

In Clarke's book 2010, the monolith and its brethren turned Jupiter into the small star nicknamed Lucifer.  Ignoring the reality that we won't have any magical monoliths appearing in our future, what would the effects be on Earth if Jupiter was turned into a star?
At it's closest and furthest:  
How bright would the "back-side" of the earth be with light from Lucifer?  
How much heat would the small star generate on earth?  
How many days or months would we actually have night when we circled away behind the sun?
How much brighter would the sun-side of earth be when Lucifer and the sun both shine on the same side of the planet?
