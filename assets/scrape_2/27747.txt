How does the Moon move in the "night" sky as seen from the poles?

A photo in the NYTimes article Ice Surveys and Neckties at Dinner: Hereâ€™s Life at an Arctic Outpost has got me thinking.
During the winter months at either the north or south pole, when it is constantly dark, how does the Moon behave? 
Would a nearly-full moon sometimes circle for days without setting, or would it still rise and set, or would it be all together missing, or some combination of all of the above?
