Have we observed any rogue/wandering stars?

Do we know (have we observed and cataloged) any rogue star, being not part of galaxy, but drifting somewhere in inter-galactic space?
I know that determining if a star is a part of galaxy or not is a matter of definition, but let's take those, that inter-galactic space is where the gravitational influence of any galaxy isn't dominating.
