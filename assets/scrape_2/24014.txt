How did Ptolemy prove in the following excerpt that the Earth is not cylindrical?

I have trouble interpreting the following excerpt: 

“Nor could it [the Earth] be cylindrical, with the curved surface in the east-west direction, and the flat sides towards the poles of the universe, which some might suppose more plausible. This is clear from the following: for those living on the curved surface none of the stars would be ever-visible, but either all stars would rise and set for all observers, or the same stars, for an equal [celestial] distance from each of the poles, would always be invisible for all observers.” 

I understand that if the Sun rotated around the curved side of the cylinder, no one living on the curved side would see any ever-visible stars because their view of the celestial views is blocked. However Ptolemy states that “all stars would rise and set for all observers,” which I believe would be wrong because the two poles and the curved surface would be oriented in different directions on a cylinder. He also states that the other possibility is that “the same stars, for an equal [celestial] distance from each of the poles, would always be invisible for all observers.” However, I don’t understand how his explanation in the excerpt directly above would prove that “the same stars… would always be invisible for all observers.”
