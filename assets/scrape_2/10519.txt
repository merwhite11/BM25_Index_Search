Could there be a closer star to Earth than the Alpha Centauri triple star system, excluding the Sun?

Do we know for certain that the nearest star to Earth, excluding the Sun and the theorized Nemesis, is the Alpha Centauri multiple star system, at +/-4.4 light-years away? Have we been able to identify every star that is <5 light-years from Earth or is there a possibilty a faint star could be nearer?  Are there stars that we haven't looked at yet that could be closer?
