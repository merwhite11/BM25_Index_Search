If a rocky world is large enough (not a gas or ice giant) can it have helium from the primordial disk in its atmosphere?

When planets are formed do only gas and ice giants accrete hydrogen and helium? Does this accretion have to be beyond the "snow line"?
In other words, would all hydrogen or helium in the atmosphere of a super-earth come from outgassing (radioactive decay, etc)?
