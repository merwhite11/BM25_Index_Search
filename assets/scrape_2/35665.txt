How is Uranus' north pole defined?

The rotation axis of the planet Uranus is tilted by 98° compared to its plane of orbit. This means that the north pole of Uranus is "under" the ecliptic compared to the north pole of other planets. 
Why was the value of 98° chosen, rather than 82° ? How was it decided which pole should be north?
