Why does Wikipedia state that the Solar System has one unconfirmed planet?

I was looking at exoplanets on Wikipedia, and found this surprising information:

The table states that the Sun has 8 planets (obviously) and one unconfirmed planet. Why is this here? I think it's Planet Nine, but I also have underlying thoughts that this planet is Pluto, a disputed dwarf/real planet. Is this correct?
