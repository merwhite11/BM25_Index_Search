...but where did Mars' atmosphere actually GO?

In this answer to How is space a vacuum when there are planets, gases, etc? I mention that most of Mars' original atmosphere was swept away by the solar wind after the planet lost its magnetic field and ability to hold the swift charged particles at bay1.
But where did Mars' original atmosphere end up? How far did it get?

1though comments there suggests that's not necessarily a correct and/or complete explanation.
