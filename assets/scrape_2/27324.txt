We are in Green Lake, WI, 8/12/18, seeing bright orange “planet”/“star” almost due South, perhaps 20 degrees above horizon, what is it?

I have a “sky” app on my ipad and expected it to be Mars, but my app shows Mars just below horizon and closer to East. Oh, I should add that we saw this about 10:15 tonight. Hanging out watching meteor shower, orange object didn’t move much, if at all. I’ve never seen something so orange (or perhaps it is more red).
