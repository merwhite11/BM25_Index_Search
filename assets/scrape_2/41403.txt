If a Jupiter-sized sphere of a translucent liquid were to suddenly appear, what would the inner core consist of? Would the planet refract light?

Assuming Jupiter is suddenly replaced, or if a giant sphere of fruit juice or other translucent mixtures/liquids were to appear bearing a similar radius to that of Jupiter, hypothetically , what would be the contents of the inner core? Would the pressure there be so high as to rip the liquids into their constituent atoms? Would light from a Sun shining on this planet be refracted through the planet's translucent body?
