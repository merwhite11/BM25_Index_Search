Why isn't a month 28 days?

1 days is a rotation of earth. 1 years is an orbit of the sun. I've always beleived that one month is 1 period of the moon orbiting earth but the inconsistent distribution of days throughout the months has raised some questions. Why are months 30 or 31 days with one having 28? The orbital period of the moon is between 27 and 28 days. I know that's not a whole number but wouldn't it makes more sense to have 13 months of 28 days? Astronomically, that would be more accurately representative of the moons orbit. Why 30 and 31 days, and why 12 months?
