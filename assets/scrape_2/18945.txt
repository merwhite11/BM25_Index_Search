Is Barnard 68 the only cloud so close to us that there are no stars between us and it?

Regarding molecular clouds / absorption nebulae / Bok globules / obscuring clouds,
(I'm not sure if there's one generic term encompassing all those and any similar obscuring clouds - I just used "cloud" in the question title),
is Barnard 68 the only one so close to us that there are no stars between us and it?
If not, what is the list of such?  (Are we observationally confident about this, at this stage?)

I guess a related question would be: "about what is the density of bok globules near us?" ... in a cube of 1000pc on a side, about how many bok globules are we talking? One or two or thousands??
