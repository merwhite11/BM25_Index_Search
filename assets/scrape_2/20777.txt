Strange square-like formation on Mars

Recently I've explored an area on Mars' surface which one looks like huge hatch cap & hole, about 10 kilometers, between tons of circular craters.
The formation is very unique and strange to me. Somehow it has moved from original location and broke into two pieces then half part disappeared.
What do you think about it?
