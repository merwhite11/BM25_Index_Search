Is it coincidence that the change in GPE when falling from deep space into the largest know neutron star is approximately mc squared Joules?

We can calculate the change in GPE in falling from a very long distance to the surface of a star or planet from
$$\Delta{GPE} = \int_{r}^{\infty}mg\,dh $$
But taking into account that g will change with h according to the inverse square law as
$$g=g_{0}r^2/(h+r)^2$$ Where $g_{0}$ is the surface gravity
$$\Delta{GPE}=mg_{0}r^2\int_{r}^{\infty}1/(h+r)^2\,dh$$
After integrating this by substitution with the limits you should get
$$\Delta{GPE}=mg_{0}r^2/(r+1)$$
So provided r is significantly greater than 1, a good approximation will be
$$\Delta{GPE}\approx{mgr}$$
That means for a mass falling to the surface of Earth from space we will get a potential energy reduction of $9.81\times{6371000}$ which is approximately $62.5 MJ/Kg$ (which agrees pretty well with what I have read elsewhere)
But for the largest known neutron star, the surface gravity is about $7*10^{12}m/s^2$ which means that if its radius was $12.9km$ (a rough approximation of what it is thought to be) $gr$ would equal $c^2$ and GPE of a mass falling into it would reduce by $mc^2$ Joules on the way down.
Is that just coincidence, or does mass lose (nearly) all of its energy while falling into the largest known neutron star?
