Calculate the diameter of a galaxy

With reference to this
Diameter of any galaxy question.
I need some help to calculate an estimate for NGC 1792. I need to calculate a few galaxy diameters so looking for help on one to then work out the rest on the others. I know the megaparsec is  15.33 to 2 dp.  https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso0338b/
What I don't know is the the radians.  I get Angular size from Simbad as
6.17 3.02 136 (Opt) D 

but which is if any is the radian or how to calculate the radian.  In the answer, Dieudonn√© says "you can get the actual diameter D from: D = d tan A".  What is D measured in?  Parsec etc?
