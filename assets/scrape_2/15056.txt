What does the filter name I+z' mean

On the TRAPPIST telescope, the filter wheels are described to have a filter with the following description:

NIR Luminance I+z' (>700nm)

After a bit of googling, I wasn't able to find what the specifics of this filter are (its FWHM and mean wavelength).
How would I go about finding these qualities of this filter?
