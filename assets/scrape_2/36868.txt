Why is the position of the Sun so fixed?

Please correct me if I tell something wrong.
As we already know, a planet (e.g. Earth) remains on its orbit due to the gravity of the Sun.
If the Sun's gravity were not there, the Earth would be thrown into the space. Now we know, why the Earth stays there.
My question is, what is holding the Sun at its place? Why is the Sun so fixed?
Is there any force that keeps the Sun so fixed?
