How to use Astropy to edit a keyword (not value) in batches of FITS file headers to be used in AstroimageJ (AIJ)? (summer undergrad research project)

I would be so grateful if someone could help me. I am stuck for over a week now trying to find some way to use Astropy to write some small code to edit one keyword in batches of FITS file headers so that they can be used in AstroimageJ(AIJ) for a summer undergrad research project. Thank you so much for any help. AstroimageJ wants DATE-OBS (for example) but my files say DATE-BEG, which is not an accepted KEYWORD for the start of exposure date/time.   Thank you so much for any help. It's very appreciated. I've been stuck for a week now. Above is a screenshot of the AIJ documentation. Followed by a screenshot of one my .FITS file headers that I accessed just by renaming it as a .TXT file, and then I can edit it by hand. But I have thousands of files to edit. Thank you!
