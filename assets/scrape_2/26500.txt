Why does the Sun's surface contain lithium?

As far as I was aware, stars don't usually have lithium, but it has been observed that there is plenty of lithium on our star's surface. 
In addition, a team lead by Garik Israelian took a census of 500 stars, 70 of which are known to host planets and about a quarter of which are particularly Sun-like. Using ESO’s HARPS spectrograph, this team of astronomers (see here) found that the Sun-like stars which host planets have destroyed their lithium much more efficiently than “planet-free” stars. 
Why do Sun-like stars have lithium on their surfaces and why do stars that host planets destroy their lithium more efficiently?
