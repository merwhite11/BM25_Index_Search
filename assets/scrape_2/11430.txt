Could evaporating hot Jupiters have metallic hydrogen on their surfaces?

Jupiter is believed to have metallic hydrogen in its core. And gas giants that migrate to become hot Jupiters are believed to evaporate, have their atmospheres blown away by their nearby star. Can metallic hydrogen (or some other exotic materia) be detected on the surface of such a planet, or does it require high pressure to exist? What happens to the metallic hydrogen? Does it release much energy if and when it is transformed?
