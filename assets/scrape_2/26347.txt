Given sunrise, noon, sunset, longitude and latitude can I calculate the "hight" or "ascension" of the sun?

I'm trying to make a simple app for my own use to be able to check which of my favorit restaurants have outdoor seating sun and for how long etc.
Given the data in the title (sunrise, noon, sunset, longitude and latitude) I can draw a path where the sun should be at any given time, but I want to display the hight as well.
I live in sweden where the sun changes "hight angle" (sorry I don't know the exact term for it) which make the angle relevant when deciding on seatings amongst high buildings.
My end goal is to be able to use google maps 3D data to actually cast shadows on the map in a realistic way!
I have no Idea if I'm in the right place but I figure I'll give it a shot :)
