Finding ones way around the sky

Thinking about this recent question Identify T-shaped constellation the first thing I have to say is that I applaud the poster for actually looking up and noticing the stars: something that becomes harder every year, particularly from a city like London.
I remember coming across mention of a classic book called something like "The Sky by Clock and Hand", which went a bit further than the usual "star finder" disc by guiding the reader between constellations by stepping around the sky using a handspan as the unit of angle.
Does anybody recognise the book? Is it still in print, and if not is there a PDF anywhere that could be recommended as a useful learning resource?
Googling for the two words "handspan" and "angle" turn up some useful resources, albeit not a step-by-step guide.
