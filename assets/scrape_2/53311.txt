What exactly IS a "Domain Wall"?

A Domain Wall is an "topological defect" and a 2-dimensional singularity. They are widely theorized to exist throughout the universe, but none have been detected yet. I'm having trouble understanding what they actually are though, the wikipedia articles and papers I looked at just have a lot of advanced mathematics.

Can light pass through a Wall? Do they emit/reflect any light.
Can matter pass through a Wall? If I were in a spacecraft, and I passed through a Wall, what would I see?
If it is a 2-d singularity, does it have an event horizon?
Does it have charge and spin like a black hole?
