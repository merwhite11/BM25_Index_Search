When is the best time to observe M81 from the Northern Hemisphere?

I have read that the best time to view M81 is during the spring. Considering its RA is ~10h and Dec. is +69°, wouldn't February 21st be the best time to view it since this is about when it transits my meridian at midnight or are there other considerations?
I'm observing from Cleveland OH, USA area; 41.5° N, 81.7° W.
