Is the Alpha Centauri star system moving closer to us?

The closest star system after our sun is Alpha Centauri, a three star system with Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf, slightly closer to us than the other 2, around 4.3 light years. I tried Wikipedia and other articles that describe Alpha Centauri and there is plenty of information, but no where could a find an answer to said question.  
My presumption is that if the distance is measurable, so should the variance in this distance.
