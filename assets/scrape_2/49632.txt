civil twilight & sunset

Many Internet sources define civil twilight (hereinafter CT) as follows:
Any point in time at which the 'geometric center of the sun' is between 0°, inclusively, and 6°, exclusively, below the horizon relative to a fixed position and orientation on Earth's surface.
The same sources state that evening CT (ECT) begins with sunset. Sunset is defined, in effect, as 'the sun is desdcending and its upper limb just on the horizon'.
How can ECT begin with sunset then ?
If the sun is descending and its 'geometric center' passes the horizon, then ECT begins, but there's still some way to go until sunset, isn't it ?
