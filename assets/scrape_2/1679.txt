How do one identify something they see in the sky?

I've always wondered how someone looking at the sky into the enormous amount of stars and other things out there figures out that whether it is an already identified object or is he looking at something new? Is there some sort of tools like latitude and longitude to pin point something in the sky or some catalog where you can see if this is an identified object and what it is called, how it looks like and where it is located and all? 
As you might have guessed, I don't have any science background, just asking out of a common man's curiosity, so please be gentle with the jargon you use.
