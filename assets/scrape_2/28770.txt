What is the great (platonic?) year?

How could a great year be explained in laymen's terms?
According to the definition in NASA's Aerospace Dictionary  it is a complete cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic that completes in 26000 years:

GREAT YEAR.
The period of one complete cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic, about 25,800 years. Also called platonic year. See precession of the equinoxes.
NASA SP-7, 1965

Does this mean that every X years the March 21st and September 22nd will be in a different part of the zodiac and it will take 26000 years to make a full circle?
