How was the Sun formed?

Refer to the below minutephysics video, in which they say that in order to reach the Sun from earth, we must first stop revolving around the Sun ie make our tangential velocity zero, and then head straight for the sun, otherwise it is nearly impossible to reach the sun because even a very huge push towards the sun will either send us in an elliptical or hyperbolic orbit:-

If even a little bit of orbital speed tangentially, prevents something from falling into the sun, then I wonder how does the sun formed itself at the beginning? Because, most collapsing material probably would be having at least some tangential velocity with respect to the center.
