How common are telescopes with the finder scope on the right side?

Are there telescopes where the finder scope is mounted on the (upper) right of the body? Are they common? If not, are there any ways around this (e.g. can I mount a lightweight telescope "sideways")?
Background: I cannot close my left eyelid alone (without closing both). I can close my right eye just fine, leaving the left one open, but not the other way around.
Last year, I briefly owned a simple ~100€ refractor (which I returned because one of the eyepieces came in pieces and was not usable, but I still tried out the other) and only after assembling did the problem occur to me: to use the finder scope, which was on the upper left of the main body, I had to use the right eye and thus either use a hand to cover my left eye or leave both eyes open. I found both options rather inconvenient.
I am now looking for a telescope again (willing to spend a bit more, 200-400€), but product images I found so far do not clearly indicate on which side of the body the finder scope is located, or clearly indicate that it is also to the left. Are there any specific terms I need to look for?
