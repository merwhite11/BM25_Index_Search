Spectrum of star

I constructed a telescope and fixed my mobile's camera to the eye lens. I then viewed the sky via the mobile and I captured this image.

This is the magnified version of it:

I'm not sure if this actually the spectrum of a star because I feel like maybe the human oil secreted by my hands may have got stuck on the lens and that must've dispersed the light from some source. I'd like to know all of your views. Thanks.
