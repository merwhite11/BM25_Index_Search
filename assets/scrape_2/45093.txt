Can we say space contracts around a massive object in space?

Space expands on a cosmic scale. It makes objects accelerate away from each other, as observed.
Can we say, by the same token, that space contracts around massive objects in space, with the consequence that objects accelerate towards each other instead of accelerating away?
The difference being that expansion of space is driven by other stuff (dark energy) than the contraction (mass/energy)?
