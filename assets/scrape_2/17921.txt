Giant variation of the proposed eLISA mission using reflectors on Earth and the Moon possible?

I was thinking about the proposed ESA mission eLISA, which is essentially a space version of the LIGO experiment, and it occurred to me that trailing three satellites behind the Earth's orbit seemed excessively complicated in comparison to using a reflector on the ground and another on the moon (if I am not mistaken, there is even already a mirror on the moon, from the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment) and a single satellite. Is there not a geosynchronous orbit with a line of sight to the moon at all times? It seems to me the added range would provide better sensitivity. Provided you know the exact distance to the reflector, you can calculate individual frequencies for the Earth and Moon lasers, downconvert the faster frequency through a PLL of sorts, and still use the resulting data in an interferometry analysis. Is there something major I am missing here that would make this arrangement more difficult than the proposed eLISA mission? It seems to shift a lot of the physical risk and cost of the mission to computational costs, which by comparison are much, much cheaper.
