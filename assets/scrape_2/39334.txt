How many days a month can you see a moonrise during daylight?

For about 15 days before a Full Moon the moon rises during the day, and for about 15 days after a Full Moon the moon sets during the day. I think it might be possible at full moon for the moon to rise just before daylight ends, and to set just after the next daylight starts, on some occasions.
However not all of these rises/sets will be visible. Around dark moon, moonrise is lost in the rising sun, and moonset is lost in the setting sun.
Hence my question, how many can you actually see?
I know this depends on a lot of factors, so a range would be sufficient.
I think this is equivalent to asking, what elongation of the moon is needed for the moon to be visible? When both are above the horizon?
