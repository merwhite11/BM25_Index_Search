Can you see Pleiades and Sirius at the same time on the sky, from Greece?

I would like to know if you can see the Pleiades and Sirius in the sky at the same time, from Greece?
What time of the year would that be?
And I would be very greatful if someone knows an interactive starmap where I could see how that would look like.
