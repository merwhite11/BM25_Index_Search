Primordial supermassive black holes. How old are they?

I know that astronomers have detected supermassive black holes in the early universe. What was the age of the universe at which these black holes were detected?  In other words how long is it thought to take for these supermassive black holes to form and what are the mechanisms by which they formed, other than from supermassive stars?
