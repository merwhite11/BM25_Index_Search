How to mount a 2" filter to a DSLR or mirrorless camera?

I'm considering using a 2" filter for astrophotography with DSLR and mirrorless cameras. Filters are typically measured in mm, but I understand that a "2 inch" filter is really a 48mm filter.
Does this mean that 2" astro filters can be used with cameras with a typical 48mm step-up/down ring?
