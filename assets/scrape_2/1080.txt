Does anyone know why three of Jupiter's largest moons orbit in 1:2:4 resonance?

Three of the first four moons ever discovered outside of our own planetary sphere of gravitational influence orbit in very close to perfect resonance. Europa's orbit is almost exactly twice as long as Io's, and Ganymede's is almost exactly twice as long as Europa's. Perhaps it is just coincidence. If you look at enough random things, you start to see patterns that aren't necessarily there. But it would be a pretty big coincidence. When I see something like this in nature, I have to wonder if there is an underlying cause.
The ratios aren't quite exactly 2, so if there is a gravitational influence or something that pulls them into this resonance, the influence must not be overpowering enough to force exact resonance. Or maybe it is, given enough time, but "recent" collisions or the pull of other satellites in the system may have driven them a little bit off of their resonance. Has anyone studied this and found a probable reason for this phenomenon?
