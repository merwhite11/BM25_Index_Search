Are there any old/ancient star maps that we can compare to today’s and see drastic differences?

Stars move through the sky very slowly, which is not noticeable in a human lifespan. I’m aware of proper motion of Barnard's Star and things of the sort but I’d like to obtain a noticeable record of changes from 1000s of years ago.
There are old star maps I’ve seen online but it is hard to even understand what’s going on. Are there any sources that can explain it simply to me or even show side by side example of old/ancient and new/modern?
