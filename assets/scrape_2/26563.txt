Do we see stars from other galaxies (not Milky way) in the night sky with the naked eye?

I saw reports that only Andromeda Galaxy and Big/Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy stars could be visible with the naked eye (how many stars would be from them out of a few thousand visible?)
This question appeared because there are some very "sparse" galaxies (very few stars in them) and scientists say night sky in them is practically all black (starless)...
So is it true that 99,9% visible stars in the night sky (naked eye) are from the Milky Way only?
