How can Voyager have left the solar system while at the same time there are solar system objects much farther?

I'm aware of Where does the Solar System end? but this question is different because I'd like to focus on the specific announcement by NASA about the Voyager spacecraft "leaving the solar system".
How can Voyager 1 have left the Solar System if there are comets and other trans-Neptunian objects much further away, which orbit the Sun and which therefore are part of the Solar System? It seems deceptive to me that they keep making this claim.
NASA has made this claim here: August 2012 - Voyager 1 Left the Solar System.
