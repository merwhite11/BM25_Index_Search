Has the "Big Bang" theory been disproven?

The Space telescope has detected some mature Galaxies close to the edge of the Universe. That means that they had formed more than 13.8 billion years ago . If the Big Bang occurred, then we would see those Galaxies  just  beginning to form now, instead of being fully developed already. The telescope looks back in time. So going by this the "Big Bang" never happened.
I for one wasn't surprised when I heard this news because the "Big Bang" theory, never really made sense to me.
