Was the use of silver on 'optical' telescope mirrors more common in the past? Why?

In the past, weren't many astronomical telescope mirrors periodically removed and 'resilvered', and wasn't this actually done using silver?
I'm guessing that this is much less common now - new telescopes are so large and complex that routine invasive procedures like that needed for maintenance of a silver coating would not be acceptable, and mirrors in many if not most older telescopes would have been 'updated' to aluminum.
Was silver used in the past because aluminum coating was too technically difficult, or because silver has slightly better reflectivity in the red, or some other reason?
note: I'm only asking about 'optical' telescopes meaning NIR & Vis, not the longer wavelength IR telescopes where IR emissivity is a concern.
