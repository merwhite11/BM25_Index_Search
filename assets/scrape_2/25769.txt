Impact of inclined orbit satellite on a planet

If a satellite in an inclined orbit breaks up in orbit and multiple fragments hit a planet, do the individual fragments follow
1 a sinusoidal path
2 a geodesic ( or great circle curve)
3 a straight line
I'm having real problems trying to visualise this!
I realise the ground track of an inclined orbit follows a sinusoidal path but what happens when impacting a rotating planet?
