How does an object at L1 stay at L1?

I've recently been reading about the DSCOVR satellite, and I'm confused about it's orbit.
According to NOAA

A million miles away, DSCOVR orbits a unique location called Lagrange point 1, or L1. This point is a gravity neutral point in space, allowing DSCOVR to essentially hover between the sun and Earth at all times.

With it being at L1, it's orbit around the sun is slightly shorter than Earth's. So my uninformed gut feeling tells me it should orbit the sun in a few days less than Earth does, but it clearly doesn't.
How is this object at L1 kept at L1?
Could it be that the gravity of the Earth acting on it in a really convenient way? Or does it use fuel? What fuel? Or is it a property of the L1 point that I have misunderstood that an object will naturally stay there once in position?
