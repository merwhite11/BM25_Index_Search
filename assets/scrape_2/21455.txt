How are the elevations of the poles proportionate to distances of earth that have been traversed according to Copernicus

In chapter 2 of "The Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres" where Copernicus maintains that the Earth is spherical, the Edward Rosen translation of the book states that 

the elevations of the poles have the same ratio everywhere to the portions of the earth that have been traversed.

I'd like to know what Copernicus is referring to in the aforementioned piece of text and how it provides evidence for the spherical shape of the Earth.
