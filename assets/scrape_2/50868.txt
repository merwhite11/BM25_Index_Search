How has cosmic ray flux changed over time?

Is the flux of cosmic rays now greater than it was in past eras of the Universe, less than it was in the past, or is it roughly the same? Is the answer different depending on what type of cosmic rays we are considering (lower energy, higher energy, protons, heavy nuclei, etc.?)
