How clearly would I be able to see a galaxy with the naked eye if viewed from a "close" distance?

In images of other galaxies they look very bright and vivid against the blackness of space (example). If I was located a few tens of thousands of lightyears away from a galaxy, would I see something similar or would it be more like a slightly brighter smudge in space?
I'm wondering since it seems we can barely see the features of our own galaxy with the naked eye from earth.
Edit: I see that someone has downvoted the question, it would have been good to have some feedback! I realise the question might be a bit vague, but I thought it was interesting to know if galaxies would look as bright as we see them in the pictures.
