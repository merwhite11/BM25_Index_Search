Effects of a supernova shockwave or gravitational wave to a nearby planet's orbit?

I've been reading about recent reports regarding COCONUTS-2B, a planet with the longest orbital period known - 1.1 million years. As a previous question asked, What precisely leads to planets like COCONUTS-2B to orbit so far away from their host stars, 6000 AU in its case?, I'm wondering about a wider problem - the effects of supernova shockwaves and/or gravitational waves on the orbit of a celestial body. At what distance would be needed so that such a transient event would noticeably affect the orbit of a planet, perhaps by a mile?
