Do planets affect their stars beyond causing them to wobble?

Are there any situations in which the existence of a planet measurably affects its star, aside from orbital wobble?  I am curious about possible ongoing affects, not stuff that happened during stellar system formation. For example, I know there was a controversy a few years ago about whether planets cause their host stars to be lithium depleted, but don't know if that was resolved.
This question is inspired by some tangential comments on a physics question "Do solar panels act as an electrical load on the sun?".  I very much doubt there are any direct measurable affects of the Earth on the Sun, but I then started to wonder about systems with small stars (e.g. red or brown dwarfs) and very large planets. If their orbit is close enough, I assume the star might slowly strip the planet which could affect the star. Or as was suggested during the lithium controversy, planets might gravitationally affect the internal evolution of their host star. Or maybe there is some process I haven't thought of.
