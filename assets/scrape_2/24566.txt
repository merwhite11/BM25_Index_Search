How large could a second moon of Earth be?

Question in the title. Let's say that I have a lot of garbage- mined-out asteroids, spent nuclear fuel, satellite debris, and just general trash. Also safe ways to get these into Earth orbit. Instead of sending this into the Sun, Jupiter, or out of the Solar System's plane, what if I took some random quasi-satellite, put it a bit behind the Moon on its orbital path, and started piling garbage on it? 
How large could it get before bad things start happen to Earth? For example, tides drowning the coasts. I'm not going to consider collisions, because of (insert megacorp here) Moon Tethersâ„¢.
