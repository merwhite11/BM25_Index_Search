What percentage of meteors are visible to the naked eye?

I read on a box of Lucky Charms that there are nearly a million shooting stars every day. My initial reaction was, "that's obviously false." However, upon further research I discovered that "shooting stars" are just meteors, and there are, in fact, millions of meteors in our atmosphere daily.
However, according to the Wikipedia article linked above, most meteors are about the size of a grain of sand. I suspect that you couldn't actually see a meteor that small, and I personally wouldn't consider it a "shooting star" if it weren't visible.
So that has me wondering: what percentage of meteors are visible to the naked eye?
I assume whether a meteor is visible depends on factors such as time of day and light pollution, in addition to the size of the meteor. If possible, I would appreciate an answer that takes those factors into account. If that's not feasible, I would at least like to know what percentage of meteors are big enough to be seen in the middle of the night with minimal light pollution.
Note: This question/answer indicates that there are many meteors too faint to see, and that small meteors are more numerous than large meteors (I think it indicates that small meteors are exponentially more numerous, but I'm not sure because my math is rusty). This suggests that a high percentage of meteors cannot be seen with the naked eye. I would like to know just how high that percentage is.
