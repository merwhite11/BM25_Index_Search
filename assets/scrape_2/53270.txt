How to calculate solar ecliptic longitude

I would like to write a small script to calculate solar ecliptic longitude in relation to different locations and dates. For instance UTC + - 1...2 etc..
I know, solar ecliptic longitude is the position of the sun relative to the vernal equinox, in degrees clockwise 360 degrees over a year..
What do I have to keep in mind?
Thanx a lot!
