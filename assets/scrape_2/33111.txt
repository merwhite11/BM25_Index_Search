If all stars rotate, why was there a theory developed that requires non-rotating stars?

According to Penrose's research, a non-rotating star would end up, after gravitational collapse, as a perfectly spherical black hole. However, every star in the universe has some kind of angular momentum. 
Why even bother doing that research if that won't ever happen in the universe and does it have any implications for the future of astrophysics?
