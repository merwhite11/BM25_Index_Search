stellarium software: selective artificial satellite display

The Stellarium satellite plugin by default shows all the artificial satellites' orbits around Earth. Iâ€™d like to be able to view only certain satellites so that the view is not cluttered with every satellite in existence. Is there a means to create a custom satellite list, or view only relevant satellites?
