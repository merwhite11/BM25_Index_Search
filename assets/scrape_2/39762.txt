Confused about rubber sheet analogy!

How to resolve confusions on the rubber sheet analogy of the spacetime curvatures?
I am a newbie to spacetime curvature. I have watched several youtube videos on Einsteins GR and spacetime curvature where most people used the analogy of the rubber sheet and ball on the sheet. However, I cannot realize that rubber sheet analogy with my reality. For example,

The rubber sheet is a two dimensional sheet on the other hand I see our universe is a three dimensional.
The balls on the rubber sheet are placed from one direction to other (top to bottom) but in reality I see out planets and stars are flying on the space.
Light flows over the rubber sheets and curves around the balls in its world line, but in reality we know everything themselves are travelling with the speed of light in their world line.

How can I resolve these confusions? I am really interested to know detail about them.
