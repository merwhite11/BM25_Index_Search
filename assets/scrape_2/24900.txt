Need help understanding the recent observation of extra-galactic planets!

The new paper Probing Planets in Extragalactic Galaxies Using Quasar Microlensing (also in ArXiv) is too mind-boggling for me to understand exactly what is happening. 
I have some very basic understanding of gravitational microlensing from other Q&A here (and Wikipedia) but I can't figure out what is happening in this paper.
There are thousands of planets seen in another galaxy, which do not orbit stars? There is discussion of "emission close to the event horizon of the supermassive black hole of the background quasar"... there are too many unusual things going on at once for me to fathom.
Is it possible for someone to sort out the basics of what's happening? The Quasar is in front, and the galaxy containing these planets is behind? What emission?
