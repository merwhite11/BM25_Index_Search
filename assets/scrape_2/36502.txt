What is the magnification of my new telescope?

I just bought a Skywatcher telescope with a diameter of 60 mm and a focal length of 900 mm. I have a 2x Barlow lens and two eyepieces with focal lengths of 10 mm and 20 mm.
How can I calculate the magnification of my telescope, for example using the 2x Barlow and the 20mm eyepiece?
I'm fascinated by watching the sky and I can't wait to try it... Unfortunately, it's currently cloudy.
One more question; what I can see to be fascinated with this telescope?
