How does the Astronomical Twilight depend on the night length or the day length?

Some references say that the Astronomical Twilight starts at the last 1/8th of the night length, so it is long in Winter and short in Summer;
But by using the 18 angle (sun elevation below the horizon) the twilight is long in Summer and short in Winter!
What would be the correct method proven by observations for all days and all locations?
