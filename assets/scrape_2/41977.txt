Why was Neptune rather than Uranus chosen as an archetype?

The largest exoplanets are typically called Jupiter-like planets, or hot/cold Jupiters. Since Jupiter is the largest most massive planet in our Solar system, it makes sense that it would be chosen as an analog. For intermediate-size exoplanets, Neptune is used as an analog (e.g. 1).
Neptune and Uranus are both roughly the same size and mass. So why is Neptune rather than Uranus used as the archetype of intermediate-mass planets?
Did someone call an exoplanet a Neptune-like planet, choosing Neptune over Uranus for no particular reason, and then everyone else followed suit? Or is there a fundamental difference between the two planets that makes Neptune a better analog?
