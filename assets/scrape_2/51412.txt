Metonic cycle observation & display

I'm unable to locate physical display observatories for the 19 year Metonic cycle. How do I display this information & calendar detail on a concrete floor near the tropic of cancer?
I seek a floor display so the 19-year cycle can be marked by the full moon at 19 year, and other influx, peak, or minimum points. These points would be displayed at local lunar midnight during full moon. Perhaps calendar events like solstice & lunar months are available information as well.
I hope to display several inflection points in a measurements similar to the link posted by PM 2ring below. The camera obscura approach may not work, as I don't intend a cathedral height ceiling over the concrete.
The optical component and a floor component are both part of my question. I have not seen an example of what I'm trying to do, nor find examples of metonic display to copy.
The optical component may be a focusing device or lens to allow for non cathedral height (from floor to hole in roof). Do lensing schemes allow for movement multiplication? A normal height ceiling may not allow this approach.
The floor display that this would be projected onto would hold points where the lunar light would annotate its place in the cycle. The cycle map or maridan line itself would be a component of the floor, perhaps artwork of some sort.
As to the use of the term physical display; I hope to use  moonlight and possibly lenses to register the movement on the floor artwork. I have no display to copy, and don't understand what exact information the moon position provides during it's cycle. I understand the cycle, that data is available by phone. I want to see the display & lunar light physically interact.
The site is about 30 mi north (correction) of the tropic of Cancer. In Baja California.
