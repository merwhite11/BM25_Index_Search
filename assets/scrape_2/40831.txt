Is there a webpage that shows the night sky but can filter out dim stars?

This webpage is very good for viewing the night sky and learning the names of the stars

However, it shows too many stars. Because I live in the city, I can only see about 50 stars. If I could filter out all of the dim stars, that would help me focus on just the top 50 brightest stars. If I want to learn the names of the stars and how to identify them I have to start with the brightest. Yes, you can scroll over the star and it will tell you how bright it is, but that is very time-consuming.
