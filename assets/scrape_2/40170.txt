How to improve the precision in a star's distance

When I use the Gaia star catalogue, the parallax values often have large uncertainties which, therefore, leads to a large uncertainty for the distances to the stars.
If you were interested in the distance to one particular star and money was no object (i.e. you could buy time on any instrument) - what would be the optimum thing that could be done to improve the precision in the star's distance?
