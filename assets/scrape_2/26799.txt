Universe Sandbox 2 accurate representation of gravity

I've been playing Universe Sandbox for a while now and I have never been able to make a near Earth asteroid collide with it. By "make" I mean, simulating billions of years of known, near Earth objects until one of their orbits intersect. In this explanation Sir Cumference describes that Universe Sandbox 2 uses Newtonian physics to in its simulations. But wouldn't that calculate enough pull from Earth to slightly change the trajectory of the NEO to eventually impact?
We know, with almost 100% certainty that a LARGE NEO will impact Earth (probably sooner than later), otherwise why would we be investing so heavily on the Jet Propulsion Lab's Asteroid Watch program. 
Can the game not accurately simulate gravitational pull on those large scales or is there something else (probably a lot) I'm missing? Are all known NEOs not projected to have a relevant collision intersection with Earth?
