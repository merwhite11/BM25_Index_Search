Our Sun already a White dwarf?

I watch the discovery science channel a lot & enjoy the material about space, stars, planets, etc.  In one episode the narrator states our Sun will one day become a white dwarf star.  The size of our Sun will double and ultimately the Earth will be inside this enlarged Sun. This the end of all life on Earth.  Then I read a recent Snapple bottle cap that stated our Sun is really white.  I read it again and chuckled: is it already a White dwarf star at this point?  I take it that the original color of the star happens to be white.  How will we know when the Sun will become a White dwarf and increase in size the engulf the Earth? Basically what is the time frame in this context.
