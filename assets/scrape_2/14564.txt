How to calculate a planet's apparent size when the planet is viewed from a moon in orbit around it?

Specifically in this case, how large would Jupiter be seen in the Io's sky in comparison to the moon in the Earth's sky? How to calculate this?
Also, if somebody knows any online software which lets you input moons and planets to see how their sky looks like to also fill in the answer, it's appreciated.
