What constellations touch the 9-degree wide Zodiac?

Say Barry, could you abuse the answer-your-own-question feature of
this site, and answer the following question:
As noted in How many constellations in the Zodiac? the
ecliptic itself touches 13 constellations, but the Encylopedia
Brittanica defines the Zodiac as "a belt around the heavens extending
9 [degrees] on either side of the ecliptic":
http://www.britannica.com/topic/zodiac
The Old Farmer's Almanac for 2014 (and previous years) notes (page
114) that Moon occasionally crosses into 5 "non-Zodiac" constellations
at times:

So, exactly which constellations are "in the Zodiac" if the Zodiac
extends 9 degrees on either side of the ecliptic?
And why 9 degrees? I know Venus can be as much as 8.25 degrees from
the ecliptic,
