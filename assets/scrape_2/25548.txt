Does Gold really come from Supernovas?

Do we really know that the origin of gold was in a supernova explosion?
I am talking about the gold we find here on Earth.
So then how are we sure that Gold actually came from these explosions.  Did they go back some million years ago and figure out that Gold was made in supernova.
