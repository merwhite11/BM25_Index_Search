What are some methods that could do it like a pair of binoculars or a telescope would, without actually using either?

I'm an astronomy enthusiast in highschool. A partial solar eclipse will be visible from my country in 9 days, but it will take place during a school day. What are some projection methods that'll provide me the same image quality and size as using binoculars/scope would, without actually using either?
I already have eclipse glasses, but not enough of them as I was put in charge of eclipse viewing that day.
I've seen articles about mirror projection, but I would it be as sharp, large and bright?
