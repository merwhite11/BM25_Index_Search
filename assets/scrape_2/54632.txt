Could two celestial bodies with extreme magnetic fields affect each other's motion via magnetism?

Assume we have two objects that exist on a planetary / stellar scale.
It could be a pair of magnetars, black holes, or really really big neodymium magnets. All that matters is the scale, and the magnetism.
What happens when the magnetic fields of these objects interfere? Is it possible to observe a change in motion that resists gravity? Do they tear each other apart?
And, most importantly, Have we observed an interaction like this?
