Can you recommend a book about big bang nucleosynthesis and chemical abundances?

I am interested in learning about big bang nucleosynthesis, nuclear fusion up to iron in stellar cores and beyond iron in supernovas, and into the lithium problem (galactic abundance anomoly for atomic numbers 3,4,5). As these topics are interlinked, I have been hoping to find good resources on the subject. Can anyone recommend a good source for self-study? In case it's relevant (regarding difficulty level), I'm a physics grad student lacking exposure to related topics.
