Can a black hole "supernova"?

In layman terms:

nothing ever escapes the pull of a black hole, not even light
when a super massive star reaches the end of it's life you get a supernova
sometimes the "remains" of these stars can turn turn into black holes

My question is: can a black hole "supernova" the same way a large star does?
What I'm saying is, could this process occur in reverse? I.E:

black hole -> supernova -> particles form dust cloud -> new star

EDIT: Apologies if any of this sounds stupid (or vague), I'm just curious.
