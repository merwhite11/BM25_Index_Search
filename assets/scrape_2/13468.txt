Best planets profile for a tattoo of the solar system

I want to get a tattoo of the solar system. The gap between the planets should not be preserved and the differences in sizes will only be symbolic. 
My question is if all planets were to align, do we know what side of the planets would be shown? If not, where can I find a profile picture of which side of the planet it will show?
