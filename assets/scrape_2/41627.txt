Why do massive rapid-rotating stars move bluewards off the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS)?

I'm reading a well-cited paper by Szecsi et al. 2015 titled "Low-metallicity massive single stars with rotation". The paper can be found here. I was surprised that figure 5 depicted an HRD in which rapid rotators of 500 km/s evolved bluewards on the HRD. I didn't know any star could move anything but rewards when leaving the ZAMS. Other rotators below that 500 km/s move in a more typical fashion. Can anyone explain what is going on here?
