Singularity at the time of origins

According to the big Bang Theory, the universe have started from a point and it describes how the universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state.The initial singularity was a singularity of infinite density thought to have contained all of the mass and space-time of the Universe. If it was so dense,  why didn't it engulf the other parallel universes just like a supermassive black hole? 
If there are no other universes,  why the existing black holes didn't suck the entire universe yet?
