Planet with acid ice caps

I remember reading an old astronomy book mentioning a certain planet and the main point of interest was that this planet has or may have polar ice caps but of acid. I can't remember the name though, what planet or planets fit this description? 
Now there some very strange worlds out there though I'm unsure whether this one may or may not be all that strange. Is this something of an oddity or is a planet containing frozen acid not that uncommon?
