Why does iron consume more energy in the fusion process than it produces?

I understand that once a star starts fusing iron, it's doomed to collapse because iron fusion requires more energy than it releases in the process, allowing the opposing gravity of the star to cause it to collapse.
But why?  What makes iron special in this way?  It seems to occupy a pretty inconsequential spot in the middle of the period table among the transition metals.  So, why is it that iron breaks the rule in play for all the elements before it when it comes to fusion?
I noticed that on another question someone said that it wasn't iron, but nickel that was the first element that required more energy to fuse than it released- but every documentary and book I've read claims that it's iron.  So, if you're answer is "iron isn't the first element that requires more energy..." please explain why every other source I've ever heard is wrong!
