How to compute rising / setting times for stars and deep sky objects with Skyfield?

I'm trying to compute rising and settings times for various objects with the Skyfield library. While the task is quite easy and well documented for planets (using the almanac.rising_and_setting function), it is not too clear to me how to do this with Stars and Deep Sky Objects.
Btw, how do I load NGC catalogues?
