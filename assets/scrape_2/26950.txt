How come moon's difference in thickness between sides does not create an unbalance on its mass?

I've just found out that moon's dark side is 30 miles thicker then the closer side to the Earth. So I'm wondering about moon's mass. How come it's still balanced? Supposing the far side is indeed heavier, considering More Mass More Gravity, wouldn't it have to be closer to Earth?
Sorry if I'm making stupid assumptions, I'm just a curious fela.
