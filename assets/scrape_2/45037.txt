is there any excuse or reason why our bubble in Hawking's space-time foam theory is retained?

Hawking said that universes are like bubbles that pop into existence and pop back into the vacuum some form then immediately pop, he calls this space-time foam, our bubble doesn't seem to pop immediately after it's formed, is there a reason for our bubble staying so long, is it because we're simply too tiny to notice?
