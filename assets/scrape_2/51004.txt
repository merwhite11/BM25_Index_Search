How do I determine the Luminosity with a half-life decay?

I know there is a proportionality between the luminosity and $\frac{dN}{dt}$, but I am not sure why they are proportional and why there is a need for an initial mass to compute the luminosity if the half-life equation is:
$N(t) = N_{0} \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^{t/t_{half-life}^{1/2}}$
and how does this apply to supernovae?
I tried to use Cobalt decay to help me understand, but I do not see how to progress from:

$\frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{N_{0}}{N(t)} \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^{t/t_{half-life}^{1/2}}$
