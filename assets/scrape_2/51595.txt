How is Halley's comet still in one piece?

According to the first answer of This question parts of Halley's comet hit the Earth every spring as part of the Eta Aquarid meteor shower. If this is true, then how is the comet still in one piece? If parts of this thing are breaking off every year as it travels through space, that means the comet must be getting smaller. If I am not mistaken, a comet can only be so big.
This question addresses just how, in all the time Halley's comet has come back before, and broken parts off of itself each time, can it still be in one piece.
