Are there any simulations of the Grand tack?

The BBC program with Brian Cox "The Planets" involved some description of the Grand Tack hypothesis to explain the current state of the solar system.
This theory has Jupiter wandering through the solar system causing various orbital disruptions. Are there any computer simulations/CGI videos available to show how Jupiter may have achieved this? On a sightly unrelated note: I recall reading Velikovsky's "Worlds in collision" many years ago. He had a similar idea but attempted to attribute these changes to biblical events / comets. He was many orders of magnitudes out in terms of timing and the size of the disruption, but I suppose he could be credited with hinting that Geological uniformitarianism might not be applicable to the solar system.
