Can Space-Time Itself Have Energy Qualities Like Momentum?

Hypothetically, if space could be moved or scaled, what would happen to everything inside?
I'd like to know if an element of momentum could be transferred to objects by contorting space-time.
Other than gravity, what effects does space-time contortion have on mass?
