How do astronomers distinguish between Cepheids and other types of variable stars?

So my understanding of how Cepheid is used as standard candle to determine distance of galaxies is like this: Astronomers observe a galaxy, notice an object within that galaxy whose brightness pulsates periodically, measure its period, translate it into luminosity by using Cepheid period-luminosity relationship, and get the distance from the modulus.
But how do they confirm that object really is a Cepheid and not another type of variable (say, RR Lyrae) that may have different (or even nonexistent) period-luminosity relationship? Is there any observable properties that is unambiguously unique to Cepheids?
