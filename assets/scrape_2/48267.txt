How to calculate the local time of sunrise and azimuth of rising point of Sirius?

I know that right ascension equals to $6^h45^m$ and declination equals to $-16Â°43'$. I need to calculate local time of sunrise and azimuth of rising point of Sirius on 23 of September for an observator located on the equator. So that means $\phi = 0$. Should I use sunrise equation:
$\cos \omega _{\circ }=-\tan \phi \tan \delta$
or is there another way?
