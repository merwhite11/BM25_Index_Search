Does an algorithm exist that takes an image of the night sky and tell you where in the milky way that perspective likely originates?

In Stargate they talk about using the stars on other planets to figure out their location. I know that's fiction, but it made me wonder if such an algorithm (with arguably little usefulness right now) exists.
