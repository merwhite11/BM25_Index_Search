When stars explode after running out of fuel, why are new stars born from the remnants?

I'm not a physicist or have a very good physics background but I've often wondered why there are new stars that are born in the nebula which was created after the parent star has exploded. As I understand, a star (at least those which have enough mass) explodes after it runs out of fuel, or when the core inside the star starts to fuse iron. So how can new stars be born when the nebula does not have any hydrogen in it?
I am probably missing something but this question interests me very much, and I can't seem to find any valuable information which would explain to me the answer to my question.
