Was the young Sun cooler or hotter than it is today?

Generally, astrophysicists say that the young Sun was only about 70% as warm as today, which leads to the alleged 'Faint young Sun paradox' about how a young Earth could have been as warm as it (again, allegedly) was....
BUT, other astrophysicists say the early Sun was MORE radiative, which leads to the alleged 'paradox' of Earth's water source(s)...  (I.e., how Earth could have gotten its water many years AFTER its formation, because the energetic young Sun's radiation meant the inner solar system was hot and dry...)
Huh?    Which was it?

Earth, then coalescing from dust and gas in this region, thus began as a dedicated rock.
