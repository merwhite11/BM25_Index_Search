What are Ellerman bombs and how can we identify them?

Have you ever heard about Ellerman bombs? Spaceweather.com talks about them on their news page. You could see some of them around sunspot AR2835:


Ellerman bombs are magnetic explosions about one-millionth as powerful as true solar flares. They are named after physicist Ferdinand Ellerman who studied the tiny blasts in the early 20th century. Of course, "tiny" is relative. A single Ellerman bomb releases about $10^{26} {\rm ergs}$ of energy--equal to about 100,000 World War II atomic bombs.

My question: Is the term Ellerman bombs really used widely used? Is there a commonly accepted definition? Also: How exactly have their locations been identified in the picture above?
