Planetary phase angle of Hohmann transfer

This is Question 23 from USAAAO First Round 2015. The answer is D. Can someone show how to get the answer?

Calculate the planetary phase angle (counterclockwise from Earth, a =
1.0 AU) that a probe may correctly complete a Hohmann transfer orbit to Venus (a = 0.7 AU)

a. 141 degrees
b. 17.5 degrees
c. 121 degrees
d. 241 degrees
e. 343 degrees


What I tried:

Semimajor axis of Hohmann orbit: 0.85 AU
Period of Hohmann orbit: 0.7836 yr
Time of flight: 0.3918 yr
Period of Venus: 0.5856 yr
Angular distance travelled by Venus during flight: 241°

The last one looks suspiciously similar to the answer, but using that angular distance the phase angle should be 61°. Feel free to correct me anywhere that I’m wrong
