Could images of (very) nearby targets be recovered from Event Horizon Telescope data?

Reading this question I was struck by the fact that the "pointing" of an interferometer is effectively done in the correlator, at least within the common field of view of all the telescopes, which is many thousands of times wider than the imaged area. Could the same data be reprocessed to reveal images of other "tiles" from this common field of view? Could it image the accretion disk, for example, or the base of the jets? Are there any targets that are close enough and bright enough to be worth doing this?
