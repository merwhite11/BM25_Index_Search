Compute Distance Between Stars

If I have the following information about star A and Star B, how can I compute the distance between A and B?

Distance from Sol for Star A
Right Ascension/Declination of Star A
Parallax/Absolute Magnitude of Star A
Distance from Sol for Star B
Right Ascension/Declination of Star B
Parallax/Absolute Magnitude of Star B

I can use the parallax and absolute magnitude to compute distance from Sol, but I don't know how to get the distance between A and B.
Obviously there will be errors in the parallax, but I'm looking for a best effort means to calculate this.
Edit
I've implemented this in Java and made it available via this link:

I realize for actual science work most people wouldn't use Java, but this is for a project that is part of my Java portfolio.
