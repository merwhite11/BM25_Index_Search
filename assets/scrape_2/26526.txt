Where can I find source data for the graph of metric expansion over time, as shown in this ESA web page?

This web page from ESA/Hubble, shows the size of the universe over time. (I know that "size of the universe" is a gross simplification and open to multiple definitions and ambiguity, but this kind of graph is roughly what I'm after).
But no source data is cited. This is the closest I can find to what I'm after - where can I find source data to match this graph?
