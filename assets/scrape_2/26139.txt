Amateur radioastronomy: dish suggestions

What kind of amateur radioastronomy can any interested citized do with:
a) A 2 m dish antenna.
b) A 2,5 m antenna.
c) A 3 m antenna.
d) A 5 m antenna. 
e) A >5 m <10 m antenna (likely I can not afford this or the previous but I just want to know...).
Of course, space is sometimes a logistic issue for big stuff, but I wondered what kind of objects or sources can someone do with suitable instruments and with aid enough if not an expert. Projects and links would be welcome!
