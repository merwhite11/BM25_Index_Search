Is it possible to detect gravitational lensing of stars behind the Moon?

Eddington waited for a total solar eclipse to happen to be able to observe gravitational lensing of the stars behind the Sun. And nowadays, amateurs can do the same thing.
Of course, the Moon is much less massive than the Sun, so it doesn't bend light as much. But since Eddington's time, our observation capabilities have greatly increased. Is it possible to detect the gravitational lensing of stars that are behind the Moon?
