Assuming proton decay is false, what's the ultimate fate of a neutron star or white dwarf?

A still unproven theory that protons can decay, and have a halflife of $10^{30}$ years or so, meaning eventually all matter will dissolve because their constituent protons and therefore neutrons will decay. But this is yet to be proven. So assuming this is false, what would be the ultimate fate of a neutron star or white dwarf? What would become of it in $10^{50}$, $10^{100}$ years?
