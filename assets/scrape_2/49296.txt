Difference between NSBH and BHNS mergers

What's the difference between Neutron Star-Black Hole Merger (NSBH) and Black Hole-Neutron Star Merger (BHNS)? Are they the same names for the same events or is there any difference between them?
I have seen the two terms in the following papers: A Brief Overview of Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers (BHNS) and Gotta catch â€™em all: the first neutron star-black hole merger detection! (NSBH)
