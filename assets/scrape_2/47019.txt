Would a telescope substantially away from the ecliptic plane improve TNO detection?

There have been lots of new TNOs found in the last decade.
Would a telescope far from the ecliptic plane be useful to image them, and spot new ones?
What about planet nine, assuming it exists: would it markedly improve the odds of finding it? Would it provide important images?
