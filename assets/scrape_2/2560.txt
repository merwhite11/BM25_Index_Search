Did the Babylonians believe in the Heliocentric version?

It's mentioned that the Babylonians decreed that there were exactly 360 days in a year. This statement was based upon the utilization of 360 as a standard (based on the sexagesimal system) i.e., they divided the circle into 360 equal parts.
Although, there is a mention about the Sun making one full circle across the sky in one year (as estimated by them), but, how were they able to measure it? And did they believe in the Heliocentric version of the solar system?
