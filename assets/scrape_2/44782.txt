What are the benefits of collecting asteroid samples in situ rather than just waiting for bits of asteroids to fall as meteorites?

Hayabusa and Hayabusa2 are sample return missions from asteroids. But little bits of asteroids fall to Earth all the time as meteorites. Why can't we just study those? What are the advantages of going to get a sample off the surface of an asteroid? What can we learn from collecting samples in situ that we can't guess from studying the stuff that falls down to Earth?
