Could inhomogeneities or topological defects break the fundamental symmetries of the Universe?

I have heard that some types of inhomogeneities and topological defects in cosmology have been proposed to be able to break fundamental symmetries of nature such as the Poincar√©, Lorentz, diffeomorphism CPT, spatial/time translational (etc) symmetries. However, I have not been able to find any references about this. Is this true? Is there anything about this?
