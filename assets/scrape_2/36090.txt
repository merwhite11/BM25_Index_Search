How frequently do Jupiter & Regulus have triple conjunctions?

I am wanting to know if the triple conjunction of Jupiter with Regulus in:
Sep 10, 3 BC
Feb 7, 3 BC &
May 8, 2 BC 
with Jupiter later having a conjunction with Venus in Jun 17, 2 BC has happened since, and if so, how often does this triple conjunction happens?
