If quasars are powered by black holes, why are they so bright?

If a black hole can swallow everything, even light, then how can a black hole power anything, particularly something as bright as a quasar. Why doesn't the black hole swallow the light of the quasar?
Are quasars formed when two black holes combine? 
I assumed it might be like an orange when we press it from middle then its juice comes out from both ends.
Is my assumption right...or is there another reason?
