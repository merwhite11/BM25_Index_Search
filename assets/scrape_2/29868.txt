Why the more-luminous star has larger surface area when two stars have the same temperature?


If two stars have the same temperature but one is more luminous than
  the other, the more-luminous star must have a larger surface area, and
  therefore a larger radius than the dimmer star. 

The light density of the two stars is obviously different. Must the brighter star have more lights?
