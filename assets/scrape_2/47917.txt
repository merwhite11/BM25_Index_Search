Why does a timelapse video of a stationary Milky Way make the horizon appear to move from horizontal to vertical?

In this video, with a rotating camera keeping the Milky Way 'stationary,' the horizon appears to transition form horizontal to nearly vertical.  


I understand the Earth rotates and that it is tilted on its axis as it does so.
However, I can't quite wrap my head around why the visual should have the angle of the horizon change like this.
Can anybody provide an explanation for this perspective?  It would be much appreciated.
