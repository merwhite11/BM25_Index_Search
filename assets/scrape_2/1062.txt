At what distance from Earth would our Sun be the same apparent magnitude as the next brightest star in the sky?

When I stand outside looking at the night sky, to my untrained eye, everything except the moon looks like a star.  I know intellectually that some are planets circling our sun, and some are entire galaxies far away, but they all look basically the same.
How far out do you have be be from our sun for it to appear the same as any other 'star' in the sky? 
Edit to clarify
As we migrate out through the solar system, when we look up to the sky the sun will get dimmer the farther away we get. On earth there is no doubt which star is our sun. 
As we occupy bodies in the solar system farther from the sun, where will we be when the sun appears to be the same brightness as any other star in the sky?
