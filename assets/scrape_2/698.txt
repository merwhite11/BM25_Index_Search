Is the moon rotation at complete standstill?

Moon always faces Earth with one side, its spin period equal its orbital period - this is what we learn at school.
But I know Nature rarely operates in absolutes. I'd find it hard to believe Moon wouldn't spin relative to Earth at least very slowly. I searched but found no data other than "doesn't", so I'd like to ask - does the Moon stay turned the same side precisely - or do, over many years, new features show at one edge? If it does, how long would it take to make a full turn?
