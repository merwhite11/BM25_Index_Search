Why search for water?

Most of the news about extraterrestrial search focuses on possibility for existence of water and temperatures like earth. Why do scientists feel this would lead them to extraterrestrial life? 

After all, we are searching for something that doesn't exist on earth. Why do we assume it would have behavior like us? Maybe the matrix inside their cells is of acetone or something else. Water may not play the role in their lives as it does for us. Maybe they can sustain high temperatures, maybe they can live in extreme cold. Why should we look for earth-like planets, isn't there a baseless (of course it's not baseless, there must be some logic which I want to know) assumption that the aliens are human-like (or any species on earth)?
