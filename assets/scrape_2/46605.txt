Have we indirectly measured GW driven orbital decay in anything besides binary pulsars?

Binary systems decay for all sorts of reasons.  I'm asking specifically about orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission.
All of direct GW detections of binary systems have come with orbit change measurements (the GW frequency chirp), but that's not what I'm asking about.
Binary pulsar systems, usually binary neutron star or neutron star-white dwarf, are great for precise orbital measurements, and in a handful of these systems folks have measured the change in the system's orbital period $\dot{P}_B$ due to gravitational wave emission.

Are there any other systems where GW driven orbital decay has been observed?
Is it possible to optically observe a tight double white dwarf and get that kind of orbital evolution precision?
What about galactic center objects orbiting Sag A$^*$?  Are the dynamics modeled as Keplerian orbits?  Do any of closer encounters require post-Keplerian corrections like $\dot{P}_B$?
