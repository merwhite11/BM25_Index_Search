Why is the metallicity of elliptical galaxies low?

As far as I understand, metallicities of old stars are usually low and those of new stars are usually high.
If elliptical galaxies form after merger of galaxies, then surely that means the elliptical galaxy passed through a stage where it was an irregular galaxy. Now, irregular galaxies are said to be sites of rapid, new star formation.
Why then do we say that elliptical galaxies have low metallicity, if the star formation went on for a long time there?
