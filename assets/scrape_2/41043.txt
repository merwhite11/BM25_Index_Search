What is the upper bound of number of stable interacting stars in a star system?

I remember very well reading in an article that it's impossible to have a stable star system of 4 or more stars. The article justified its claim discussing about the complexity such systems would have in terms of mass, velocity and distance to be stable. Further more I think there was a constriction related to our 3-dimensional universe, unless I confuse it with an other article about why solar systems cannot form in 4 dimensions... I don't remember though where I read the article.
And since then I thought there couldn't be star system with more than 3 stars and that belief was enforced with the movie Contact when Jody Foster traveled through space and encountered a quadruple star system. What an opportunity for a movie to claim the existence of something so exotic, right?
Recently there's been a fuss about the TIC 168789840 six-tuple system. So either I'm very behind in astronomy news or I confuse the terms Star System and Solar System in the article I read...
Here an article about the aforementioned system.
