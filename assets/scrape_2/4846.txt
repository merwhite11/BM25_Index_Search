What is the explanation for rapid inflation just after the big bang?

I often hear about cosmic inflation occurring rapidly after the Big Bang, but have never came across any explanation for it. What supposedly caused this inflationary period in the early universe? Also, my assumption is that the laws of physics, i.e. light speed and relativity, did not exist during inflation, but were after effects. Is that a correct assumption? Thanks!
