Have interference effects (in space) ever been observed by a single instrument, as opposed to interferometry?

Not asking about:
Interferometry can be done with multiple instruments who's light paths or signals are combined interferometrically, or even between different parts of a single aperture, e.g.

What equipment and techniques were used to study Betelgeuse's diameter in 1920?
How did Michelson measure the diameters of jupiter's moons using optical interferometry?
Why does the Simbad page "A.A. Michelson's Jovian Galilean-satellite interferometer" show data for Betelgeuse?

Asking about:
For example comment under Is Diffraction of light observed in gravitational lensing/microlensing? links to Studying wave optics in the light curves of exoplanet microlensing At the longer wavelengths observed via radio telescopes, the authors propose that interference fringes (in time) between a lensed and un-lensed path for light from a given object can be observed at Earth, thereby increasing the amount of detailed information that can be modeled in order to better characterize the lensing event.
That's an example what I would consider as "interference effects (in space)... observed by a single instrument, as opposed to interferometry".
Question: Have any such effects been observed?
