How to create unique 3d star maps?

I have been trying to create a calculator which finds the distance between two stars that the user chooses. But I'm having a hard time visualizing where these stars are in real space. Do you know of any software that could actually help me crate a star map with only the stars in my calculator? I know of some star maps like Celestia, but I would like to be able to create my own map that only contains certain stars. If there isn't anything, I can find my own solution. Thanks in advance for any answers!
