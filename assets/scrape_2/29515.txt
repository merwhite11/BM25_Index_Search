What would happen to the solar system if Earth's mass was removed?

This question is inspired by the "Stargate SG-1" episode "The Road Not Taken". In that story a device is used to shift the entire Earth to another dimension to defend against an attack.
I'm not asking about the science of whether that is even theoretically possible but rather the effect on the rest of the objects in our solar system if it did happen. Since this was apparently a short shift (likely days at the most) I would imagine there might be little overall effect to most things but it occurred to me the Moon might immediately start drastically altering its position relative to the now massless Earth (there was no indication that the effect extended to the Moon but given that ships very close to Earth were unaffected it would seen that the Moon was also unaffected) so that when the Earth returns to "normal" it may no longer be in Earth's orbit or worse, Earth may rematerialize partially within or completely around it.
