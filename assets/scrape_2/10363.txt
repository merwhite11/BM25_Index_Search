Binary stars system ultimate fate

I read an article mentioning that when two stars orbiting each other they'll produce gravitational waves that can carry away energy into space. These phenomenon increases the speed of the two orbiting stars and draws them closer to each other until they finally collided, is it true that gravitational waves can carry away energy into space?
