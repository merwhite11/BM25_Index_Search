Is the sun flipped on the other side of the world?

As the orientation of the moon is different in the northern and the southern hemisphere, is the orientation of the sun different in both hemisphere? 
Does a sunspot appearing in the Sun northern hemisphere from the Earth northern hemisphere will look as located in the Sun southern hemisphere from the Earth southern hemisphere ? 
If I understand well, an equatorial mount can compensate for the Earth tilt, but how is possible to compensate from one hemisphere to the other one? Is the image flipped?
thank you!
