What is the actual black hole merger speed?

I have seen models of 2 black hole mergers.

When we see a space ship appear to be frozen in time as it approaches the event horizon then would a back hole merger be faster then perceived in our time? 
John put it well in the comments:  People say merging black holes end up moving at half the speed of light, but don't say anything about the gravitational time dilation wherein the "coordinate" speed of light goes to zero at the event horizon. Which would mean black holes would have to be moving faster than the local speed of light. How can this be right? 
Can things move faster than light inside the event horizon of a black hole?
