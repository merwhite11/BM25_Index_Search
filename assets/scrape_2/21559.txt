Could we see planets around active Stellar Mass Black Hole?

This question is a followup of Is there any theoretical or empirical research about planetary systems with a black hole in their center?; 
Since it is possible to detect planets around stars with the change of light they cause, I would think it should also be possible to detect them when they orbit around an active Stellar Mass BH.
From what I (can) understand from the first answer, there is no known case of planets orbiting around Stellar Mass BH. What could be preventing us to observe it?

Is there too few active Stellar Mass BH close enough for us to have a chance the system's plan is well aligned with us? 
Do we only see Stellar Mass BH when they have a stellar companion feeding them, and this discards to possibility for close-by planets?
Or is it because the light we can see from them is too fast-changing for a wobble or transition to be observable with today telescopes?
