A neutron star without a flat surface and an atmosphere?

In the Kurzgesagt video Atoms As Big As Mountains â€” Neutron Stars Explained they state that neutron stars have an atmosphere that reaches about 10 centimeters above the surface. 
How is this possible? Wouldn't the strong surface gravity pull all of the material onto the surface of the star?
Further, Kurzgesagt also states that the neutron star has a surface variation of about 5mm. Still, wouldn't gravity pull it flat? Of is the gravity not strong enough to do so?
