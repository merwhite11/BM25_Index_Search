Using Tully Fisher to measure Distance Problem

Can anyone explain by looking at the solution in the pic, how did the cos (i) came about?
I guess they are getting this from the major-minor axis info in the question, but I am not sure about the derivation.
Also v=300/sin(i), what is this formula?
Many thanks :)
