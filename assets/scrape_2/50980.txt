How much cosmic dust is there in the asteroid belt?

I've tried looking on google but I've found nothing that directly answers my question. I've found that around Earth there is around 1000 grains in every cubic kilometre, but I'd assume that there is more in the asteroid belt, due to the presence of asteroids and lack of a planet to collect them up
