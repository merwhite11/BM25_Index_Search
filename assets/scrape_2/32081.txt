Trans-Neptunian Dwarf Planet near Heliopause

Is there any reason to think a Trans-Neptunian dwarf planet, the size of Pluto, could not exist in a Keplerian orbit 120AU from the Sun?
If such an object existed, and came within 0.1AU of the heliopause, is there anything about the environment near the heliopause that would prevent a stable orbit.
