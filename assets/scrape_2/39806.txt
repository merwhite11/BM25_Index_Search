Relation between absolute magnitude of UV and star formation rate

I surfed the internet and searched a lot of sites,
so far I got this

but unable to find the formula which relates only Muv and the Ψ as I don't know the value of parameters Auv and μ(z).
If there exists any such formula, then do help!
