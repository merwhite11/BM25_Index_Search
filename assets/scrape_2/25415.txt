What might the surface of Jupiter's rocky core look like?

Jupiter is posited, in some models, to have a rocky core about the size of a few Earths.  If we could see through the thick gaseous atmosphere, what topographical features might we find on the rocky core?  I know that no probe has ever sent data from Jupiter's (hypothesized) solid surface, and that orbiters probably can't penetrate the clouds to produce a topographic map, but do we at least have any educated guesses as to what sort of surface features are and are not likely to exist?  For example, given Jupiter's massive gravity, would the surface be extremely smooth?  Or would it not be out of the question to observe things like impact craters or mountain ranges?
