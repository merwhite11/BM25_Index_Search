How could we observe a wormhole?

A wormhole is a sort of tunnel that could connect two points in spacetime. These are theoretical objects that have not been observed. What observational evidence could we look for to confirm (or disprove) their existence? If they do exist, what should we be looking for to find one?
This answers how wormholes could be created. This is not what I'm asking about. I want to know what observations could be done (potentially with telescopes we don't have yet) to confirm the existence of wormholes.
