Are there known centaurs which orbit between Jupiter and Saturn without crossing their orbits?

According to Centaur minor planet

Centaurs are small Solar System bodies with a semi-major axis between those of the outer planets. They generally have unstable orbits because they cross or have crossed the orbits of one or more of the giant planets

Of all the known ones which I've found and I've seen data, all of them overlaps the orbit of Saturn, with the exception of  (514107) 2015 BZ509 which doesnt overlap the orbit of Saturn but the orbit of Jupiter. 
My question is, are there known centaurs which dont overlap the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn but which orbit between those 2 orbits? Or does the definition of Centaur mean they have to cross orbits and an asteroid orbiting between those 2 orbits would be called another name if exists?
