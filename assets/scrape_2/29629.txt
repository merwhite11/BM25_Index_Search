Historical Distance of Planets to Earth

I'm curious if there is a readily accessible tool available, or simply a reliable way to find out what the distance of the planets in the solar system were on a given date.
For example, if I am trying to determine how far:

The Sun
Mercury
Venus
Mars

were from Earth on May 3, 1954 ... how would I do that?
