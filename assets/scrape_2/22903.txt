What would it feel like to be orbiting near a merging black hole?

The recent 4th discovery of gravitational waves where the black hole masses were 31 and 25 times the mass of the sun, and they released 3 solar masses of energy as gravitational waves, made me wonder what would it feel like to be orbiting this binary black hole system on a planet at 1AU when the merger happened?
