Generate probability skymap

I am trying to generate skymaps for a set of Fermi GBM triggers, containing the probability that a trigger originated in a given part of the sky.  For each trigger, I have access to the RA, dec, error radius, and reliability values.
This website is a perfect example of what I am trying to do.  There is a table with with RA, Dec, error, and reliability values, which were used to generate maps (sample).  My question is, how was this done?
My understanding of the problem is that I must first generate fits files based on the data, and then use either a python library or external program to render the skymap from the file.  
I have already looked at both healpy and astropy, which provide a means to create and manipulate fits files.  Creating a blank fits file is easy, but I am at a loss as to how to populate the files I generate with relevant probabilities based on the data I have access to. Any help, even just a pointer in the right direction, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.
edit- description of the error radius parameter: 

This parameter is the uncertainty in the position, in degrees. The GBM errors are not symmetric, and the given value is the average of the error ellipse.

This is what results in the asymmetrical blob shapes.
