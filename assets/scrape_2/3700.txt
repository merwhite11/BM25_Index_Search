Sum of the Masses of All Moons in the Solar System

I'm looking for the total mass of the moons in the solar system in Earth Mass
this would be include the 67's moons of jupiter, the 62's of saturn, the 27's Uranus and the 14's for Neptune.
it's a crazy question I know, if you have some list of the object with mass in same range i can make the addition ^^
