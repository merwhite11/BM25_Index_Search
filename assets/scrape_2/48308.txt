Could or has a Ninth planet ever be "formed" in our solar system?

As I get along with the answers in my previous question, that planet formation depends on accumulation of planetesimals. So is there any chance that a planet nine would form or any of the Trans-Neptunian Object, "evolve" into a planet in or near the Kuiper Belt, which is thought to be a belt of planetesimals?
Although we don't know fully about the Kuiper belt, what can we conclude from the information and models we have now.
