In theory, is there anywhere in the universe where velocity=0?

Earth is traveling at a certain velocity.  Earth orbits the Sun at velocity X.  The sun is orbiting the center of our galaxy at velocity Y.  The galaxy is orbiting (something?) at velocity Z. On and on... 
In relation to zero, Earth has a velocity of X + Y + Z + (?).
Is it theoretically possible that there would be a point in space where nothing is moving and velocity is essentially 0?  
If so, what would time look like at this point in space?
