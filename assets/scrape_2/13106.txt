When I read that a system is located x light years away, why is there no direction?

Well, I just read an article about a galaxy with two black holes, and it stated that the galaxy is 1 billion light-years away. Why is there no direction given? If the Big Bang happened, and things are moving away from each other, we can still have at least two directions - away from the center, and to it. Is that a right way to think about space and our drift in space?
