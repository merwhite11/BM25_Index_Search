How can we be certain that Ryugu is a remnant of the material that did not form planets?

As mentioned here, that Ryugu is a part of the Solar System material that did not get swept into forming a planet.
But how can we be sure that it was not created later for example by an asteroid striking Mars or some other planet? Why do we think its "primordial"?
