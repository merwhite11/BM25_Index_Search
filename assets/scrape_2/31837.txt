how to define the universe itself is expanding greater than than the speed of light?

since we observe galaxies and other steller objects in very tiny tiny scale, and how we can understand that the speed of expansion on universe is higher than the speed of light ?
even using the powerful telescope we just see the lights from a galaxy not the object itself in real time, also the lights are red shifted as well. So what's the basis of proving univers's expansion rate is higher than of light speed?
