Are rogue planets ever born in isolation?

I'm using the term "rogue planet" here loosely to mean anything of planet-level mass that is not orbiting around a star. Popular discussions of these objects always describe them as forming around a star and then being ejected by gravitational interaction with other planets. But I would have thought that, in principle, they could form in interstellar space just by the collapse of a sufficiently small cloud of dust and gas.
I realize that a small cloud will have less self-gravity, and would therefore take more time to collapse [see the answers for a correction to this assumption] and have a greater chance of being disrupted by other forces. But has a theoretical analysis been done of the minimum mass object that could be expected to form in isolation over the time frame of the current lifetime of the universe? It would be a surprising coincidence of that minimum threshold were the same mass as the mass required for hydrogen fusion.
