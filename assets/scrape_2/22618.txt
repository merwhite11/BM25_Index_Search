Does space not make sound, or can we just not hear it?

This is a question regarding sound waves and space.
I know that sound waves must travel through a medium "air", enter our brains, and then we can decipher what exactly the sound is.
But in space, there is no air, and so does that mean that no sound waves are being produced, or that there are waves, but we cannot hear them because they never reach us
And how can we tell? We cannot "hear" space, so who says its because theres no air, rather then just because "its not being produced in the first place?"
