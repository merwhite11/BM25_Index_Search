Beginner looking for extra eyepieces for telescope

I have a Bushnell Voyager Reflector telescope. It came with 2 eyepieces: k4mm and k20mm. And I am trying to find additional eyepieces to zoom in further on planets and stars, but the bushnell website doesnt offer any. I am unsure if other brands will work with the telescope. Or is my teleacope not powerful enough to look further out.
