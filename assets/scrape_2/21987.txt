Luminosity in polar regions

I tried to find the habitable planets, thus I suppose to calculate the effective temperatures that incident on the planets from their host stars, I used 
$$
T_\mathrm{eff}=\frac{L}{4\pi\sigma_\mathrm{SB}R^2}
$$
but I don't know how to calculate the effective temperatures in polar regions?
