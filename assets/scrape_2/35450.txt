Stars moving in a straight line in Minnesota

I was outside at around 7:50 to 8:09 ish. At I looked up in the sky to see around 20-50 stars or something moving in a straight line at the same speed. I have never seen anything like this ever. And they keep appearing out of nowhere. Felt like I was at a firework show except no explosions and cool lights. Kinda freaky if you ask me
