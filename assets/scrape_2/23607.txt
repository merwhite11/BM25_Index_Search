Telescope selection for concrete uses

Suppose I want to build or buy a telescope for the following uses:

Astrophotography (mainly galaxies and nebulae).
Transits of exoplanets and binary systems like Cygnus X-1.
To search for BH+star systems.
To measure the rotation curve of some spiral galaxies

Is that ALL feasible and/or cheap at amateur/semi-amateur level?
