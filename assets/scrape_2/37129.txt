How do astronomers detect the 'metals' in a star? If the atoms are presumably completely ionized?

Atoms and molecules usually emit their characteristic wavelengths because of the electrons' energy levels....
Do the completely ionized ('naked') nuclei absorb and/or emit EM radiation?
If so, at what type of wavelength?  Mostly visible, IR and UV like the rest of the star?
