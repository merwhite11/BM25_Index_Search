Are apparent magnitudes corrected for extinction at zenith?

For example, according to Google, the apparent magnitude of the sun is $-26.74^m$.
Is this the apparent magnitude viewed through Earth's atmosphere when the object is at zenith?
(Assuming most favorable conditions, sea level, zenith extinction is about $19\%$ or $0.23^m$, at least according to the IAO table of constants)
Might it be an extra-atmospheric value instead, i.e. corrected for any form of extinction?
