Why does it take so long to transmit an image from New Horizons to Earth?

I just got the news that the New Horizons space probe has passed by some remote planet on the edge of the solar system. 
I was surprised that the guy from NASA says that it might take 24 months from us to get the photo of that planet. 
The solar system is not that big, right? It is slow because the signal transmission is slow, right? But why is the transmission so slow?
