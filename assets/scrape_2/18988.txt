Why and how the Moon experiences only slight tidal forces

I understood the literal meaning of the red-underlined sentences, but frankly speaking, I don't know the processes. I mean I want to know how Earth's rotation makes a cycle of two high and two low tides in the above context and why, of course how, the Moon experiences only slight tidal forces. 
And in the second sentence that I underlined in red, the phrase 'as its distance from Earth varies throughout each month' means that the Moon has slowly gotten away from the Earth, I think. Am I right? Honestly, I can not understand the process of the second sentence entirely.
Thank you.
