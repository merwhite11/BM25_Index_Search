Is the Milky Way Visible from Nebraska?

Is the Milky Way Visible from Nebraska?  If so, where is the best place to view it, and also what would be the best time of night to see it?  I know this is probably a very novice question, just trying to get a better understanding of what I can see.  If it helps, I'm south of Omaha.
