Resource Recommendations to systematically develop a foundation via Self study in Astrophysics/Astronomy?

I am a high school senior (Grade 12) with a passion for Astronomy/Astrophysics. I already searched quite a bit here on the other questions on resources, but I couldn't find any that shows a concise, systematic order that one can follow. (I might have also missed it if so I do apologize. If it helps I do have quite a decent handle on AP-level Calculus and decent physics background.
So, I would like a systematic order of books, videos, resources of any kind that I could peruse to achieve a significant foundation (and ambitiously say up to a Graduate level?) in Astronomy/Astrophysics.
Thank You!!!
