Question: Is there any phenomena in a star that could be used to predict its supernova explosion with years or decades of advance notice?
Answers to Are there observable changes in a star about to become supernova, minutes or hours before the explosion? address shorter timescales like hours or days, but I'm looking for times that are orders of magnitude longer than those discussed there.
