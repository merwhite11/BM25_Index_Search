Is it possible for any of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system to have moons?

All of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system are all orbiting very closely and are somewhat large. Would it be possible for at least one of the planets to have a stable moon in orbit around it? Or would the gravitational interactions between the seven planets and the TRAPPIST system's star make it too unstable for any moons? Would it be possible for any planets orbiting red dwarfs closely to have moons?
