Have caged molecules ever been observed in space?

astrosnapper@'s thorough answer to the question What is precipitable water vapor in millimeter-wave radioastronomy and how is it measured? links to the paper Observing Conditions for Submillimeter Astronomy which discusses spectral windows of atmospheric transmission in the 100 ~ 1500 GHz range. These windows are "delineated" or limited by strong absorption lines of molecular water vapor in the atmosphere. 
Figure 2 is shown below. The caption reads

and displays ortho- and para- water separately.
Curious to find out what those were, I went to Martin Chapin's (also here) site Water Structure and Science which discusses the physics of ortho- and para- water, and describes experiments on single water molecules trapped and isolated in C60 fullerene "cages" (Endohedral fullerenes): 

ortho-Water and para-Water

Question: Have caged molecules ever been observed in space?
These could be trapped in fullerenes (which I believe have been observed) or otherwise.
