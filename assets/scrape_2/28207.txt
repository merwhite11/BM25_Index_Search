How is distance in light-years converted to years back in time?

When I look at the Alnitak,the left most star of Orion's belt, it is 736 light years away. How could I convert this distance to an estimate of how long ago what I am seeing happened.
Would it be simply be 736 years ago?
Are there instances of when this isn't as straight forward?
