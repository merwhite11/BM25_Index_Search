How large will our Sun get during the red giant phase (ie which planets will it engulf) before the helium flash?

I have read that our Sun will increase in size to a red giant.  But after it goes through the helium flash it will contract somewhat.  Then after that grow again to be even larger before finally losing its outer layer as a planetary nebula and becoming a white dwarf.  I've seen estimates that the red giant phase will consume Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth.  (Even with Earth's expanded orbit due to the Sun losing mass to the solar wind.)  My question is how large will that first stage be prior to the helium flash?  Which planets, if any, will it engulf?
