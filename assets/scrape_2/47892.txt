Would anything be different on Earth if the rotation of the Moon wasn't synchronous?

The Moon is in synchronous rotation, meaning the same side of the Moon is always pointing towards the Earth. My intuition is that it wouldn't make any difference (other than the fact that the whole surface of the Moon would be visible). But maybe there is something I didn't think of.
