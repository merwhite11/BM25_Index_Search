What does the surface of Mercury look like?

What does the surface of Mercury look like?  What color is it (I have seen some images portraying it grey and some a light brownish color), and would the surface be dusty like the Moon, smooth, or even cracked (e.g. see image below) due to thermal expansion and contraction?
