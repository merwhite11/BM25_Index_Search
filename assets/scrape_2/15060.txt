What would happen if an astronaut orbiting Earth was exposed to radiation?

I know that astronauts are constantly being protected from radiation from the sun and the cosmos. They are normally very safe from the harmful effects of radiation but what if their protection wasn't effective at all? What would be the effects on the human body if it is exposed to radiation?
