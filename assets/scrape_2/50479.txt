Could a super-Jupiter exoplanet in the habitable zone have an axial tilt?

Iâ€™m wondering if a massive planet (maybe 10 times the mass of Jupiter) in the habitable zone of a G type star could have an axial tilt similar to earth or if gravitational forces would erode the tilt the way they do to moons orbiting gas giants?
