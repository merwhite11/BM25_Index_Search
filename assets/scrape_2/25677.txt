When does a star rise with the sun?


Problem: Suppose an observer's latitude is 45 S and a star's RA/DEC is
3h15min/41S. On what date will the sun set with the star.

I have been stuck on this problem for a while.
I found out that the time of setting of a star is found using the formula:

$$\alpha+\arccos(-\tan(\delta).\tan(\phi))$$
$\implies3\frac{1}{4}^h+\arccos(-\tan(-41)\tan(-45)) = \alpha_{sun}+\arccos(-\tan(\delta_{sun})\tan(-45))$
$\implies 47.8 = \alpha_{sun}+arccos(tan(\delta_{sun}))$

I am not able to solve this any further.
Is there something wrong in my approach? Something I am missing?
If not how do I solve the above equation further?
Thanks in anticipation!
