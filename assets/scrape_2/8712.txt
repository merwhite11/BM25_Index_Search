earth is spherical , does it mean the ground on earth is like a ball?

I know earth is spherical in shape.
Does this means earths atmosphere is spherical in shape or the ground/(land+water combined) is in spherical shape.
I have some doubts if the second is true.

since the earth is rotating around itself and  revolving around sun in the same time. When we see sun in the afternoon on top of your head. it can be actually you are upside down looking onto sun which is under you.

I'll add my other doubts once some one answers my question.
