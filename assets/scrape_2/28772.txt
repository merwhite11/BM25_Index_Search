South-eastern sky above the tree line just now, NE Cape Cod, I saw a very bright, twinkling "star"

I live in New England, Cape Cod to be exact. 
I saw a very bright, twinkling object. I watched it for several minutes and it never moved. It was in the east just above the tree line, what might it be?
