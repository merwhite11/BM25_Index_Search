Is there a connection between the solar wind and the cosmic radiation?

Cosmic radiation consists of high-energetic particles, mostly protons, that come amongst others from supernovae and our sun, right?
The solar wind also consists of charged particles, like protons and electrons, and comes, of course, from the sun.
So I wonder whether there is a connection between these two? Is the solar wind a part of the cosmic radiation?
