Nature of faculae on Ceres? Do they glow in the dark?

It looks like the faculae on Ceres glow in the dark, although the scientific community has decided it's brine. [What an imbecile idea, BTW!]
Would it be possible to photograph the dwarf planet and the Occator crater from the dark side?
Now, what would a photo show?  Could this be done with a moderate-sized telescope from earth?
For those who doubt that the faculae glow in the dark I strongly suggest looking at the image below! Or the sequence of images of the Occator crater, further down.
So what should or could be done? Ceres' angular diameter is according to wikipedia 0.33-0.84''. Palomars 200 inch telescope or Keck or Hubble must be able to see something and settle the question, or?
Another thing; how about looking at Ceres and the faculae with a radio telescope using VLBI? With the faculae illuminated by sunlight and in darkness...
Cheers!
