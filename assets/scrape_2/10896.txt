What's in the center of a Galaxy?

Ok, so it's supposed that there is a black hole in the center of any galaxy, that makes my head explode because:

There is light in the center of the galaxy, but it is supposed that black holes, also attract light.
For a black hole to exist there should be a star explosion, so what size does the star needed to be to create such a galaxy.
Why does the black hole doesn't eat us, I mean what objects are pulling us away from the extreme gravity of the black hole.

I'm not god, I didn't study Astronomy, I'm just a kid fascinated by the Universe. (This question should be dumb for anyone who studied Astronomy)
But if you think my question is dumb, (which isn't) or if you have any recommendation for further asking, let me know!
