Would a red dwarf star resemble our own Sun at sunset to an observer on a nearby planet?

Suppose you're observing a red dwarf star at Noon from the surface of an Earth-like planet orbiting in the red dwarf's habitable zone, so that the red dwarf's luminosity is equal to our own Sun.
Aside from the red dwarf's greater perceived size in the sky, would its color and brightness closely resemble our own Sun at sunset in Earth's sky on a clear, dust and smoke-free evening?
Is it fair to say that since the Sun's color and brightness changes as it dips closer to the horizon due to scattering of blue light, there could conceivably be a close color/brightness match to any G, K, or M class star at some point along the Sun's trajectory in the sky?
