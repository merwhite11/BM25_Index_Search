Determining when the sun shines on different sides of a building using astropy

I recently installed motorized solar blinds on various windows in our house to reduce solar gain during the summer months. I have integrated the blinds with my hubitat home automation system, and am writing a python script to control the blinds. I've got lat/lon coordinates for my house, and I've determined that my house faces 145 degrees SE. I'm trying to figure out how to use astropy to determine which side(s) of the house the sun is shining on (if any) at the current time. My house shape is basically square, so the windows are basically either parallel or perpendicular to the direction the house faces.
I've found this example for getting the solar zenith. I'm assuming I need to use something like this example, plus the azimuth, adjusted somehow for the direction my house faces, to figure out which windows are getting sun at a given time, but I'm still working out the math. Thanks in advance for your help.
