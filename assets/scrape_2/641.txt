How exactly is our universe mapped?

Watching this youtube video shows that our planet is nothing more than dust in the wind.
At the 2:50 mark in the video, you will see a view of the whole Milky Way. At the bottom you will see this text 
Light travel time from earth: 100,000 years
Which means if we travel at light speed we need 100,000 years to go far from the Milky Way.
If nothing can travel faster than light, and if it takes 100,000 years to go far from the Milky Way at light speed 
How did they map our whole universe, which has a radius of 13.798Â±0.037 billion light years?
