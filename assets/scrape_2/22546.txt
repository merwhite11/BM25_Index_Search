What specific parts of the Milky Way do we see when we look up?

I know we can't see the center.  But do we see any of the central bulge?  Are we just seeing nearby stars in the Orion Spur where we are?  In the Sagittarius Arm?  In the other direction, are we seeing any of the arms further out from ours?  Where are the dust clouds we see, in relation to these arms?
