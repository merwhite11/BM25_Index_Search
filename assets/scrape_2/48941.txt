It takes light roughly 8 minutes to travel to Earth from the Sun, but based on which perspective?

The passage of time is relative depending on whether one is the stationary observer or the object/particle traveling at the speed of light (or close to it). I get this, kind of. But, when we talk about "it takes light X [units of time] to travel Y [units of distance]", where does time dilation come in? In the case of light's journey from the Sun to Earth, if we imagine the photons doing the actual speed-of-light travelling, is it 8 minutes for "them"? Or is it 8 minutes for us to observe their journey?
Apologies in advance if it's a stupid question.
