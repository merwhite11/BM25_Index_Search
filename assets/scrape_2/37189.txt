Black dot visible when looking into the telescope

A few weeks a go I bought a telescope.
The problem is I am a total beginner. I was able to setup the telescope correctly and I already saw the moon very clearly. Then I moved on to jupiter. When I looked through the telescope a black dot was visible in the middle of Jupiter. I have already turned the focusing wheel but then Jupiter became smaller and smaller and the point became smaller. But even when I turned the eyepiece all the way out the dot was still visible and jupiter was hardly visible.
