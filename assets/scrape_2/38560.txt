What object did I see in the sky?

Tonight, while looking at the night sky, I saw a moving object which I cannot assign to any cosmic or man-made object known to me.
The object looked like a star, and hadn't it been moving, it would have been indistinguishable from one. However, unlike usual objects in the night sky, its movement velocity was inconsistent, and its direction didn't follow a straight line, but kept digressing and then returning to the original path. It reminded me of a biker going through a crowd, or a car avoiding potholes. It moved quite quickly though, and traversed the sky in a couple of minutes.
What object is the description consistent with?
