How does the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) compute the Magnetic Activity Index (MAI)?

I am looking for a description about how this number called Magnetic Activity Index (MAI) is calculated. All I know is that the processing pipeline of the instrument HMI calculates it. But I would like to know how this quantity is defined and computed! I have not yet found anything on google about it, not even an article.
