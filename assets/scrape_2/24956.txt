Is the Milky Way Galaxy predicted to collide with a neighboring galaxy?

Topic
I've read several articles online that state that our galaxy will collide with a neighboring galaxy in the future, but there is no evidence about it happening. 
Question(s)

After reading a few articles on the topic, I started to wonder:


When will it happen?
Which galaxy will collide with our own?
Is it even going to happen?

(your post should answer all three)
It's a scary but oddly interesting theory, and a little enlightenment would be much appreciated! :)
Not a duplicate--
I'm asking if the possibility that any galaxy will collide with our own, not just one.
