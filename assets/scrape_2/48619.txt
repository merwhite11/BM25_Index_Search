Did I see a satellite (or space station)?

In the UK (south east) - when outside this evening at about 19:10 UTC (22nd Feb 2022), looking due south, with Orion directly above me.
There are two bright stars vertical to each other, just to the left and above the "shoulder" of Orion, from looking in a book I believe they are Castor (top) and Pollux (bottom).
I noticed a moving light approaching the top star - very small and faint, no flashing lights so not likely to be a plane. In the space of under a minute, it travelled between the two stars and kept travelling south (then got hidden behind some roofs of other houses).
Is this likely to have been a satellite, or possibly the International Space Station? It's the first time I've noticed anything like this. It appeared to be moving quickly, and didn't leave a trail, so I don't think it was a shooting star/meteorite.
