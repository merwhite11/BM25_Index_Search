Would a future hole in the Cosmic Microwave Background show us the edge of the universe?

If my understanding is correct, the Cosmic Microwave Background always come from our event horizon. By event horizon I mean the edge of the observable universe.
If the universe is finite does it mean that after some time (maybe in billions of years?) there will start being a hole in CMB. As our event horizon let us see CMB from regions further and further away, isn't there a time where it will reach the edge of the universe?
If this is the case, based on the known number of atom and mass of the universe, is it possible to calculate when this will happen?
