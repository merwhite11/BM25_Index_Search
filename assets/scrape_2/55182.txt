Distance of the Crab nebula and the speed of light

I am watching a youtube video that says that, there is plenty of historic records that shows that the star, that turned into the Crab nebula, blew up in 1054. According to the video, it is located 6500 light years away.
The video author gives up calculating when it happen but that should be super easy.
1054 is 969 years ago.
One light year, is the distance light travels in a year.
969 + 6500 = 7469

7469 years ago was in the year 5446 BC. Is that correct, or am I missing something?
EDIT
I wrote year 1057 instead of 1054! Sorry about that and thanks @PM-2ring
