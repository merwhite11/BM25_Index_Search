Position and velocity vectors of nearby stars?

One of my favorite tools for modeling the solar system is the Horizons Ephemeris generator where I can get position and velocity vectors of various bodies. Is there something similar for neighboring stars?
The closest I've come so far is Ashland Studio's 500 nearest stars in the Hipparcos Catalog. It gives distance of each star. Clicking on a star in this list will often give the star's relative velocity wrt our solar system. But it doesn't the direction of it's motion. 
For the time being I'd like the model the stars within about 20 lightyears of Sol.
