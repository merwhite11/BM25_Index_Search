Is Dark Matter possible if there is dynamical friction?

If dark matter existed: wouldn't it slow down the orbital velocity of stars in galactic disks by dynamical friction more than it would accelerate them through additional mass? The original orbital momentum of the galaxy and the effect of its baryonic mass are only one-time effects while the presence of a dark matter halo and its dynamical friction exerted on orbiting stars would be permanent and abrasive.
