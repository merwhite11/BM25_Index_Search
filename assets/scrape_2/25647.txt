How can I find out the maximum magnification of my telescope?

I have a Meade DS-2080AT-LNT. It's an inexpensive scope that I've had for several years. It has a couple of eyepieces with it, but nothing that will let you get a really good look at planets. I doubt I can see any Messier objects as more than a blip.
But it's more than good enough to take up and leave at my family's cabin in the far North and I think all of the kids that visit will enjoy it. But to get more out of the scope I was thinking about getting a Barlow lens. I see lenses of 2x and even 5x for sale. I don't know enough about telescopes to know what "x" of Barlow I should get for this scope.
The specs are as follows:

80mm (3.1") Aperture: Plenty of brightness to reveal planets, clusters,
nebulas and more.
Sturdy Fork Mount: Lightweight and solid aluminum mount and
tripod for stable views.
494 AutoStar® Controller: Automatically locates more than 1400 objects
and points the telescope toward them for you at the push of a button.

and high power viewing with crisp, wide fields of view.
