How can the equation of state for cosmic strings and domain walls be derived?

In this article which nicely explains why it is really the quantity $\rho + 3p$ which is relevant to determine if the expansion of the universe is accelerating or decelerating by making use of the for this question relevant second Friedmann equation
$$
\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}(\rho + 3p)
$$
it is mentioned that for cosmic strings 
$$
p = -\frac{\rho}{3}
$$
which has the effect that they dont contribute to the "non-inertial" expansion of the universe, and for cosmic domain walls we have
$$
p = -\frac{2 \rho}{3} 
$$
which leads to an accelerated expansion of the universe.
Whereas I understand the derivations of such equations of state for radiation, "ordinary" matter, and a constant source of dark energy, I have not yet seen analog calculations for cosmic strings and domain walls.
So how can the equation of states for topological defects such as cosmic strings and cosmic domain walls be derived?
