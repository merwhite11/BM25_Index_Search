Has this image of the Draco Constellation been altered

Have the stars in this photo of the Draco Constellation been magnified so as to help me see the Draco or not?

Also I really like [this image][2] of Orion; if someone knows of a site with a lot of such images that are in a user friendly, easy-to-find format, I would appreciate it.
