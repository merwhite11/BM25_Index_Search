How big is the galactic magnetic field in the solar system and how can we measure it?

The Milky Way has an associated magnetic field. But how big is it influence in the solar system and can we measure it? I mean, when measuring, how can we make the distinction between the field of the sun and that of the Milky Way? It seems reasonable to assume that both are in the same direction. If it adds a constant field to that of the sun how could we tell?
Would two measurements suffice? Say one at a certain distance and the other at twice the distance?
