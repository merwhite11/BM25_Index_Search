When did our neutrino detectors become sensitive enough to detect supernovas in the core of the Milky Way?

When did our neutrino detectors become sensitive enough to be able to detect supernovas occurring in the Core of the Milky Way galaxy?
I know the answer is well before 1987, because we detected the neutrinos from that supernova which was 6-7 times further.
