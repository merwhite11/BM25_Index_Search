How did ancient astronomers know to order the planets from the closest to the farthest from the Sun?

If we assume a geocentric model of the universe (like ancient astronomers did) how could we ever find out (again, like ancient astronomers did) the right distances of the planets? For example, how did they know that Jupiter is
further than Mars, if Jupiter is brighter?
