Does any asteroid we have ever seen have a hot core like earth.?

I was wondering if any of the asteroids we have ever seen has a hot core like Earth's.
I'm thinking that Earth has a strong gravitational field and so formation would have involved a lot of gravitational energy being converted to heat, but not so much for the asteroids.
