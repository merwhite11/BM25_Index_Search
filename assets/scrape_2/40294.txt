How can I work out longitude and latitude through my telescope?

We purchased a Celestron Astromaster 90EQ Refractor Telescope and a Celestron Powerseeker Accessory Kit about four years ago but have not used it much for many reasons. As such my husband and I are complete beginners and was hoping for some advice please?
My Dad passed away during the lockdown and we have had a star named after him.
It's a "UK" based star and we will be sent longitude and latitude co-ordinates enabling us to search for it.
On Christmas day we are hoping to use the telescope, with our children, to point out my Dad/Grandad in the sky. However, my husband has now said he thinks you have to buy an accessory or something to do this and the telescope and accessory pack we have does not have the necessary equipment ?.
Can anyone advise how you can do this please and, if we need to purchase an accessory, recommendations?
Thank you very much for any help in advance.
