Why are the moons of Neptune sorted by diameter?

The five moons closest to Neptune are sorted by increasing size. Naiad < Thalassa < Despina < Galatea < Larissa. The trend continues with Proteus and Triton, only interrupted by Hippocamp, which is smaller than the closer moons.
Is this ordering due to pure chance? Is there a reason why moons closer to Neptune should be smaller? Is it possibly an observational bias?
