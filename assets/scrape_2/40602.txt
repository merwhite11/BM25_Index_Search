How loud was the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs?

Asteroid impacts on the Earth can be very loud when they break up in the atmosphere, like Chelyabinsk, captured in this video:



The Chelyabinsk asteroid break-up was estimated to be about 180dB at 3 miles, and was detected as far as 9000 miles away.
If asteroids don't break up, presumably they are extremely loud on impact as well.  How loud was the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs either on atmospheric entry or impact with the ocean?
