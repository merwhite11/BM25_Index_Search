What magnification is required to see detail on Mars / other local bodies?

I have a 125mm Jones Bird newtonian telescope (very shoddy) with 6x lens (2× + 3×) essentially we were able to see a very small O (yeah that's to scale) with varied shades of red. 
Is Mars far away from earth right now relative to the average distance or is it just my telescope not powerful enough?
If I wanted to seriously have a chance at picking up significant features on Mars or perhaps pickup the rings of saturn or the red spot of jupiter, whats the minimum setup that I am going to need? 

This setup would run me around 3,000 dollars:

Would this be overkill? For $3,000 is this one of the better choices for local planetary observation?
