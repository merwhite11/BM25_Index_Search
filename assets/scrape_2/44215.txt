Will a solidifying core inside a planet affect its appearance?

In this question it is said that Mars once had a liquid core that solidified. If the liquid has a smaller density than the solid, will this affect the outer parts of the planets? For example, if the Earth's inner core (a part of which consists of iron and nickel) would solidify, would this give rise to a higher rotation speed or gargantuan Earthquakes? Would it have been visible on Mars?
