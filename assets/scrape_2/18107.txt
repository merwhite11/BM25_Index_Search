How many judges sat on Galileo's trial over heliocentrism and who were they exactly?

I saw several chronologies of the trial online but most of them only mention the name of Urban 8 as involved in the actual court proceedings. How many judges were involved and who were they exactly?
Note 1. Reading the small print at wiki I found the names of the three of the ten cardinals who did not vote to convict: Francesco Barberini, Laudivio Zacchia and Gaspare Borgia.  I still don't know the names of any cardinals that voted to convict.
Note 2. Material related to the trial can be found in "Hidden agenda of the Galileo trial?" on the History of Science and Mathematics Stack Exchange site.
