Why is moonrise/moonset before sunrise/sunset on some days but after on others?

While looking at the daily forcasts for the week on The Weather Channel app on my phone I noticed that today, Thursday the 18th, both moonrise and moonset are roughly half an hour to an hour BEFORE sunrise and sunset. I also noticed that the day after, Friday the 19th, that moonrise is roughly 15ish minutes before sunrise where as moonset is roughly 30ish minutes AFTER sunset. This weekend, starting Saturday, is when both moonrise and moonset are after sunrise and sunset, with moonrise being just shy of half an hour after sunrise and moonset being about an hour and a half after sunset on Saturday. With Sunday moonrise being just barely an hour after sunrise and moonset being two and a half hours after sunset. Can anyone explain this to me please?
