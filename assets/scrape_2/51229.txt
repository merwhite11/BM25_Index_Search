Why is time not a spatial dimension?

I am a little confused about dimensions.
People say we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension but I don't know how this is possible. How can there be different "types" of dimensions? Maybe we just can't perceive the fourth one properly.
Let's take two-dimensional space for example. Two-dimensional space is composed of many one-dimensional slices.
Three-dimensional space is composed of many two-dimensional slices.
Four-dimensional space, therefore, should be composed of many three-dimensional slices.
Assume that the universe has four spatial dimensions, time being the speed at which objects pass from "one slice" of three-dimensional space to the next. And us being humans, we just can't perceive movement in that fourth dimension. We can only detect when we change discrete positions, i.e in moments.
And time can't go backwards because the universe as a whole has a velocity in one direction in this fourth dimension.
I just want to know how time is a separate thing.
