Can you see the difference with the naked eye whether Venus is at the other side of the Sun or at the Earths' side?

When Venus is at an angle with the Sun from the Earth's perspective we are able to see the reflection of the Sun on Venus. But imagine that Venus is on the farthest half of its orbit around the Sun. In that case the planet is further away but we receive his reflection on a larger plane. So could an eye see the difference whether Venus is further away in his orbit or closer to the Earth?
