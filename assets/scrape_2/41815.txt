Is there a term for "path of the Sun at a given point of the Earth"

I want to buy a house and I'm asking myself what quantity of daylight the various sides of the house receive.
I know the house is roughly oriented in the east-west direction.
But I'd like to know the exact apparent path of the Sun around the house depending on seasons, with (ideally) the elevation angle of the Sun.
Is there a technical term for "the apparent path of the sun at a given point of the Earth, at a given time of the year"?
Also, is there an online tool that allows one to visualize this path on a map?
