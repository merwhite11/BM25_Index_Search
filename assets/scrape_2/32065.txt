Strange lights moving North

My fianc√© and I took our youngest sons out to sky watch at the river near by. The older of the 2 was looking up and said - "look it's Santa's reindeers!" All of us looked up and saw a literal straight line of what looked like hundreds of stars in a straight line, like in a formation, moving due north. They didn't come from the south, it's more like they just appeared and disappeared. Does anyone have any idea what we may have seen?
