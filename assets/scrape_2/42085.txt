How can astronomers pinpoint the location of the source of a neutrino?

In the popular press, in recent months, we have heard a lot about high-energy neutrinos from far outside our solar system reaching our detectors....
But I wonder...
If a single neutrino from a great distance randomly, rarely, smacks a xenon atom in a detector, how the heck can they 'triangulate' it's direction?
