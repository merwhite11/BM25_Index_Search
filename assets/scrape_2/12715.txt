Rings around a smaller, close-in planet?

Is it possible for a small, close-to-star planet to have a stable ring system--icy or otherwise? 
A smaller planet means the rings would have to be closer to the planet, which means the radial shear (difference in orbital speed vs. radius) in the rings would be higher. A higher radial sheer would be more likely to cause turbulence...or so I would think. 
Obviously one would not expect icy rings around a planet that's inside the frost line....
