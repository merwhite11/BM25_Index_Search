Strong Gravitational Lensing Dataset

I'm a Machine Learning Student and I'm working on Strong Lensing Image Classification. this is a hot topic nowadays but strangely after days of searching and communicating with different people I still can't find an accessible Dataset of these objects!
Do you know any place I can find a simple(or not) Dataset containing images, labels and some extended features of Strong Gravitational Lensings?
