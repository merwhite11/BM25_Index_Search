Could an astronomical process create elements in the islands of stability?

I was reading about heavy elements recently, and I took note of the theorized islands of stability, and how some the elements involved are considerably heavier than anything we've been able to synthesize so far. Is there any known astronomical process that could create elements well above the 120-proton mark?
