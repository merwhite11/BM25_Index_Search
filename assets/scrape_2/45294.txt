Lunar Eclipse and relativity

I am currently working on A Depth Study for my year 12 Physics class, and am looking at relativity and time dilation of a lunar eclipse experience on the moon compared to as seen from on Earth. From what I understand there is no atomic clock data from the surface of the moon, and especially none relating to lengths of a lunar eclipse. However, I have decided that the best idea is to find a similar past project that doesn't directly show data for my investigation, but will be able to confirm that there is definently a time dilation. I have already made predictions for the time dilation of the moon over the length of a lunar eclipse seen from Earth using general and special relativity equations. If someone has an idea on how approach this, help would be much appreciated. Thanks.
