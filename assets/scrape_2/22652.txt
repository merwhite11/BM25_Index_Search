Can we, with arbitrary precision, calculate what's the place on earth that's closest to the sun on a given day?

Can we, with arbitrary precision, calculate what's the place on earth that's closest to the sun on a given date? If so, what's the math like? Say, if I wanted to calculate this within 1m, 10cm or 1cm precision, what exactly should I take into account?
