Are gravitational waves emitted equally in all directions?

I have a question regarding gravitational waves that I can't figure out. Hope some wise minds here can help a simple amateur without technical or scientific education.
Two black holes rotating around each other generate and emit gravitational waves. But, in what pattern do they spread?
Do they spread out as an expanding sphere or as a disk? What happens to the direction of propagation as the holes merge into a single hole?
Answers explained in a simple way are appreciated.
