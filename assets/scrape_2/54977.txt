Potentials of space mining

I'm conducting research on the potential benefits of space mining on asteroids, like 16 Psyche. I'm hoping that those who are more knowledgeable than me can help with the following questions:

Are there any signs of companies willing to engage in space mining? If so, are they investing significantly in it? (I only know of a company that is sending out a satellite to investigate.)

If space mining is so profitable, why hasn't anyone pursued it in the past or been actively working to do so?


This is for a senior high school project, by the way.
