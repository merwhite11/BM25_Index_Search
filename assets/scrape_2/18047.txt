Is there a type of star that emits relatively monochromatic visible light?

I was thinking about this question on Worldbuilding and the answers involving monochromatic ambient light, which got me wondering if there were any stars that emitted relative monochromatic light (a "very" narrow band, although I don't have a definition, but something narrow enough to produce the effect in that photo, atmospheric effects notwithstanding).
So my question is: Is there any type of star that emits an extremely narrow band of visible light (not necessarily exclusively visible, non-visible wavelengths can be included) that we have either observed or theorized to exist? "Narrow" as in, on par with a low pressure sodium-vapor lamp.
My Google searches are hindered by a lot of noise, mostly things like monochromatic star patterns, and a few hits regarding non-visible radiation.
