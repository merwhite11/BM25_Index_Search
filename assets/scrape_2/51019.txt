Distance from Earth to Mars at time of November 8, 2022 lunar eclipse maximum

I’m looking for the “exact” distance from the Earth to Mars, at the moment of the lunar eclipse maximum earlier this week (November 8, 2022). As many significant digits as you can muster.
Between the center of the Earth and the center of Mars would be fine, or similar.
Let’s say, at UTC, Nov 8 at 10:59:11.
Extra “points” if you provide information on how to find this distance with the date and time as a parameter.
Thanks.

After taking handheld iphone photos of the November 8, 2022 lunar eclipse from my porch, I was moved to caption one of the images that began to show a touch of the northern lights as the moon dimmed. (resolutions are reduced to allow upload)
