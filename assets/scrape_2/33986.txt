Are there only a set number of atoms in the whole universe?

As per the title, are there only a set number of atoms in the universe? Or does the universe make more atoms, and if so, how does it work?
I'm a high school student that just had a question during science class, I didn't ask my teacher, since he has more knowledge in biology than anything.
