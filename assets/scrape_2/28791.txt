Distance to objects

When we read that, for instance, M31 is 2.54 ± 0.11 Mly (778 ± 33 kpc) away from us, does this distance estimate take into account the travel time of the light we observe? In other words, what is the "timestamp" on the distance estimate? Does it actually reflect how far away M31 is now?
