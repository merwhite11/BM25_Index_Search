What might be the cause of the hot summer on Earth in 2018?

I have a question relating to the hot temperature this summer. There are 3 reasons that I can come up with:

Chemical, greenhouse effect.
Increased solar activity.
Orbital Resonance. The Earth is closer to the Sun, due to gravitational pull from other planets.

Anybody know something about Orbital Resonance? The orbits are affected by one another as they line up? Particularly the larger ones like Jupiter, Neptune and Saturn?
