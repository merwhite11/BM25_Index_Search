Have auroras on Titan been observed yet?

After reading the very insightful introduction to auroras on other planets I started digging and found various questions and some answers here on the same topic, see below.
What I did not figure out yet: Have auroras been observed on the moon Titan?
I am aware that Titan does not have a significant magnetic field, but to my understanding that would only mean that the aurora would occur right at the impact point of solar winds rather than in polar regions, given that the particle flow is enough intense.
