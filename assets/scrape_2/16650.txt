What is the projected range of the JWST to be able to detect exoplanet atmospheres?

Yesterday the K2 mission detected transit events of objects passing in front of a number of M dwarfs which could turn out to be rocky planets. If some of these planets host atmospheres, could the JWST detect IR absorption lines from molecules in these atmospheres?
What would be the expected limiting distance for these stars to allow for such measurements by the JWST?
