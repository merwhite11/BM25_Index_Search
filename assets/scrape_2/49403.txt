Why not build a swarm of space telescopes?

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has not yet started doing science, yet its successor LUVOIR is being discussed already. However I am curious; some countries have invested billions of dollars in developing technologies for JWST. Building a second copy would be many times cheaper - it's just a matter of production now, not a new research.
Why don't we build and launch a swarm of JWSTs and combine their results?
Such a method was used for 'photographing the black hole' - telescopes, set apart by thousands of kilometers, all functioned as a single Earth-sized telescope, providing immense resolution. Imagine what the resolution would be, be those space-telescopes, placed in different Lagrange-points! Wouldn't that be a greater leap of possibilities, than 15-meter mirror of LUVOIR?
PS: I set aside different wavelengths LUVOIR would cover (nothing personal ;)) - same logic can be used to that project as well when it's launched into orbit.
