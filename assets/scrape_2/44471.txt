What does it mean for cold clouds to be in pressure equilibrium with a diffuse hot medium?

I often read about cold objects (namely cold clouds in the Galactic halo or cold filaments accreting into high-redshift galaxies) being in pressure equilibrium with the diffuse hot ambient gas. What does this pressure equilibrium intuitively mean? That the cold object must be sufficiently high density that it cannot be destroyed by the hot medium? Does the hot medium push on an initially under-pressurized cold object and force it to contract until it reaches equal pressure?
But wouldn't you expect hydrodynamical instabilities to destroy such cold objects as they move through the hot medium? For example, since the cold object is denser than the surrounding hot gas, wouldn't that density contrast cause a Rayleigh-Taylor instability and hence cause the cold cloud to sink? And then, since the cold object has some velocity wrt the hot gas, wouldn't Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities shred the cloud? Under what conditions would these hydrodynamical instabilities be prevented so that pressure equilibrium is maintained and the cold object survives?
