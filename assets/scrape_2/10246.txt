Is there a simple, analytical formula for the lunar phase brightness curve?

Brightness of the lunar disk varies as a function of phase angle. This phenomenon is very well established, as is the increase in brightness at low phase angles.
Is there a simple analytical formula that describes this function? It looks like brightness could be modeled as an exponential as a function of phase angle, modulo the opposition surge.
Thanks.
EDIT: I realize that these effects depend on the wavelength of the reflected light. I'm looking for an average curve, though.
