Need help identifying fast moving red dot in the sky

This occurred last night, August 3, 2023 in Boulder, Colorado between 10:00-10:02pm. I was walking my dog and stopped to admire the stars for a minute. I was facing east and saw a red dot move very rapidly from north to south. It came into and out of visibility very quickly, covering a very short span of the sky. It left no trail or wake whatsoever. It was slower than a shooting star, a bit larger too, but much quicker than an airplane.
I am aware the Perseids, Alpha Capricornids, and Delta Aquariids are active right now and mostly visible in my area, but this looked nothing like them in comparison. Would love some further insight into what this object could have been. Thanks!
