Are the human-made devices on Mars searching for existing life?

According to the answers to my other question - Most powerful microscope on Mars?
The microscopes on Mars do not search for life. SHERLOC (Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals) makes chemical analysis of rocks that may provide evidence of ancient life.
And then the question is: are the human-made devices sent to Mars looking for existing life? Or only for evidence of ancient life? If not looking for existing life then why?
