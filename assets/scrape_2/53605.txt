Is it possible to have satellites (natural or not) orbit the same celestial object in different directions ? (clockwise, counterclockwise)

Is it possible to have satellites (natural or not) orbit the same celestial object in different directions, or is the orbital direction dependent on the celestial object's spin?
Also, is the direction of spin of a celestial object dependent on how it orbits a bigger celestial object?
