At what point in history was the idea of planets being spit out by the sun abandoned?

For context, at some point during the 20th century (and maybe earlier as well), the most popular planet formation theory and the one that was taught at (at least some) schools was the theory that the planets were somehow ‘spit out’ by the sun.
I am not very familiar with this theory, and I have only ever heard it from older people (never less than 60) who were taught this during their childhood education.
Obviously in modern day this is not the prevailing planetary formation theory, so my question is, at what point was this idea phased out of public education?
Note: I know this was a process, and so a 10 year range of time or a decade is an acceptable answer, or the date of a seminal finding that begun the process. Also if you personally have more information about this but maybe not a definitive answer, I would still love to hear about it in the comments or an answer (e.g. I don’t even know what this theory was called)
