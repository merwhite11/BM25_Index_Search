Why are only the poles of Mars frozen, despite too cold temperatures on lower latitudes?

Actually the entire red planet is very cold, cold enough for ice and frost to form not only on the poles. Temperature rises above 0 deg Celsius in summer only. Why then are just the poles frozen, and not lower latitudes during most of the Martian year? Is it because most of these areas perhaps aren't within the triple point of water, unlike the poles?
