Is there an O1 or O0 star?

Okay, we've seen the super hot Wolf-Rayet stars, especially WR 102 and 142, and the "slash stars," many of which are early O (O2-4.5/WN). We know the temperatures of these Wolf Rayet stars. So if we know that, what would their spectral types be in the standard Morgan-Keenan spectral classification (i.e. O2V or B0Ia+), and are there known stars with spectral class earlier than O2?
