Why are telescope mirrors made of glass?

Optical telescope mirrors are typically made from endlessly polished glass surfaces that have been aluminised to provide a very smooth surface of reflective aluminium.
But why the need for glass at all? Why can't mirrors be made of pure metal, or of metal deposited onto some other surface?
Is there something special about the glass grinding process that means no other surface can be made as smooth and still have aluminium deposited on the surface?
Or is it to do with the thermal expansive properties of the glass used?
