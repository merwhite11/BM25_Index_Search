Is the gas in a planet forming disk around a star comparable in density to an atmosphere?

If you were standing on a planetesimal in the planet forming disk of a new solar system (or our own, billions of years ago), would you be able to feel "interplanetary wind"?  Would it be physically possible to "fly" from one planetismal to another or change your solar orbit using an airplane, rotorcraft, or balloon instead of a rocket?
(Obviously you'd need a space suit in the first case, and something other than an air breathing engine in the other - perhaps assume the propeller is spun using electricity and/or nuclear power.)
