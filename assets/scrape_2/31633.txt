Frequency of Earth type cores?

I've read many interesting threads concerning the composition of different planet cores in the solar system while trying to see if this question has already been asked. It appears as if Earth is unique regarding magnetic field strength and interior activity for our size compared with our rocky neighbors. 
I was wondering if the general consensus was that most rocky-type planets our size would share the same characteristics (such as magnetic field strength and convection flow) as us? Or if we are the outliers and most extra solar planets similar to us are expected to be more like Mars or Venus?
