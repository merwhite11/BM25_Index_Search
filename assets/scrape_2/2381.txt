Is dust extinction/reddening caused by Rayleigh scattering or some other physics phenomenon (or both)?

I know from Rayleigh scattering that in the atmosphere redder photons are scattered less than bluer photons by the particles that both make up and are floating around in the atmosphere.  This is why the sky is blue and sunsets are red.  My question is, is the physics behind Rayleigh scattering (which, according to wikipedia, is due to the electric polarizability of the molecules) the same physics behind dust extinction? Additionally, is it the only physics in play or is there additional physics that causes the phenomenon?
