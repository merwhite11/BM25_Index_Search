Mars crater nomenclature

The Wikipedia page for planetary nomenclature states that small craters don't follow the same rule as large craters as far . What is the cutoff between small and large craters (as far as naming is concerned), if there is one at all? Is there a crater diameter under which craters are named for Earth towns and over which craters are named for scientists and writers?
