Strong force and metric expansion

If the expansion of the universe (the metric) continues (and perhaps is accelerating), in a very large but finite time the expansion of the metric will clash with the effects of the strong nuclear force. What happens then? Would the energy required halt the expansion and if so what is the slowing effect of the "stretch" on the strong force today - too small to be measured?
Update: Thanks for the answers so far - I hadn't even considered the big rip scenario. I was merely thinking that as the metric expanded the strong force inside baryons would require unlimited resources of energy to be overcome - but I now understand that is wrong however it still looks to me like a potential perpetual motion machine - continually creating matter/anti-matter pairs. Perhaps that should be a separate question though...
