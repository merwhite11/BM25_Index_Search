How do you call it when two celestial bodies come as close to each other as they will in their current orbits?

On Earth, we say Mars is in opposition when it is 180ยบ from the Sun, which also marks the times when Mars and Earth come closest to each other.
Is there a specific name for such proximity events? For example, Saturn and Jupiter come to this maximal proximity every 20 years or so. Is there a name for the event itself, the "approaching" (previous) phase and the "departing" (next) phase?
