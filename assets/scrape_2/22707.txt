Why do stars born in a cluster finally disperse?

In other words, if a group of stars born within the same nebula, e.g. the Pleiades, are initially gravitationally bound - what causes them to finally get separated and proceed individually? Is it the influence of  "external" mass? Or, are they now and we're they always, even at birth, having the escape velocity? (If the latter is true then I think they should not be considered truly bound from the beginning...)
