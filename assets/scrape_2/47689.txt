Have any HCSSs (supermassive black holes with a tight bunch of gravitationally bound stars) ever been detected?

This article from sciencealert states:

Astronomers think these two galactic cores could merge into one larger
black hole, sending huge gravitational waves rippling out across
spacetime. But if there's any asymmetry in the galactic merger, the
newly forged black hole could be punted clean out of the galaxy and
sent zooming across the Universe by gravitational wave recoil, taking
a swarm of stars with it. Such runaway objects, theorised in the late
noughties, are called hypercompact stellar systems (HCSSs) - a
supermassive black hole with a tight bunch of gravitationally bound
stars, careening away into the cosmos.

Have any HCSSs (supermassive black holes with a tight bunch of gravitationally bound stars) been detected since then?
What projects are currently actively searching for HCSSs?
