Why can't we point the centre of the universe from inflation graph we see?


This question is not about whether it makes sense to have a centre of the universe or not instead, it's about the inflation graph we used to see while describing the Big Bang. From the inflation graph (drawn above), it's clear that the universe is supposed to have a centre at somewhere around "The yellow point". Still why do we say that the universe has no centre or universe has it's centre at each point of it.
What's the problem with the figure or my understanding?
