Eclipse comparison: May 20 2012 vs Aug 21 2017 as observed from San Francisco, CA

I'm preparing for the solar eclipse coming in August of this year, and want to make a decision on whether it will be worth my while to travel north from San Francisco.
As observed from San Francisco, when compared to the May 2012 eclipse, will there be more of the sun obscured by the moon in 2017, or less?
