Is there an official list of objects in the sky?

I would like to know how many known quasars there are in the Universe as well as x-ray binary black holes (not Neutron stars) but I don't seem to be able to.
I also want to know how many black holes have been found via gravitational wave detections but I think the answer to this question is 3.
Do you guys know any credible sources that list the objects in the sky via category and gives detailed info of how we found them (x-ray binary or gravitational waves or quasars).
