Why are we building larger land-based telescopes instead of launching larger ones into space?

This question is a follow-up to Do bigger telescopes equal better results?
How much bigger does a ground-based mirror have to be to match what a space-based one can do?  I guess I'm asking primarily for visible light, but I'm interested in general too.
I guess on the ground, you're safe from micrometeorites, so it will probably last longer.  At what point does it become cheaper to build a telescope on the moon or something?
