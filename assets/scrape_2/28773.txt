How did Biden become VP? (naming of 2012 VP113)

The Carnegie Science article Solar System's Edge Redefined describes the discovery of the object 2012 VP113.
Wikipedia's article 2012 VP113 says:

Nickname:
2012 VP113 was abbreviated "VP" and nicknamed "Biden" by the discovery team, after Joe Biden, who at the time of discovery, was Vice President (VP) of the United States.11

and the referenced Nature News item says:

The newfound object's official name is 2012 VP113, but the discovery team calls it VP for short, or just 'Biden' â€” after US Vice-President Joe Biden. In several years time, after observations have pinned down its orbit, the scientists will submit a name for consideration by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the organization in charge of celestial nomenclature.

Question: I understand that VP is short for Vice President, but where do those two letter codes come from? Is the VP in the object's name short for something literal (did the team choose these two letters?), or just a random computer-generated code, or something else?
