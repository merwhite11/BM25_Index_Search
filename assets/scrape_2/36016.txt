What could be the name of a huge asteroid I watched some years ago?

Some years ago I was with my family in Venezuela. I'm not sure about the date/hour, but probably it was somewhat around 2007 in the afternoon. We were talking when one of us saw a huge meteor moving "slowly" from East to West. It was visually about 1/4 of a full moon size. It took a lot to get lost from our view (I'd say more than a minute). We could see the fireball burning and leaving the trail.
I never heard about this in the news and wanted to know if this same event is familiar to somebody else or if you've had a similar experience before.
I mean, this thing was huge and we were just waiting for it to crash but it seems we were lucky. 
Edit:
It wasn't a satellite, since we could see the "rock". It wasn't like these meteors which you cannot distinguish the trace from the fireball.
I'm not sure about the date.
