Safety while using a telescope to view a total solar eclipse

I have an 8-inch reflector telescope and a solar filter that goes on the front aperture to view the Sun (most recently to view the transit of Mercury). If I were to use this telescope during a total solar eclipse, would it be safe to remove the filter during totality? Let's assume I also get the filter back on before totality ends.
