What is the definition of a "pole" of a celestial body?
Earth's pole is defined as it's rotational pole.  The North and South Poles are the two points on Earth where its axis of rotation intersects its surface.
Apparently, (according to everywhere I've read), the poles of astronomical bodies are determined based on their axis of rotation in relation to the celestial poles of the celestial sphere.  But this is an inadequate definition.
What about Pluto?  Pluto's axis of rotation does not intersect its surface.  Pluto is tidally locked with Charon, and Pluto orbits a barycenter that is located outside of Pluto.  And yet Pluto has a North and a South Pole.  Why are the North and South Poles of Pluto where they are, as opposed to any other location on the surface of Pluto?
How are these poles defined for Pluto?
