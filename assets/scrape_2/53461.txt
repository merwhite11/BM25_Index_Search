What is the force that drives electrons along the magnetic filaments of galaxies?

"Milky Way's mysterious filaments have 'older, distant cousins'" https://www.techexplorist.com/milky-ways-mysterious-filaments-older-distant-cousins/54966/?amp=1
Quote from article:
"The seed particles required to form a filament may be provided by the black holeâ€™s jet, but an unknown force must be driving these particles along astounding distances."
Also why do electrons stay together as they move along filaments?
