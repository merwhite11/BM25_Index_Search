What might cause a planet to have a significant tilt in their orbit?

Most of the planets in our solar system all orbit along the same plane, supposedly because of the almost flat dust clouds that formed the planets.
But some planets, such as the one featured below, have a significant tilt in their orbits that separates them from the normal plane of orbit for that star.

What might cause a planet to have such a tilt? Is this the star capturing a wandering body into orbit or is this a phenomena caused by the formation of these systems?
