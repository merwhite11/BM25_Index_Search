How can the universe be flat?

In each video I see on Alan Guth or anyone explaining cosmic inflation and how it solved the flatness problem, it is said that "the repulsive effect of gravity thus change how omega evolves and thus drives it exponentially toward 1", be it an MIT lecture or an interview.
How does changing the way omega evolves drive it to 1? Like where is the math or intuition?
(i know what omega is)
