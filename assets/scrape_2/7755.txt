Does naked eye miss a lot between local stars and distant milkiness?

When I look at the night sky I seem to resolve points which are local stars and milkiness at further regions of the galaxy. But what is between? I think there must be a lot of stars which are too faint to see individually, and yet not perceivable as part of a dense region of stars. Is this at all accurate? Does anybody know how much we fail to see when we think we are looking?
