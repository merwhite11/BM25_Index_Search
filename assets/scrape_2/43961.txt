Are there gas clouds in space so dense that we couldn't see out of them if one where to be inside it?

The images of telescopes capturing gas clouds are quite intriguing to me, which keeps me wondering about visibility inside them.
Are there gas clouds in space so dense that we couldn't see out of them if one were to be inside it?
Or are even the densest ones still sufficiently transparent that we could see stars and constellations from the inside?
I'm not asking about dust clouds which can certainly be quite opaque in visible light.
