Explain to a 4-year old why people below the equator are not tilted or suspended upside down

So I just bought a globe for my extremely inquisitive soon to be 4-year old son. He knows the very basics of the solar system and knows that we live on planet Earth and also knows the concept of gravity.
While i was explaining to him what the illuminated equator line is he asked me How do people stand below this line? (Look at the globe from a 4 year old's eyes and you will wonder the same)
I explained to him that earth is not as small of a sphere as this globe depicts and almost everywhere it will be relatively flat but then he said there are so many places on this globe at the bottom if you live there earth will be above you and gravity will hold you upside down.
How do I explain it to him?
