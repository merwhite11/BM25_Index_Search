Do black holes really exist?

Black holes from my knowledge are created from the collapse of a star’s own gravity crushing itself, Now my question is well two questions, is it really infinitely dense to where space-time can be distorted to the point where it just stops? if so, this would mean objects caught in the event horizon would freeze and time would be stopped how is the black hole itself not effected by it’s own mass wouldn’t it just cease to exist in the first place?
