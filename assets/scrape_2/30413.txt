What is the actual visual characteristics of a black hole?

Is there a safe distance in which a black hole can be observed with the human eye? What is a safe distance?
I have seen many computer simulated and artist renditions, and I am not sure if they depicted the true colors and shape of BH. 
Below I have a few of examples of what may a BH may look like rendered.

How light from the accretion disk maybe refracted by gravitational lensing.

Should these models be mixed to make a more complete rendition of a BH?
