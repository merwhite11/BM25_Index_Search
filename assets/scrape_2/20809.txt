Whats the deal with black holes and "no information from inside the event horizon can leave"?

I don't know if this would fall under the other questions but I have always been confused by this... Information has left the black hole; its mass, rotation, location, and a few other properties. My problem has been that a true singularity should collapse the space around it and become separate from the universe as being able to observe the effects of a singularity breaks the fact that it is a singularity. 
If I see a black hole I can already tell its mass and be effected by the gravity of an object which I can receive no other information from. This would break things too! 
Let's just say I am an all powerful being who can do almost impossible things, but I still have to follow the laws of the universe. I decide to create a gravity observation station in orbit which uses lasers to see very small changes in the black hole. It also has a teleporter of sorts. 
I then enter the black hole and construct another station, this one however uses small black holes and impossibly powerful thrusters and materials to do certain things. Its purpose is to manipulate and sustain a small black hole "orbiting" the inside of the bigger black hole (being sustained, barely, by the station) it then changes the direction this smaller black hole orbits in a kind of binary way. 
I then step into a "teleporter" converted to binary instructions and encoded into these gravitational and rotational information. (Let's just say the station has no lifespan) and this station over a huge amount of time begins to piece together this code, and reconstructs me in the "teleporter" on board. 
Have I just circumvented the event horizon using disclosed information available to me? Why would or wouldn't this work because for what I see being able to describe a black hole violates the properties of the black hole.
