Are intersecting orbits ever stable?

Ok, I'm asking this question because the obvious counterexample is trojans. Trojans typically intersect the orbit of its relative body. Typically, these are stable in the long-term, especially when the planet is massive. However, these never come within a close enough distance to be affected by the gravitational pull of the planet ($\text{MOID}\leq \text{Hill sphere}$). Are such orbits which intersect the orbit of a massive body within the distance of its Hill sphere ever stable? If so, when?
Edit: As @ConnorGarcia said in a comment, moons are another counterexample. To specify, I am talking about objects whose velocity is greater than the escape velocity in the Hill sphere (unbound objects).
