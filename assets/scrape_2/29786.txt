Possible to use tachyons to explore black hole?

I read on a Wikipedia article lately that tachyons are theoretical particles which always travel at or above the speed of light. That means that when one passes us, we see two images, a blue shifted one and a red shifted one. 
Black holes on the other hand have gravity so strong that light gets pulled in. However, I haven't heard that black holes can exert a gravitational pull that can pull and object that is travelling greater than the speed of light.
So now, I am wondering that if it is possible to use/make tachyons and control those tachyons, could we send them into a black hole and use them like a "echolocation" thing, except the sensors would be on the other side of where the tachyons are first produced?
