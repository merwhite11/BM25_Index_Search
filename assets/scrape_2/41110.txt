How does the universe create more universe ( expand ) out of nothing?

By the law of conversation of energy, mass and matter, how does the universe get the energy to expand itself, and also expand faster than light!!
Edit :
my main question is that if the matter, energy and mass in universe is constant how does universe keep creating more of it and why? How can something be generated from nothing if the total energy in the universe can't be destroyed nor created?
