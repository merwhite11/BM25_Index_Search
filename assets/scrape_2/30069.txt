Was NASA's 2007 attempt to see helions during a solar eclipse successful? What instruments were used?

This answer about Sun-grazing comets led me eventually to Wikipedia's Helion (meteoroid), which has a one-sentence long article:

A Helion meteoroid is a meteoroid that arrives from the approximate direction of the Sun. They are thought to originate as debris from sun-grazing comets.

It has one reference 

"Exploding Lunar Eclipse", an article about an attempt to observe Helion meteoroids, Science@NASA, August 27, 2007.

but that link is now dead.

Was NASA's 2007 attempt to see meteoroids coming from a solar eclipse successful? What instruments were used?
Has it been attempted again since?
