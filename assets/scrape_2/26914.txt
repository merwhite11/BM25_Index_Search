Old star vs New star

We know that with the passage of time, hydrogen inside (near or at the core) a star is converted to helium and other heavy elements via fusion. We can then deduce that the old sun contains heavier elements in comparison to the new one. Does that mean that the mass of the old sun is more than the new sun?
