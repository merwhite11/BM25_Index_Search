How fast would Earth need to rotate to fling someone off due to centrifugal force?

If Earth started spinning fast enough, would the centrifugal force eventually overcome Earth's gravity enough enough to fling someone (let's assume 75 kg) into orbit or into space? If so, how fast would it need to spin?
Being that I'm not a scientist, I'm hoping for a simple answer like, "one rotation per xx hours/mins/seconds needed to throw someone off Earth" or something to that effect. Complicated equations and/or jargon is fine for the sciencey types, of course. I just probably won't understand it too much.
