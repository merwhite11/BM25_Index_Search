Accurate formula for calculating the mass of an exoplanet using the transit method

A friend and I did some work on exoplanets with the help of a research institute (IEEC in Spain) for a major high school project. What we did was to "redetect" the exoplanet XO-6b through the transit method. This is the scientific paper of the official discovery https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02776.pdf . With the data and information provided we could only extract the flux-time curve and with it calculate the radius of the planet. Once the radius was calculated, we wanted to go further and know more characteristics of the planet such as mass, period, distance to its star... What happened is that we needed the mass and we discovered that the most natural way to calculate it was through the method of radial velocities to which we did not have access. What we decided to do was to look in books and we found the following formula that approximated the mass of the planet:
$$M_P = \left(\frac{R_P}{R_\oplus}\right)^{2.06}M_\oplus$$
$$M_P = \left(\frac{162549\cdot10^3}{6370\cdot10^3}\right)^{2.06} \cdot 5,972\cdot10^{24}$$
$$M_P = 4,230\cdot10^{27} kg$$
$$M_P(M_J) = \frac{4,230\cdot10^{27}}{1,89\cdot10^{27}} = 2,48M_J$$
The problem with this formula is that it is imprecise and the result is not satisfactory as it is not within the range of the official finding which is M XO-6b = 1.9 Â±0.5 MJ. Our result was 2.48 MJ (Masses of jupiter). Considering that our radius calculation already deviated a bit from the official one it is not a bad approximation but I would like to know if there is a more correct way to calculate the mass just knowing the radius and having the flux-time curve. With the mass we wanted to calculate other variables like the orbital period or the semi-major axis but the results deviated a lot.
