How does one use SPICE to calculate sunrise and sunset?

I've seen it mentioned here that SPICE can be used to calculate sunrise and sunset. How?
According to the official documentation, SPICE is used to calculate:

Time system conversions
Positions of spacecraft and natural bodies
Orientation of spacecraft and instruments
Reference frame transformations
Illumination angles

I know sunrise and sunset can be calculated from the Sun's coordinates and the sunrise equation.
I was wondering if SPICE had a specific algorithm for this purpose?
