Tidally locked Venus, is it possible and consequences?

Suppose, Venus becomes tidally locked. Will its dark side cool enough so that the CO2 from the atmosphere to precipitate in liquid form to make an ocean?
Also, I wonder, how close Venus is to becoming tidally locked? Does it accelerate or slow down its rotation?
