What is this drawing about in "kitab al bulhan"?

Kitab al bulhan or "book of surprises" is medieval Persian manuscript written in Arabic.
According to Wikipedia:

The contents include subjects on astronomy, astrology and geomancy, including a section of full-page illustrations, with plates dedicated to the discourse topic, e.g. a folktale, a sign of the zodiac, a prophet, etc.

It has following illustration in one of its pages (archive.org page 243). It is the only drawing in the book that has geometrical figures in it. (edit: i was wrong - there are actually many tables and diagrams)
Do you have any idea what it is about and is it related to astronomy?
Is it some kind of calendar?

Google text translation works some of the words:

So it looks like there are "north" and "south" and some names of star constellations, stars etc. Maybe zodiac stars/constellations? It may be related to astronomy or astrology.
