Advice on first Telescope (refractor vs reflector), Barlow lens

I am planning on buying my first telescope. I am getting an 80mm refractor and a 114mm reflector for the same price range. Which would be a better option? Further, would a Barlow lens solve the chromatic aberration issues with a f/5 refractor?
