Are there some (simple) mathematical models which can simulate the cellular/web structure of the universe?

To visualize the structure of a solar system we have some simple mathematical model: Planets orbiting around a Star in circular motion. 
If we want to be more precise the circle becomes a ellipse, the center of motion shifted slightly to the planet and so on.
Q: Is there also a (simple) mathematical model to visualize the cellular/web structure of the universe?
It doesn't need to be very precise. It could be as simple as the model for solar system using circular motion. 2D is fine too.
Here some picture what I'm looking for:
(It doesn't need to be that precise, just look similar too this)

(picture from wikipedia, could not find how they made it)
In best case the mathematical model uses a 2D/3D field (array) of initialization values for generation.
Edit: It won't need to represent every step from big bang to now. The current state is sufficient.
