Does Light Year is their past?

I just wanted to know if what we can only see out-side of our planet is just the past of other objects?
If 1 Light Year is equals to 365.25 Days, then I saw an object outside our planet that is 1 Light Year away from us, does it means I just saw its past 365.25 days ago?
