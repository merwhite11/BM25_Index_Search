How did the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy separate before they began their collision course?

How did the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy separate before they began their collision course?
I understand that gravity is pulling together the two galaxies, but what separated them in the first place while gravity is pulling them together?
Thank you for your consideration.
