Is there an orbit around the earth that experiences a total solar eclipse by the Moon at least every month?

Is there a way to design an earth orbit so that it passes through the Moon's umbra with greater frequency than total solar eclipses occur on earth's surface?
What is the maximum frequency of eclipses that can result? I am not asking about the trivial case of a lunar orbit that obviously experiences the moon's full shadow every orbit.
