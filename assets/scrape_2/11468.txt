Why is the Earthian atmosphere so thin?

Venus is somewhat lighter then Earth, yet has a much thicker atmosphere. One would imagine that the following should be true:

During the formation phase, all inner planets had captured as much gas as they could hold per gravitational/thermodynamic equilibrium. After all, even puny Mars managed to capture a sizable atmosphere.
The rate of atmospheric escape should be much higher for Venus:


Venus receives more heat from the sun, thus higher Jeans escape rate
Venus has negligible magnetic field, so some of its atmosphere must be lost to direct "blow-off" by solar wind


Yet, it is Earth that seemingly misses a great deal of atmospheric volume. So the question is: what are the current theories regarding the "thinning" of the Earthian atmosphere? When and why the atmospheric gases had left the planet?
