more than 30 moving stars

I am Abdul Kadhir from Kochi, Kerala, India. I, my wife and my daughter have seen today (2020-01-11) morning 5.45 AM IST a line of stars. A pair of more than 30 stars moving in a line from south to north. In between one pair stars, there was a little distance and in between 2 pair the distance is 3 times. Roughly so: * *      * *     * *.
It was a wonderful experience. Single stars of about 20 came with in the same line with a little time gap... I want to ask, is this normally happening in the sky, or what is going on?
Every morning, when I wake up, I will look up the sky and after watching.
