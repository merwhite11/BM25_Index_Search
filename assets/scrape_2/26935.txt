Do other supercluster like Laniakea also get pulled by the Great Attractor?

I'm not sure, whether there is any other observable super cluster like our local one, Laniakea, and if they do exists, do they also get pulled by the Great Attractor? 
I am a little confused about superclusters and The Great Attractor, how they do exists relative to each other and how we can see/know from our galaxy, specifically from the Earth.
