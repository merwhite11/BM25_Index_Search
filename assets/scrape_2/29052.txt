What soviet telescope is this?

A friend has a vintage telescope with a broken lens, I asked him to send me its catalog so I can see if I can buy him a new one, he gave me what looks like a Russian catalog, it seems a soviet telescope, I can't read it, I hope you could tell me what it is. I want to search for its lens using English characters.
