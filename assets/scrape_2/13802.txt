Is the flat curvature of the universe in the 5th dimension?

It is hard to imagine that the universe could have a flat curvature while I've read that it is at this moment the most likely.
When you look around the universe is expanding in all directions, so it looks like a spherical ball shaped universe. Nevertheless the curvature is until now measured flat. 
But how to understand that something that has in all directions galaxies look flat. So I thought perhaps they mean that is in the 5th dimension, in analogy with an ant who can't see that the line he is walking on is actually 3 dimensions.
But I read that If the true value of the cosmological curvature parameter is larger than $10^{âˆ’3}$ we will be able to distinguish between the three models (spherical, hyperbolic and flat) even now. So I think how is something in the 5th dimension measured as it is beyond our capability of experiencing?
So somewhere I miss something but what?
