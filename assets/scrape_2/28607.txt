How strong are the stellar flares on YZ Ceti?

Doing research for a game and trying to understand the implications of the stellar flares from YZ Ceti. In short (ignoring the planets for now), if people were to build large space stations of various types (O'Neil cylinders, hollowed out asteroids, etc.), do the YZ Ceti flares pose a significant danger to them? If so, what would be the frequency and scale of such danger?
Better still, what reliable sources can I consult and how would I interpret them so I can figure this out on my own? I'm getting tired of searching and finding the Kerbal Space Program forums.
