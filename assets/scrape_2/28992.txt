Would one have to be more than halfway to the Oort Cloud for the Sun to appear as bright as the full moon?

Is this correct?  If the Sun is 400,000 times brighter than the full moon am I correct in figuring that one would have to be about 632AU from the Sun for it to appear as bright as the full moon.  If the Oort Cloud begins about 1000AU from the Sun, one would have to be more than 60% the way to the Oort Cloud for the Sun to appear as bright as the full moon.
