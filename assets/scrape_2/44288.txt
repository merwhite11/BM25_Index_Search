Are virtual particles the dark energy that curves spacetime negatively?

Dark energy is said to be the cause of the accelerated expansion that all galaxies in the universe seem to have wrt each other. This is said to be caused by an accelerated expansion of space itself, but it can also be viewed as an accelerated motion in negatively curved spacetime. In the beginning of the universe, when only virtual particle pairs were present, spacetime was negatively curved. And not a bit. The virtual particles were accelerating away from each other up to the point where they became real. The matter that formed gave spacetime a positive curvature.
So could it be that negative curvature (which makes particles move away from each other) is simply caused by virtual particles, that is could dark energy just be all the virtual particle stuff that's present in spacetime (which would make it an infaton field effectively)?
