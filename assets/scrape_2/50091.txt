Resources for image representations of planetary systems that indicate the temperature of each part of the system

I was wondering whether anyone knows a resource where I can get images in the form of illustrations or representations of planetary systems, where these images indicate or convey the temperature of each part of the system?  (e.g. thermographs)
If not, Is there any resource where I can get images of planetary systems overall?
Thanks in advance!
