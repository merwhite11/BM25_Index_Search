Questions about spiral galaxy arms

I have 2 questions related to spiral galaxies.
Firstly, how did the arms form? Why would the stars accumulate into those specific areas? And secondly, why are they still intact?
The inner parts of the arms must be revolving more rapidly than the outer parts, so surely the would become stretched and then no longer resemble arms, but simply a disk around the galactic center.
