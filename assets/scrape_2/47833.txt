Is the high-low tide difference greater, on average, at new moon, full moon, or neither?

The difference between high tide and low tide peaks when the moon is full and also when the moon is new. At both of these points in the lunar cycle, the tides are known as "spring" tides.
On average, is the difference between high tide and low tide greater at new moon or at full moon, or is it about the same at one as it is at the other?
