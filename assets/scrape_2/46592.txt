Does the transition between total convection and partial convection cause a significant decrease in lifespan?

A star with less than a certain mass M, which is somewhere between 0.5 and 0.35 solar masses, is fully convective, the hydrogen in the core is constantly being replenished, so it takes much longer for the star to run out of fuel. A star with more than mass M has a radiative center, meaning the core can no longer be replenished. Does this cause a sudden and drastic decrease in the star's lifespan?
