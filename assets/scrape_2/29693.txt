What do the months and hours mean in Tomas Filsinger's Map of The Universe

I have had one of these in my room for decades:

I don't have the booklet that seems to usually come with it, can someone explain to me what the months (with days below it) and hours mean? I imagine it has to do with the position of the earth and therefore the part of the universe that is possibly observable, but I get confused when I try to get the months in the equation.
Thank you very much
