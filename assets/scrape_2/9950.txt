Could a magnetars magnetic field have saved Mars atmosphere?

Just wondering: if a magnetar was close enough to Mars would it have saved its atmosphere by protecting it from solar radiation? I was wondering this because Earth protects us via a magnetic field; the magnetar would be providing Mars one. This is if it did not destroy the planet first as suggested here.
Edit
I meant if the magnetar was safe to live by.
