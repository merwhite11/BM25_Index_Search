How does science knows what is the early universe?

I've read about Hubble seeing the brightest quasar in the early universe. Question is, how does science knows what is early and what is late?
Please correct me if I'm wondering, but after the big bang, everything went in all directions equally. How do we know what direction is the center of the big bang? And continuing on the line of thought, is "early universe" considered closer to the origin of the big bang or further away?
