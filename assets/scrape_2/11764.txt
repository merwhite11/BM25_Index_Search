What does the orbit of multiple star systems look like?

How can I find simulations of trinary, 4-nary.. etc. star systems?
What do they look like?
For example the Alpha Centauri system has 3 stars and possible planets. What does that orbit look like?
I cannot find any simulation on here, it includes 2 Centauri A and B does not include the third dwarf star Proxima.
We have been observing the system for many years, I would think a lot of simulations would come out of each new star system we find, or are they all very similar to one another.
