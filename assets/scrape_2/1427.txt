Did time pass more slowly in the past?

13 billion years ago, the universe was about 600 million years old according to many scientists. At that time, all matter in the universe would have to be closer, or in other words denser. 
Did time pass more slowly, at that time, relative to now? I ask, because increased gravity causes time to pass more slowly.
If we'd been there, and measured the speed of light as we measure it today, would the speed of light be different?
Finally, does distant stars look magnified, given that a "tiny" universe is stretched on our entire sky?
I assume then that we'd measure time based on caesium 133 and distance not as a function of the speed of light, but as a theoretical physical "device" that would be the same physical length then and now.
