Stellar parallax

I am doing a project on "how astronomers measure distance" where i came about with stellar parallax.
i realized how it  works with trigonometry but i am having a slight doubt
tan p=distance between sun and earth/distance between sun and star
where i can find out distance between two star.
but why do we have to wait for six months?
we can measure the distance simply staying in june
why do we need to go to december again??
we can only work with triangle ACD
