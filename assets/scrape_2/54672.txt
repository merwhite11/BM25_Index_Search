Why do planets just look like a dark ball in my telescope

I bought a Matsukov Cassegrain many years ago and now wanted to dust it off and use it. I had two young kids at the time so couldn't really find the time.  Last night Jupiter and Saturn were both visible.  But both just looked like dark featureless balls when I finally found them.  I am sure I had them in sight because they moved out of the field as would be expected, but they looked almost like their shadows i.e. not bright and certainly no colours.
What am I doing wrong? used a 10mm and 25 mm eyepiece.
Does this mean my telescope is actually not working?
