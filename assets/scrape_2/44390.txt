How did the measured diameter of Ceres evolve over time?

Based on the Wikipedia page of Ceres, Herschel measured a diameter of 260 kilometers for Ceres, and Schr√∂ter measured 2613 kilometers.
I do remember seeing at least a half-dozen estimates of the diameter of Ceres that were made over time, but I can't seem to put my hands on the source again. Which astronomers attempted to measure the diameter of Ceres, and what values did they find?
