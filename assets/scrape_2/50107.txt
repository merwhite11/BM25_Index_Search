Why do the Sun and gas planets rotate faster at equator than at poles?

From this site, it states that:

The Sun spins faster at its equator than at its poles.

I have also read somewhere that the gas giants (gaseous planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) also rotate faster at the equator than at the poles. Why this is so?
Editor: this is specifically about difference in angular rates, not linear speed.
