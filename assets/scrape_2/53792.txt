Did liquid helium help the solar system to form by cooling the nebula that collapsed to form it?

Was the gas cloud that collapsed to form the solar system cooled by liquid helium at some point in time? I ask because the Cosmic microwave background had a temperature around 3K when the solar system formed and helium is a liquid at around this temperature and if the pressure is 1 atmosphere and it absorbs heat well
