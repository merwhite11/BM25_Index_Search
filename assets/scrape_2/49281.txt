How much mass does the Sun gain from the Poynting-Robertson effect?

I understand that the Poyntingâ€“Robertson effect describes solar radiation induced drag on certain sized dust particles causes them to lose orbital angular momentum and eventually fall into the Sun.
But how much mass per year is actually added to the Sun from effect?
