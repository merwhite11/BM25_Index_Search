How tall are the pillars of creation? (angular and physical) How bright are they?

NASA's October 19, 2022 NASA’s Webb Takes Star-Filled Portrait of Pillars of Creation shows a sparkly and beautiful infrared image of the Astronomical elephant trunks known as the Pillars of Creation.
The Wikipedia article doesn't seem to give any amateur observing-relevant information like angular size or visual magnitude, nor their actual physical size.
Question: How tall are the pillars of creation in angular and physical dimension? How bright are they?
I wonder if they can at least be spotted as a faint fuzzy spot in an amateur telescope?

NASA's Hubble Space Telescope made the Pillars of Creation famous with its first image in 1995, but revisited the scene in 2014 to reveal a sharper, wider view in visible light, shown above at left. A new, near-infrared-light view from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, at right, helps us peer through more of the dust in this star-forming region. The thick, dusty brown pillars are no longer as opaque and many more red stars that are still forming come into view.
