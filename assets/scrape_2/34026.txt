Binocular highlights from Tasmania next few weeks?

My friends are visiting southern Australia and Tasmania for the next few weeks.
I am lobbying them to bring my Nikon 8x42 binoculars so they can appreciate the Milky Way and possibly see a few other things.
What I need is:

What parts of the Milky way will be most spectacular in binoculars at night at about 40Â° South latitude around this time of year?
Anything else? I've never stargazed in the Southern hemisphere so I have no idea what to point them towards.

I can use online star maps (e.g. in-the-sky.org) so I can give them directions how to find things if it's not hard, but I don't have any idea what "things" there are.
