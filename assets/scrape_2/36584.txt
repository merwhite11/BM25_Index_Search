How poor was our tally of objects that could produce potential extinction-level events back in 1998?

A negative comment below my SciFi SE question Why did the Armageddon (1998) plot require a “rogue comet that jarred loose a Texas-sized asteroid”? says:

I don't understand the question. They needed an asteroid to hit the earth and they needed a reason for NASA to have plausibly not seen it, hence they knocked it out of its normal orbit with something.

to which I replied:

@Valorum This is 1998! That NASA might not have "seen it" is completely plausible. One of the side effects of this film was to help get NASA and ESA to step up their game and start searching for objects that may one day intercept Earth.

While a lot of asteroids were known in 1998, certainly there has been some additional effort to look at near Earth asteroids in the last few decades using existing telescopes, not to mention efforts to pu new ones in space for this purpose.
Question: How poor was our tally of objects that could produce potential extinction-level events back in 1998? Could there have been one that NASA didn't "see" at that time?
