When could solar eclipse happen in a way that Sun's disk is diminishing from below?

I'm trying to solve this task:

During a solar eclipse, an observer noticed that the diminishment of the Sun's disk began directly from below. Where and when could this be?

Concerning "where" question I think it could occur at the equator or somewhere near because only there an observer could see the stars moving "vertically":

However I have a problem understanding when that could happen. Could somebody help please?
