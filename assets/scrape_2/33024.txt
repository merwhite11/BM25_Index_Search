Textbook advice

I'm looking for resources/texts to learn more about stars and things. I stopped studying physics when I was 15, so I'm pretty uninformed. However, I do have a pretty good maths background (UG courses in Calculus, LA and Grad courses in Analysis, Probability Theory and Optimisation). I'd like a book that's rigorous but that doesn't rely on me knowing anything about physics. Possible? 
Best,
S
