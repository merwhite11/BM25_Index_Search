How do a planet's moons and a planet's rings interact?

I am making a video game which features a planet and its moon. And I thought I would add rings too.
But that got me wondering... how do a planet's moon and a planet's ring influence each other?
Does a moon clear out all the debris in its orbit? In other words: does it make a gap in the ring? If so, how large is the gap in relation to the moon's radius?
If not, does the moon travel along as all the other matter in the ring? Would it not make the debris fall to the moon, thereby growing the moon?
Lastly, are both the rings and moons typically in the same plane?
