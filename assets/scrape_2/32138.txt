What are the most popular galaxies for which we have images?

The only galaxies I can think of (not being an astronomer) are Andromeda and Milky Way. There are 51 near galaxies, but they all pretty much say "satellite of Milky way" or "satellite of Andromeda". There are 100k+ galaxies in the local supercluster, and that page seems to have a better list:

Corvus    
Coma Berenices
Ursa Major    
Virgo 
Sculptor  
etc.

If you had to rank them in order of prominence in the scientific community or in popular science, wondering what the top 10 or 20 galaxies would be (for which we have photos).
I am trying to come up with a list of images for educational purposes that are potentially somewhat familiar to laymen audiences, or which would be useful to introduce to laymen audiences.
