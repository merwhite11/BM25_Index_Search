Which star / galaxy is moving away from us the fastest?

I know that we have measured the rate a lot of stars and galaxies move away from us using the doppler shift, and I know that the further a star / galaxy is the faster they accelerate away from us due to space inflation. I'm wondering, did anyone categorise which star / galaxy is moving towards us / away from us the fastest? How fast are they going in relation to our solar system?
