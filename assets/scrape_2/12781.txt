What types of meteorites can I use for making a wedding ring?

I want to buy some meteorite and put stones made from it into gold or platinum ring. Or maybe I can use some metal meteorite for making ring? What kinds of meteorites can I use? It must be strong, non radioactive, it will be good if it pretty look. What minerals do fit?
