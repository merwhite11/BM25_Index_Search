constant semi-major axes of the planets

in Numerical Expressions for Precession Formulae And Mean Elements for the Moon And the Planets (Simon et al., 1994), the orbital elements of the planets are given for long time durations.
The semi-major axes of Mercury, Venus, and Earth are given as constant, whereas the ones of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are given with time-dependent terms. Why is that so?
In detail: for Mercury is given $a = 0.387 098 309 8$ AU, yet for Mars $a = (1.523 679 341 9 + 3\cdot 10^{-10}t)$ AU. $t$ is measured in millenia of Julian years.
