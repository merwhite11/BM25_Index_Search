Could a close passing star be captured by the Sun's gravity?

Earlier I read an article here stating that a binary pair of stars passed within 0.8 light years from the sun. That made we wonder why the stars weren't captured by the Sun's gravity since the sun's gravitational influence spans over 1 light year.
Could a passing star be captured by the Sun's gravity? if so how close would it have to be before it was captured?
