What defines a stable orbit?

While looking for a way to prolong an orbit via moon power I was faced with the parameters of what would be a stable orbit by length of time an object stayed in orbit, What is the definition of a stable orbit? Is there a such an orbit since all orbits eventually degrade?
Can the moon's gravity provide enough force to keep an object in Earth's orbit?
