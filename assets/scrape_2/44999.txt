Vacuum and air wavelengths in spectroscopy

In the SDSS page https://classic.sdss.org/dr7/products/spectra/vacwavelength.html, it is written

Because the SDSS observes many quasars at rest-frame ultraviolet
wavelengths, the data are stored in vacuum wavelengths.

Does UV wavelength have something to do with storing data in vacuum wavelengths?
Also, when looking for emission lines in the spectrum of extragalactic objects, such as supernovae, when should we use vacuum wavelength as the central wavelength of the line
and when the air wavelength?
