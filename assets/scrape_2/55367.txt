Does dark matter exist because as Einstein said the laws of physics should be the same inside and outside a black hole?

Spacetime is said to be time like inside a black hole ( two events can happen at the same place at different times). Spacetime is called space- like outside a black hole ( two events can happen simultaneously at different places outside the hole.
Albert Einstein didn't think the laws of physics should change like this. I am asking : could dark matter be created by a collapsing star so that neutrons don't speed up too much as they fall into the hole because the energy they should have gained from gravity is used to create dark matter .This could mean that because neutrons haven't sped up that for them gravity doesn't get stronger and spacetime remains space like as Einstein would have wanted. Is there anything obviously wrong with this idea - are there experimental observations that could rule it out?
