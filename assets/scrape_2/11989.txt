How is the Lithium Depletion Boundary used to determine the age of a stellar cluster?

According to my understanding of Soderblom et al. (2014), lithium ages of stars are determined as follows:

Determine lithium abundance from equivalent width measurement of Li$_{\mathrm{I}}$ transitions at 6708 angstroms for all stars in a coeval group.
Plot all stars in group on color-magnitude diagram, with each star labeled as Li-rich or Li-poor.
On plot, look for the boundary where the stellar population transitions from depleted to undepleted. That is the Lithium Depletion Boundary (LDB).
Use the luminosity of the LDB and the age-LDB luminosity relationship to determine the age of the stars in the group.

What is the age-LDB luminosity relationship, and what are its physical origins?
