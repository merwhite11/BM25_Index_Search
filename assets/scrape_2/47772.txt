At what rate does the right ascension and declination of a planet, the sun and moon change per hour?

I'm currently building a web app and am getting the RA's and Dec's of solar system objects based on date and time chosen by the user.  Then using the gmst for 0 hours of the date, the app calculates rise and set time of the body. Now when observers time changes the rise and set time also changes which should not be. I'm looking for a way to get the rate of change of RA and Dec of these bodies so that I can always use RA and Dec of a specific time (say 0 hours).
