How to obtain Magellan 6.5m telescope data?

I research about Bullet cluster.
Because Clowe et al. (2006) used Magellan's IMACS data, So I entered the SAO Magellan data archive site.
But I could not find the method to obtain the data.
Is there no method except for sending e-mail to SAO manager?
Is there no site like MAST?
