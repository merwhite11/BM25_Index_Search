Isn't it absurdly unlikely that our Moon would constantly be "facing" us?

I never thought about this until recently, but our Moon is constantly rotating in such a way that it happens to perfectly be "looking at us" at all times. That sounds incredibly unlikely to me.
Couldn't we just as well have had a moon which constantly shifts patterns by rotating in a different manner, rather than us always seeing the same craters on the "moon's front side"?
I can very much understand that this mislead people "in olden times" to assume that this universe is constructed in a very different way from what it actually is. If the moon had been "shifting in pattern" from day to day, or even hour to hour, or even minute to minute, it would be much easier to conclude that it's a spinning orb far away, orbiting our orb. Or at least that's what it feels like to me.
The fact that the moon is always "looking at" us seems highly unlikely. It's rotating around us, but also rotating itself in exactly such a way that it appears to be "fixed" from our surface as we look at it. It's very strange to me.
How did we end up with such a moon? Wouldn't the far, far more likely case be a "spinning" moon rather than "fixed" one? Maybe the moon would orbit us but not rotate at all? (I'm unsure what that would look like from here.)
Or is there something I'm missing here?
