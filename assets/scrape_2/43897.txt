Why is the magnetic axis of Uranus and Neptune off center?



It(Uranus) rotates on its side, tilted almost 98 degrees from the plane of its
orbit around the sun. The axis of its magnetic field is tilted too, at
a 59-degree angle from the rotational axis. The magnetic field is also
off-center, with the field lines emerging about a third of the way
toward the south pole. (source)


Neptune's magnetic field is tilted 47 from the planet's rotation axis
and is offset at least 0.55 radii, about 8,500 mi (13,500 km) from the
physical center. The dynamo electric currents produced within the
planet, therefore, must be relatively closer to the surface than for
Earth, Jupiter, or Saturn. Because of its unusual orientation, and the
tilt of the planet's rotation axis, Neptune's magnetic field goes
through dramatic changes as the planet rotates in the solar wind. (source)

So, it is well established that the magnetic axis of Uranus and Neptune is off-center and due to this, the planets faces the following consequences:

the magnetosphere  is irregular
the strength of magnetic field varies, almost opening and closing periodically as the magnetic field lines disconnect and reconnect
the orientation of magnetic field changes constantly.

But, why is the magnetic axis off-center in the first place? I found no source answering that. Is it due to alignment/orbit/internal heating mechanism of the planets?
