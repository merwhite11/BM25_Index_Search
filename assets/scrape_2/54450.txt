If the universe were infinite, how would it look through a telescope?

I assume there is some limit to how far our telescopes could actually see, and that this distance would be about the same in all directions. So, as a layman, I would assume that an infinite universe would appear spherical, with the telescope appearing to be at the center.
Is this assumption incorrect, and if so, what would an infinite universe look like through a large telescope such as James Webb?
edit: also assume the universe is infinite AND filled with matter similar to what we see locally (galaxys,filaments,etc)
