What would a gas giant consisting of only earths atmosphere look like?

Putting aside how such a planet could be formed and just lets assume it exists.
What would an gas giant "look" like if it just consisted of the gas compound earths atmosphere consists of.
Could we just watch through it?
Would we see a burning core and therefore see something like a dim star?
Or would there be still causes that would block vision, even if there were no other components included?
And would such a planet be able to hold it self together?
