Matter and Antimatter Interaction in the early Universe

Well it is said that during the Big Bang, things were created in pairs: one matter and one anti-matter. I think its a part of the Big-Bang Theory.
It is also said that matter + anti-matter - Energy
Then shouldn't it be so that there would have been no matter or antimatter in existence now since all of them should have reacted to form pure Energy. I mean how were we created then?
And also where are all the antimatter gone now? Are they still reacting with us?
Thanks
