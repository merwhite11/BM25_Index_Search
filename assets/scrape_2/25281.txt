Life in sufficiently hot rogue planets

The Milky Way has a bright center we can't see directly because of space dust. Are there's regions of the galaxy free of that dust that could receive all that light and radiation, right? Would it be possible to exist an 'ecosphere' around the galaxy's center where planets receive as much energy from it as the Earth receive from the Sun? Would it be possible to rogue planets orbiting the galaxy's center at that distance to sustain life?
Or it's the case that interstelar dust always blocks most energy? Even in a 'polar orbit' around the galaxy's center?
If so, how many of them could exist? More than planets orbiting stars?
