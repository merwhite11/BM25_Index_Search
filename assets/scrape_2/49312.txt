Cosmic rays characteristics/parameters

Where can I get the numerical information about cosmic rays? This is what I need:

Cosmic rays composition: As I found here 99% bare nuclei and 1% electrons. out of 99% bare nuclei: 90% protons, 9% alpha particles, 1% other nuclei of heavier elements. I recaculated it like this:

89.1% - protons
8.91% - alpha particles
1% - electrons
0.99% - nuclei of heavier elements


Average energy of the cosmic ray. There is a graph here but I do not understand what is on the Y axis. It is written $F\ (m2\ sr\ s\ GeV)^{-1}$. Can someone explain what does it means?
Energy flux per square meter per second ($Watt/m^2$). Also, as I understand the graph above is only about energy distribution of the cosmic rays, not about how much energy or particles per square meter per second is coming.
Cosmic rays flux distribution in the Earth atmosphere? Like if altitude is 1000 km it is $10^{-5}Watt/m^2$, if altitude is 100 km it is $XWatt/m^2$, etc.

If anyone knows where to get this information with the source references it will help a lot.
