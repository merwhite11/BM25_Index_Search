Will I age slower in space or on other planets?

I came across few  videos which says Astronauts in ISS will have 0.07 seconds extra life. 
So if life is possible on mars, than what is the time period of life for us humans? Is it the same as that of earth or different?
For example, if I spend 500 days on mars, that will be equal to spending around 515 days on earth. So is it that I'm gaining 15 days of life? I mean, can a human life span increase? 
If a human average life span is 60-80 years on earth, on mars will the average life span of a human be 62-82 years of earth years? Or will it be 60-80 years of Mars years?
I don't know how much this makes sense but as a new learner just got a thought on space time.
