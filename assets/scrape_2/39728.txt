I saw many moving stars moving at high speed and disappearing at the middle. What could it have been?

I saw stars moving one after another and there were many of them. After moving some distance they vanished one by one. it was not a shooting star as they move at high speeds. I am sure it is not satellite because they were many and they were quite fast.
