Does the Sun have different unique orbits around barycenters?

After reading this question and seeing its image I thought about this question I'm going to publish.
Does the Sun have different unique orbits around the barycenter for its multiple planets?
If yes, how does it revolve around all of them? For this it has to exit one orbit and enter another.
