Calculating the angular momentum of stars from Gaia archive (Gaia DR3)

I am trying to calculate the angular momentum for a subset of stars from Gaia DR3. I have scanned the available fields in their database and could only find out the below fields that specifies the position of the stars,

ra, dec: In barycentric coordinates
l, b: Galactic longitude and latitude respectively
ecl_lon, ecl_lat: Ecliptic longitude and latitude respectively

Similarly, we have the following fields that specifies velocities of the stars,

pmra, pmdec: Proper motions along ra and dec respectively.
radial_velocity

From elementary mechanics, angular momentum,
$L_{ang} = mv\times r$ and if I am interested in the specific angular momentum, I divide the angular momentum by $m$ giving me a the expression $L_{ang} = v\times r$ where $r$ is the distance of the object (stars in my case) from the center of mass (LSR and galactic center in my case).
I must calculate the angular momentum in both the LSR frame (Local Standard of Rest frame) and Galactocentric coordinates. I have the below questions,

Any idea how do I map the available data in Gaia to the expressions from mechanics?
Assume that my reasoning is not right, is there an alternative way to calculate the angular momentum of the stars from the available stars?
