Is it safe to look at an annular eclipse during sunrise?

I'm lucky enough to be where an annular eclipse will happen at the same time as sunrise. Usually, it's dangerous to look at an eclipse directly. However, the sun appears much less bright at sunrise.
Is it safe to look directly at an annular eclipse at sunrise?
