How do you mount these binoculars and telescope on this tripod?

Have this telescope and tripod that is missing the 'tripod head platform' to mount to a binoculars or telescope. Can I buy it somewhere? [Photos attached]
I would like to connect the tripod to the D70 telescope, and also this Celestron binoculars that comes with a tripod mount piece that has two screws in it, you could see in the picture on the right of the binoculars.
EDIT: added additional photos
Photos from the Celestron manual, showing the tripod with all parts:
