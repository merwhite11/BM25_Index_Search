Why do white dwarfs cool down so slowly?

I read that when white dwarfs do not proceed with nuclear fusion, the heat radiation from it is solely based on heat it retained in the past
But then, it floats in an almost 0 K empty space. So, why does it take a million (or many many more) years to cool down (to a black dwarf?)?
Shouldn't this temperature difference between them and the environment (space) cool them down much faster?  Or maybe the emptiness of the space causes this very slow temperature outflow?
