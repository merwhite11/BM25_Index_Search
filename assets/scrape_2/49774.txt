How to locate M13, Ring Nebula?

This is a bit last minute. I'm leaving shortly to go camping and expect to have dark skies. I watched NASA What's Up June 2020 which suggested checking out M13 (for which it gave pretty good directions) and also mentioned the Ring Nebula but gave no directions at all. I have some small binoculars and an Astromaster telescope 114. I will have my phone with me, but no internet. Can anyone suggest a good star map I can print? Or give some specific advice about locating these objects?
Or, alternatively, if there's some other nebula visible thru binoculars or this small telescope, I'd be most grateful for suggestions, tips, and printable star maps.
