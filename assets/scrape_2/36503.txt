Different times of sunset at the same location due to elevation

Me and my friend were watching the sunset on the same location (at my country the latitude is approximately 40 degrees). I am at sea level and my friend is at an elevation. He observed the sunset with a difference of about 4 minutes than me. He is a physicist so he challenged me to find out his elevation. Any ideas on how to use these information and win the challenge? 
I found some information on Wikipedia here but cannot understand a lot.
Any idea on how to solve this will be appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help.
