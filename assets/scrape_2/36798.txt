How imperceptible will the 4-July-2020 penumbral lunar eclipse be?

Wikipedia's July 2020 lunar eclipse; Visibility says:

It will be visible from some parts of North America during moonrise, South and North America, the extreme part of Namaqua Land in South Africa and Western Africa (completely visible), and in southwestern Europe, New Zealand, some parts of The Pacific Ocean, Central, East Africa (except Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea and a strip of North Eastern Sudan,Egypt and Ethiopia) and some parts of North Africa and some parts of The Indian Ocean during moonset.

But on the sidebar there is an image that shows the outer edge of the penumbra cutting across the center of the Moon at maximum, which means half of the Moon will be full brightness and the other have only partially shadowed by the Earth.
Question: How much darker with the eclipsed half of the Moon get at maximum? Just how "imperceptible" will the 4-July-2020 penumbral lunar eclipse really be?
