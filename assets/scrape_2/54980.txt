How can telescopes see anything at all?

I'm impressed that we have any telescope imagery at all. Take the images we have from the "Pillars of Creation".
The Pillars of Creation is in the Eagle Nebula, some 7,000 light-years away from Earth. It's estimated its size is about 4 light years.
Does that mean that between those 7,000 light-years, there's absolute nothing in the way that obscures the pillars? Given its arcseconds, I'd expect that any kind of disturbance would make it simply impossible to visualize it.
Also, does that also means that the pillars occupy that portion (albeit minuscule) of the sky permanently? What I wonder is, what is behind the ever growing portion of the sky being hidden by those 4 light years of size?
