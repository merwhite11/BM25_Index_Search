Terran eclipse?

Solar and lunar eclipses are pretty straightforward. But what about eclipses when you are standing on the Moon? I have been trying to Google the info, but there's some gaming clan that has taken the name "terran eclipse" so it's hard to find the real stuff.
I was able to find this article on lunar eclipse from the Moon (the Earth eclipsing the sun). But what about the other way - a solar eclipse observed from the Moon? What would Earth look like? Would anything special be happening on the Moon?
