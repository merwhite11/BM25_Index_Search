Will an observer falling into a black hole be able to witness any future events in the universe outside the black hole?

I know someone or something sucked into a black hole could not survive, but is the bending of light so immense that an observer falling into a black hole will be able to witness any future events in the universe? That would definitely be cool :D I have a feeling this won't work though... so could you explain in detail why? Thanks.
