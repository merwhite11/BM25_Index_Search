Boltzmann brains - probability

A question about the Boltzmann brains assuming heat death of the Universe.
It is said that if so, than it's more likely were are such constructs instead of having reality as we perceive it, however it seems to me that it makes certain (very strict) assumptions about the time, which do not seem proven, e.g. if the time is emergent and related to the entropy change, then the colder the Universe gets the slower passage of time, which would change the probability calculation (e.g. what if time follows on average 1/x), however another variable is that the space itself would get much bigger - would the space itself be enough to still get Boltzmann brain probability higher? How about the accelerated expansion of the Universe due to "dark energy" - would it "dilute" time the same way?
