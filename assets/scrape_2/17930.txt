Are meteorites found everywhere?

I know we can find meteorites from space in Antarctica because snow is white, and we can find them easily on snow. Is it true that meteorites can also be found elsewhere such as beaches, streets or even embedded in a concrete building. It is just very hard to distinguish them from plain rock on earth?
