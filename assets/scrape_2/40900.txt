Line Flux Ratios in Active galaxies

Good day to everyone.
I wanted to know what is the importance of estimation of line flux ratios in active galaxies? What does it help in characterizing?
As in Lyman $\alpha /$Carbon IV, or Mg II$/$Carbon IV, or Carbon III$/$Carbon IV
Do you have any references about this? Kindly do share.
