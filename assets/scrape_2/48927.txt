Could a magnetosphere be created for Venus by recreated by spinning-up the planet to a 24 hour day?

If Venus in it is current state, started rotating  at the same rate as Earths 24hrs rotation, would it develop a magnetic field of roughly the same strength as Earth's?
If so, would that help in any way to thin out the clouds on Venus?
UPDATE
The reason I even asked this question is because, Venus as hellish as it currently is, has one huge advantage over a planet like Mars, it’s size! But until I read Fred’s reply I didn’t know a plants core rotated faster then the plant itself. I thought the core rotated at the same speed as the rest of the planet.
So even if Venuses core was like Earths, it would need to me speeded to almost the speed of Earths core to generate a powerful enough magnetic field or even faster to account for it being closer to the sun?
