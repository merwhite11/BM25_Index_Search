What will "the Earth being consumed by the Sun" look like?

Sometime soon (astronomically speaking) the Sun will, as a main sequence star, expand into a red giant and, potentially, "consume the Earth".
If we take it as read that the surface of Sol will expand past the aphelion of Earth's orbit, what will Earth inside Sol entail, physically speaking, considering Earth as a rock, not an ecosystem, both as the surface of Sol expands past the orbit of Earth, and as the stellar envelope is ejected, leaving Sol as a white dwarf?
