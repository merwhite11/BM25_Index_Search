If the hammer and feather move at the same speed why do comet and the tail particles move at different speeds?

From this exhibition by an astronaut on the moon dropping a hammer and a feather and showing they move at the same speed, why do the particles of the comets tail move away from the comet, slow down and fall away as it disintegrates? Shouldn't they move at the same speed of the comet? 
For example if the feather was attached to the hammer and it was falling and broke off wouldn't it fall at the same speed, not start to trail behind and eventually fall away?
