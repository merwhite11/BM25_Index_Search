Is the solar system barycenter affecting the Earth weather?

I do not have the numbers but I guess the solar system barycenter should move much more than the Earth radius, and if that is correct then it should not be affecting the Earth's temperature.
I mean, even a small change in the proximity to the Sun originated by the axial tilt is causing a big difference in temperatures (summer and winter).
Why don't we see a change in temperature when the barycenter changes? Does it mean that the distance between the Earth and Sun also changes?
