Formula for sun's atmospheric refraction below the horizon

I have searched in Google and found interesting articles for atmospheric refraction influence on sun's elevation above the horizon (from 0째 till 90째).
eg. Bennett G.G. etc.
I would like to know if there is a formula that approximates the refraction when the sun's center is below the horizon (from 0째 to ca. -3째) and taking in account for temperature and air pressure.
