Will Earth rotate backwards in the future?

Hello recently I heave heard the earth will eventually start rotating in the opposite direction (ie sunrise from the west) . I am not sure if this is true, but a lot of sites are claiming it to be true, they say that the earth's rotation is slowing down slowly, and it will eventually stop and start rotating in the opposite direction, please let me know if this is true or not as I do not have much knowledge in astronomy.
EDIT:
Some of the sites that claim this event to be true, explain it in this way -
they say
"The earth is slowing down every year, so much so that when it first started spinning each day was only 4 hours but now it's 24 hours, a day will come when the earth will stop rotating and it will behave like a spring and then it will start rotating in the opposite direction (they don't mention if humans will be alive till that day or not) "
Here are the sources that led me to consider the possibility of this event-
