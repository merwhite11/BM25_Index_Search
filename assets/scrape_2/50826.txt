What experiments can be performed during a solar and lunar eclipse respectively?

As an amateur astronomer, I intend to perform a few simple experiments during total solar and lunar eclipses. However, I am not aware of all the parameters that can change during these eclipses and  hence can't chalk out any experiments. Could anyone suggest some ideas?
