Once a black hole is formed, is there anything other than Hawking radiation which shortens its life?

Hawking radiation is supposed to very slowly evaporate a black hole (terms and conditions apply :] ).
Apart from Hawking radiation, is there any mechanism or effect that can make a black hole cease to exist? Or once they are formed are they expected to exist in this form "forever"?
PS: I posted the same question to Physics but I think it applies well to both SEs. So I hope it is okay to try here as wwell.
