Not able to get Perfect Focus with DSLR and Newtonian

When using DSLR with Newtonian (130mm/1000mm), I am not able to get perfect focus.
However, when I use an eyepiece, I am able to get crystal clear views. So, I think collimation is okay.
The focusing tube is not short. I am able to focus upto a certain point using the DSLR. But the best focus that I am able to get is not crystal clear.
Any suggestions?
Thanks!
