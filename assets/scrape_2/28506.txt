Information on the star at the centre of the Helix "Eye Of God" Nebula

Can someone please tell me what the mass (or size) of the star at the center of the Helix Nebula is, and how much larger it is than our own star (we call the Sun or Sol).  Also, what is the name of this star?  I cannot find a website that addresses these questions.  I believe I have heard, however, that the star is roughly 100 times larger than our sun.
