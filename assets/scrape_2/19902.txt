What is the difference between precession and axial tilt?

I'm a right that the difference is that precession indicates the direction of the inclination of the Earth'axis and the tilt is the quantity of this inclination? So that when there is no tilt there can't be any precession?
And are the inclination degrees of the precession and the tilt related or the same?
It seems that the precession causes different possible polarstar, but is the tilt also have effect on this?
Perhaps this above it not right, so what else is the difference? Is perhaps the precession just the changing of the tilt?
