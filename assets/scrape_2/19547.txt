Is the CMB the photons that were created at the birth of the atom?

Is the CMB that we see the same, unchanged energy from this moment? Does the radiation of the CMB exist as Photons and are we only witnessing the photons that have not been absorbed or destroyed? Will there be a time we can no longer witness the CMB because it has all been absorbed? How does red-shift factor in to this?
