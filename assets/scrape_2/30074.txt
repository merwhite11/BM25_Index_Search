Why do astronauts move so slowly in zero gravity?

When astronauts are floating about in a spaceship or space station, they nearly always move very slowly. After doing a bit of research I can't see why being in zero gravity would restrict movement to such a degree. It's almost as if there's resistance to their movement, like they're moving through water.
