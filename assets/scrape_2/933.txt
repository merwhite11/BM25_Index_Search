What effect does the Earth's rotation have on plate tectonics?

I've been reading up on plate tectonics and found that there are several different driving forces involved. One of the main categories of driving force mentioned on Wikipedia is forces related to the Earth's rotation. The section on driving forces related to Earth rotation presents the information as a sort of historical dialogue of the scientific process, which is somewhat helpful but has left me confused as to exactly what role the Earth's rotation does play in plate tectonics.
So how does rotation affect the movement of plates?
