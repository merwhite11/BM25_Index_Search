Did Tycho Brahe improve measurements twentyfold?

I am reading a book on the Coopernican Revolution where the author states that Tycho Brahe was able to make twenty times more accurate measurements than any of his predecessors.
On the other hand, I remember having heard a lecture where the speaker said that Tycho did not significantly improve measurements since Ptolemy because no new equipment (telescope) had been invented.
So, which statement is correct?
