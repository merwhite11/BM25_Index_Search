Is the nose of the solar system and the solar apex the same thing?

Results from the IBEX satellite indicate the nose of the solar system is pointing to the constellation Scorpius.  Various sources say the solar apex is pointing to the constellation Hercules.
Are the two different, or is simply the information about the location in conflict?
