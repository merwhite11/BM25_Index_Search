What class of elements are providing the many electrons needed to make the H- ion?

Continuous absorption by the H- ion reaches its maximum in the cool atmospheric layers of G stars.  At these temperatures, most of the hydrogen atoms are neutral; but what class of elements is providing the many electrons needed to make the H- ion?
