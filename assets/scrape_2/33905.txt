Troop of moving stars through a straight line

Last night,I and my brother suddenly saw that some(50-60) dots of light( exactly like stars)  were moving through a straight line(from NW to SE) above us  with same velocity and towards exactly same directions.These moving stars were seen for just a few seconds.Then they didn't disappear, they just crossed us. We became confused. My brother is highly interested in astronomy. But he was unable to detect the phenomenon. I think this case is rare.  What may they be?
