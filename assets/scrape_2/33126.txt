Does astro means space or stars

In the popular TV show The Big Bang Theory Season 3, Episode 4, Sheldon Cooper said that astro means star and Raj said astro means space, I got a little confused here, various websites and others are going 50-50 on the subject. What does astro actually means?

Raj: No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?
Sheldon: Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
Raj: I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
Sheldon: Astro means star.
