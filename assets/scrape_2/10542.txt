Habitable Planet around Red Dwarf

Is there the possibility for a habitable Planet around a red dwarf? It is not required that the whole surface is habitable, but it shouldn't be a tiny spot.
After reading a bit I assume the planet would be tidally locked to the star, with the side that faces the sun looking like an archery-target (from center to border: scorching, hot, warm, cold, freezing).
Also from space it would look like a Rugby Ball (exaggerated) pointed at the star. 
But would such a planet be stable enough to develop and support life more complex than the simplest forms? 

I do not need a specific star, but the general answer if this is possible, however unlikely (though a value how unlikely would be nice).
