First meteor(s) of Lyrid meteor shower?

So I am a newcomer to Astronomy - only aged 15 - and am currently looking upon the sky in hopes of witnessing several meteors. This is my first time ever - maybe - seeing them. I just went inside for food and drink, come out and i saw a trail (this trail was not here before I went in). I do have a few doubts, one it was seen below the moon, when it was supposedly meant to be near Vega - however I read about them having a tendency to be different to predictions. Also, considering it is so close to the Moon and I can't currently see Vega from this position I highly doubt it.
please view the below image in the hopes of identifying the object (please excuse the camera quality, I am currently setting up the DSLR and this was photographed on my Nexus.)
