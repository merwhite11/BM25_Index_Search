How can I compute the shape and orientation of the crescent for a given time and geographic location using data from the JPL Horizons?

I can compute the following data for the Moon for a given time and geographic location using the JPL Horizons system:

Apparent RA & DEC
Apparent azimuth & elevation (AZ-EL)
Target range & range rate (relative to observer)
Illuminated fraction
Phase angle and bisector

Is it feasible to compute the shape and orientation of the crescent from this data and if yes
how is the computation procedure.
I would be grateful if any one can answer this question for me.
