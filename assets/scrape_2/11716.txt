What are iron stars?

I have a question about iron stars. I was fascinated about the theory about the inability of protons to decay, and it led me to a point where I read something about some special kind of star called an "iron star". Can anybody enlighten me a bit, if possible, on what exactly it is and why it may be significant? And how do iron stars form?
