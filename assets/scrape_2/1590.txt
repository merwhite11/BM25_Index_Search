Is there anything special about our position in the galaxy thats necessary for life?

It's a fact that our planet's location from our parent star (among other factors) is of crucial importance to the existence of life. But can our position in the galaxy be considered a factor when considering potential planets to carry life?
In any given position in the galaxy for instance there are distinct radiation levels, distinct gravitational effects, space-time, etc. These factors could contribute to the existence of life on earth or even its continuity, wouldn't they?
