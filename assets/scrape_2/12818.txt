Does gravity bend light, and how much time does it take for light to cross gravity of a Black Hole?

This is very confusing to me, so the question might be same. Please go through it, if required i will add more text.
According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, photons are not technically affected by large gravitational fields; instead space and time become distorted around massive objects and the light simply follows this distorted curvature of space.
My questions are:
1) For example: 1 hour near a black hole, is equivalent to 100 Years on Earth. If the light travels through this distorted space and time around a black hole, how much earth time does it take for light to cross the black hole's gravity?
2) We say the Universe is 14 Billion Years old, and its diameter is 91 Billion Light Years approximatly. My assumption is, these age and diameter of universe is based on the measurement of the light travel (Light is one of the factor in many).
3) So, if first (1) and second (2) points are right, how can we say the Universe is created 14 Billion Years ago (if light takes 100 Earth Years to cross over the black hole's gravity)?
