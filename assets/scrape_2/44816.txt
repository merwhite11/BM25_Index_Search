What can I see with different apertures?

I'm looking to buy a telescope, and every mainstream website says that aperture is the most important factor, and buy the largest telescope your budget can afford. However, a website I found offering more practical advice stated that there were all too many large telescopes being sold by amateurs, listed as seldom used because of the difficulty in using them, and larger telescopes take on more light pollution anyways. But now that I value portability more,
I haven't been able to find a decent guide on how much the quality of view increases per aperture increase. Can anyone describe what I can expect to see through telescopes of different apertures? (For example, object X will become detailed at aperture Z.)
