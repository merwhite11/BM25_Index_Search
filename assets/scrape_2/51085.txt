What estimate can be made of the time before a change in the Sun's intensity would make the earth uninhabitable?

From observation of stars we know that there are many types of stars that evolve over time and change and this known as stellar evolution. Over time a star changes in its size and in the intensity of its radiation.
Based on our observation of other stars, what estimate can be made of the time remaining before changes in the sun's intensity would render the earth uninhabitable?
Note that my question is about observation of the intensity of radiation from other stars during their evolution (is that even measurable?). This is not a question about terrestrial climate effects.
