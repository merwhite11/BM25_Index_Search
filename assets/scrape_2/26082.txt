Can a black hole undergo a Penrose process inside another black hole's ergosphere?

I recently watched this video on black holes:

And that statement should give you an idea of my level of understanding :)
I was wondering if a spinning black hole A could complete a Penrose process through another spinning black hole B's ergosphere. i.e. if it could travel through the ergosphere of another spinning black hole and emerge out of it the other side.  What would happen?  Perhaps this is related to the question of whether black holes can orbit each other (in two or three-body system)?  What happens if black holes orbit each other, but their ergospheres overlap?
