How does JWST position itself to see and resolve an exact target?

Let's say the James Webb Space Telescope wants to move from observing the Andromeda galaxy millions of light years away to looking at the Trappist-1e planet some dozens of light years away, what actions are need to change targets and find and resolve that target?
I think I read it has jet propulsion for movement, but does it have a different system for fine movement? It seems like jetting around would be extremely finicky.
I imagine Hubble has to do something similar but I never heard how that works either.
