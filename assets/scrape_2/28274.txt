Does a star fuse helium to beryllium on the main sequence?

When a star has finished fusing all its hydrogen into helium, it will then start fusing helium into beryllium and so on and so forth up until iron.  
When the star is fusing to beryllium, will the star still be in the main sequence phase and will it at that point start to grow into the red giant phase, or is there no given rule for when it will start growing?
