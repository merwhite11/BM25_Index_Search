Surface height distribution for Jupiter's moon Io?

The moon Io has around 100 mountains:

These structures average $6 {\rm\, km}$ in height and reach a maximum of ${\rm 17.5 \pm 1.5\, km}$

I am now looking for the overall histogram, i.e. elevation distribution of Io's surface and/or a hypsometric curve for Io.
