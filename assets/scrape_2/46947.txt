Will there be collision between universes?

I just watched one of those videos that shows the scale of the universe, zooming out from one thing all the way out to the sphere that is thought to be the universe. However, they also showed other universes outside our own, and they made it seem like a universe is right next to others in space. I have often heard that our universe is expanding, so I just want to ask: What would happen if one universe expanded enough to collide with another, and what would this look like from inside one of the universes?
