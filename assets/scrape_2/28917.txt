How does a star's rotation affect a star on the main sequence?

I searched and have found that the questions mainly focus on neutron stars, white dwarfs and black holes. This was not what I want.
Basically, the bigger the star's mass is, the more intense its fusion reaction is and the shorter its lifespan is in the main sequence. Now, imagine that a star spins much faster. There will be lower surface gravity at the equator than at the poles. How does a fast rotation affect the star's fusion reaction?

Will the pressure of the star's mass on its core be lower at the equator and therefore reduce nuclear fusion rate?

Will there be a deeper convection because of the Coriolis effect?

What would we notice in term of longevity on the main sequence, luminosity and the emission spectrum of a fast rotating star compared to a slow rotating one of the same initial mass?
