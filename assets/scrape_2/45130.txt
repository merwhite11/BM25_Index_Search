How do scientists know that Earth used to spin much more rapidly?

News has just been released all over my news feeds about how paleontologists now believe that early photosynthetic organisms became much more efficient at producing oxygen after the Earth started to slow down more and more, going from a 4- or 4.5-hour day-night cycle shortly after its creation to something closer to our current 24-hour cycle....
My question is; how do they know that the Earth used to rotate so much faster, so long ago?
Are they basing this assumption on computer models of planet formation?
Or, the fact that every few years the Grand International Timekeepers Guild (or whoever) adds a second to the end of the year, on New Years' Eve.....
