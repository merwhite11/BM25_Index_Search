Bad syntax for region SIMPLE -- dmextract CIAO 4.15

I am trying to perform a radial profile analysis using Chandra's CIAO 4.15 dmextract function but keep getting the following error: "bad syntax for region SIMPLE". I cannot find any relevant documentation on the site regarding this issue, and it is not touched on in the 4.15 bugs page. Has anyone else run into this issue? If so, have you found a resolution, or can the issue be chalked up to too faint of data?
