What is a debris field called before it becomes a planetary ring?

As a body of a suitable size and mass moves within the Roche limit of a planet, it will disintegrate. This will form a debris field that will eventually form a planetary ring. Is there a name given to this debris field before it forms a ring? Something like a Roche train or Roche field seem appropriate but I can't find any reference to such
