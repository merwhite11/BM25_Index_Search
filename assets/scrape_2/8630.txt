PowerSeeker 114Q

I just purchased a powerseeker 114q by Celestron. This is my very first telescope. I believe I assembled it correctly however I can't see anything out of it. Well I can see a small corner of an image. When I look at the reflector in the back of the telescope, I can see a small part of my face. It is the same when I look through the lens. I only can see a small piece of the sky. I think its the sky anyway. The rest is completely black. All of the lens caps are off. I followed the setup directions down to the letter. Can someone please help.
