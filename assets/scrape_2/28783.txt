What is the bright star or planet in eastern sky on dec 18 2018?

What is the bright star or planet in eastern sky on Dec 18 2018 in Laurens SC. It is very bright and beautiful on a clear night. I have been seeing it for about a month or more. It seems to follow the same path as the moon. This object is sighted at sundown to sunset. Is it a star or a planet? It is very bright and does not twinkle.
