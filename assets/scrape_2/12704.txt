Can a star orbit around multiple planets or a planet with massive moons?

Note: I'm not talking about a star orbiting around a single or lonely planet :)
I know a star orbiting a planet is almost impossible because if a planet is more massive than a star, that "planet" would probably be a star. But how about if the planet is not lonely like:

A multiple planetary system which consists of free floating planets only but the planets are so massive so that their total mass is larger than a star
A planet itself is not more massive than a star but it has so many massive moons

Is it possible for a very small star to orbit around planets in such situations?
