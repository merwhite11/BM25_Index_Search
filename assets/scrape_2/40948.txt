How many solar system objects that can really qualify as a KBO are likely to enter Pluto's Hill sphere each day?

A comment below Which celestial body is able to come closest to Pluto? says that

Technically, many, many small Kuiper belt objects enter Pluto's Hill Sphere (or sphere of influence SOI) every day.

Pluto is small, but it is very far from the Sun, so maybe its Hill Sphere could be surprisingly large, and if we called each particle of dust out there a "small Kuiper belt object" then this can be true.
Question: But realistically, how many solar system objects that can really qualify as a KBO are likely to enter Pluto's Hill sphere each day?
For the purposes of this question let's see if there is some way to ascertain what a KBO might be, and not focus on the helpful comment too much.
