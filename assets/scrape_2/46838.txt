How much are the benefits of installing a telescope in orbit?

I know that our atmosphere acts like a protective blanket letting only some light through while blocking others. We send telescopes to orbit to get a clearer view of space objects.
I want to know that how much is this benefit. How clear, detailed and helpful-to-study are the pictures compared to pictures from ground based telescopes?
