Is it true dark matter was discovered whilst looking at the rotational speed of galaxies?

Just a little something whilst a dark matter pioneer moves onto a better place.

My understanding is that dark matter was "discovered" when trying to find out why stars in the outer edge of a galaxy rotates with the same speed as the inner. A ten-fold increase in number of galaxies doesn't seem to affect this.

When reading the history - this simple explanation doesn't quite come across. Perhaps the statement above is oversimplified. For example:

mass in the galactic plane must be greater than what was observed (doesn't quite talk about comparative rotational velocity)
estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge (doesn't quite talk about comparative rotational velocity)
some unseen matter provided the mass and associated gravitation attraction to hold the cluster together (doesn't quite talk about comparative rotational velocity)
measurements of galaxy rotation curves (what is a galaxy rotational curve? Shouldn't it be a straight line if they're rotating at the same angular velocity?)
gravitational lensing of background objects by galaxy clusters (not talking about comparative rotational velocity?)

My question is: Is it true dark matter was discovered whilst looking at the rotational speed of galaxies?
