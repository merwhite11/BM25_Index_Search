Is the turn-off point of the main sequence the same as the terminal-age main sequence?

The turn-off (TO) point is one tipping point on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) where low-mass stars start to evolve from the main sequence (MS) toward lower temperatures. If I understand it correctly, this is the beginning of the sub-giant phase when the stars no longer have hydrogen burning at the core.
The definition above suggests that the TO point is the same as the terminal age main sequence (TAMS), however, I have not found a source that explicitly states so.
Is the TO point the same as the TAMS?
