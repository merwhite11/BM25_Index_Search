Is there any evidence that the Gas Giant planets in our solar system are experiencing orbital migration?

Planetary migration is defined by Lubow and Ida (2010) in their article Planet Migration as 

the process by which a planetâ€™s orbital radius changes in time. The
  main agent for causing gas giant planet migration is the gravitational interaction of the young
  planet with the gaseous disk from which it forms.

Relevant, it is believed by some that the gas giant planets in our solar system experienced orbital migration.  According to the article Wandering Gas Giants and Lunar Bombardment (Taylor, 2006), as an example,

Outward migration of Saturn might have triggered a dramatic increase in the bombardment rate on the Moon 3.9 billion years ago, an idea testable with lunar samples.

So my question is is there any evidence (not opinions) to suggest any form of migration occurring with our solar system's gas giants?
