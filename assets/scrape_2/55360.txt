Why did the dust between the planets disappear during the birth of the solar system?

I'm catching up on my childhood mistakes. One of them was the "nuclear flash", the enormous explosion when the sun ignited. Apparently, this did not happen as the ignition of the sun was a gradual process, not a violent one, as explained in this question.
A consequence of that childhood mistake was the idea that, through that explosion, the dust between the (proto)planets was blown away, explaining why the solar system is empty, except for the planets and their moons (the asteroid belt and Oort cloud are again other phenomena).
However, as the Sun's ignition was not an explosion, then what happened with the dust between the (proto)planets?
