What fraction of a star's hydrogen store will be fused over its lifespan?

A main sequence star will fuse some of its hydrogen, but not all. In massive stars ($>1.5M_\odot$) the core is convective but the rest of the atmosphere radiative and hence does not mix much: as it undergoes shell fusion it will produce an onion-like structure with unused hydrogen on top. Solar mass stars only do this up to helium, but again leave a mantle of unused hydrogen. Stars less than $0.35M_\odot$ are fully convective and can in principle use up all hydrogen. However, I suspect this is not complete except for very low-mass M dwarves that have trillions of years to mature.
Looking at planetary nebulae, I have seen statements that they are about 90 percent hydrogen, 10 percent helium. This seems to fit with papers I have found (example, example) although in some cases helium may reach 29% (example). Given that for a G star about half of the mass is ejected, that would suggest a fraction $0.9\times 0.5 = 0.45$ of unused hydrogen. But surely the fractions will be different for other masses.
So, to sum up, what is known about the fraction of hydrogen that is never fused over a stellar lifetime?
