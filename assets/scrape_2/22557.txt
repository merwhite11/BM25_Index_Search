Could the expansion of universe be a side effect of gravity?

Could the expansion of universe be a side effect of gravity? I mean maybe gravity "attracts things" at a "small" distances and repells them at "larger" distances?
Do we have any theory/hypothesis/paper on this topic? Is it possible to prove or disprove?
UPD.
There is another, more clear way to ask the same question:

Could gravity have a repulsive term that dominates at cosmological
  distances and could it be such a term that causes (accelerated)
  expansion?

Thanks to @uhoh and @Richard, for helping to clarify question a bit.
