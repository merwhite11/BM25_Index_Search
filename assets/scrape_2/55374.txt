Why is space having no atmosphere a good explanation for the Olber's paradox?

why is space dark? that is because there is no atmosphere to scatter the light.
why are we pretending that if we have had enough visible light from all those distant start, the space would light up. i mean it still wouldn't? does the space around sun lights up? no
can someone explain this, please? i feel like i am missing something completely obvious.
