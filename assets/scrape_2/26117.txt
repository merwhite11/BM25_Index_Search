Understanding expected TESS data structure

I'm interested in trying to use the data that will be returned by TESS to apply some machine learning/computer sciences concepts. I'm not sure yet what I want to try to do with it (though I have some ideas - see end comments). This because I don't really understand the data structure it will be using. 
So essentially I would like to first some help to get a high-level view of how the TESS data is structured. Then a bit of guidance as to how I could visualize it/get started with some basic example 
Additional info/what I know at this point
I've checked out the MAST page. It details what type of FITS documents will be returned.
I have downloaded samples of some of these data products and I see they all come in FITS format. On Ubuntu, you can open that in Aladin. However Aladin in itself is a fairly involved piece of software. Do I need Aladin for this, or are there simple alternatives to just view the data quickly to help get a feel for what it means? In other words what kind of navigator do you use for FITS files?
I'm pretty new to astronomy - I'm coming at this rather from a computer science perspective. Some basic suggestions as to what kind of observation an amateur astronomer might want to look at would be welcomed if you have some.
The data linked above (MAST page) are simulated data (real data will only be available in a couple months). This is fine - mostly interested in being functional with the data when they arrive.
Data analysis ideas:

Using kmeans or similar to try to extract  what are some of the "typical" transit light curves

Generating those transit light curves from the raw data, say from a target pixel
