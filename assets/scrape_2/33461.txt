Why is ice on Mars not covered in dust?

There's exposed water ice on Mars, like in craters like this
At the same time, Mars has dust storm, covering the solar panels of rovers, and occasionally covering the entire planet
So why is this ice not covered in dust?
I understand that dry carbon dioxide ice can maintain a clean surface, as it's seasonally sublimated into the atmosphere and re-deposited, but how come water ice (at least some of it) is also left clean?
