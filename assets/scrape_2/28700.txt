What might a CN filter be in the context of comet watching? Is it showing dust, or gas, or something else?

In this post on the website for the Comet Wirtanen Observing Campaign at wirtanen.astro.umd.edu, there's mention of a CN filter being used to observe the comet, and this cool GIF.
What exactly is a CN filter? What wavelengths does it pass? Where can I read more about it? Why is it showing a spiral shape of stuff being emitted from comet 46P? Is this comet dust, gas, something else?
