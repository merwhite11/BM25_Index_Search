Does astronomical observing "count" as remote sensing?

I have long considered astronomical observing as a form of remote sensing, though quite different than typical remote sensing in that many objects observed are not resolved.
I am wondering, though, if the  formal definitions of remote sensing include or exclude astronomical observing (and specifically, observing things outside the solar system)?  And/or are there any resources that can be pointed to that either do or don't call astronomical observing remote sensing?
