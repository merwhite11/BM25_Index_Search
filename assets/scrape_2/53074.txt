Angular extent of this composite Chandra / JWST image of the Tarantula Nebula?

I thought I’d ask this question here, as I couldn’t readily find the answer looking through online resources.
What is the angular extent of the composite Chandra / JWST image of the Tarantula Nebula that was released in January of 2023?
I’d like to have a rough estimate of how big this image is, relative to the entire celestial sphere.
