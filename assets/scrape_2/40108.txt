What was there before the big bang

we know that our universe is expanding, but we must agree to the fact that it has a limit. It just cant expand till infinity. Eventually there will be a end to time. I thought alot about this and i have a idea that before big bang there was nothing except time and a room like structure in which the big bang happened and the walls of the room are the limits of the universe. It does not mean all there was before big bang a room, but it was the room in which our universe came to existence. After The Big Crunch i believe the room will contain nothing it just like before big bang. Now I want to know that does this idea of mine have any logic?
