Which lens is right to see which planets with an Orion StarSeeker 150 mm?

I'm an amateur astronomy lover and I have an Orion StarSeeker IV 150 mm, together with a bunch of lenses, which are the following:
1x 23mm (32.6x) and 1x 10mm (75x) wide-field 60-degree eyepieces 1x Plössl 32mm 1x Plössl 12,5mm 1x Plössl 6mm 1x Plössl 4mm 1x Barlow lens 2x 1x green filter No.56 1x red filter No. 23A 1x yellow filter No.12 1x orange filter No.21 1x blue filter No.82A 1x polarizer filter 1x lunar filter Crystal View.
I've been able to see the moon using the Barlow Lens and a 10mm lens, but I can't see other planets, star clusters and other stellar objects. I've searched on the internet, but haven't been able to find information that is understandable for an amateur, so here I am. 
Which lens is best to see which planets and star clusters?
Thanks to whoever will help me :)
