Why does the precession of the earth affect other planets?

In the Wikipedia article on numerical integration of planetary motion it states:

...the flattening of the Earth causes precession, which causes the
  axial tilt to change, which affects the long-term movements of all
  planets.

Why would precession affect the motion of the other planets?
