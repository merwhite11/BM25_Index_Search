What is a Seyfert galaxy?

I know Seyfert galaxies are types of active galaxies, but I do not understand what separates them from other types of active galaxies.  Are they brighter/not as bright as other types of active galaxies?  Do they emit in different wavelengths relative to other active galaxies?  I've read that 10% of all galaxies are Seyfert galaxies, so it seems to me that understanding what these galaxies are is very important to understanding galaxies overall.
