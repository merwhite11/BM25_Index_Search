What's the difference between a Newtonian telescope and a regular telescope

So, recently I was shopping for telescopes and I decided on the following telescope:
https://www.amazon.com/Celestron-21049-127EQ-PowerSeeker-Telescope/dp/B0007UQNKY/
I had exactly $180 to spend, and that telescope fit the bill. However, I also noticed that it had a variety of options in sizes, mainly the following:

60MM EQ Refractor 
70MM EQ Refractor 
80MM EQ Refractor
114MM EQ Reflector
127EQ Newtonian Reflector

What is the difference between all these sizes/types, how does a "Newtonian Reflector" act differently than a "regular" (for lack of a better term) reflector and what are the benefits/drawbacks? 
Bonus Points: Did I choose the "highest-quality" option for the price?

Side-by-side comparison of all sizes:
