Are gravitational waves red-shifted?

Gravitational waves originate from significant distances. Presumably they are red-shifted the same amount as the galaxies they originated in. In the absence of gravitational “spectral lines”, can this red shift be measured? And if it can be, is this information useful in calculating distance or inferring the event that created the gravitational waves?
