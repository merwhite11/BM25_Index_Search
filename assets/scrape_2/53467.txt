Planet and star rotation through gas in the galaxy

If 10% of the galaxy is filled with gasses, and stars contribute to only 1%â€“2% of the total matter, then shouldn't the gas create friction for the movement of stars around the galactic center and also for planets around a star?
For example, if earth is revolving around the sun through a gaseous medium, then the friction due to gas should keep decelerating the earth. Why is this not happening?
