Earendel galaxy, 12.9 billion light-years and the human eye?

Since a telescope is just a very powerful eye, if it took the light of Earendel 12.9 billion years for it to reach the Hubble telescope, how long would it take for that same light to reach a human eye? I guess the light from Earendel would need to travel even more so that I can see it.
Or is the distance so minimal that it's not even worth considering?
It's just a theoretical question, since I assume I will never see Earendel from my balcony.
