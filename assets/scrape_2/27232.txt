"Lunar tropics"

The tropics is region of the Earth in which the Sun could be directly overhead.  What is the corresponding region for the Moon?  Is it the same or slightly larger?  
I live in the UK and hence have to travel quite far to see the Sun directly overhead.  If I am content to see the Moon directly overhead, would my trip be much shorter?  
My experience suggests so.  Once long ago, I travelled to India without flying.  I "saw" the Moon directly overhead while in Iran and hence not yet in the Tropics.  However, I had no way to accurately measure this and I may have mistaken the usually high (for me) Moon for being exactly overhead.
