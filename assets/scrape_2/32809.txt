Could the Universe really be 12.5-13 billion years old?

My initial reaction is that "this must be wrong" and apparently that's a lot of people's initial reaction according to the article.

My question is, is this study actually making scientists scratch their heads, and, 2nd part, if accurate, how could the 13.78 (or whatever it is) estimate have been wrong, as it seemed to be the result of more and more accurate estimates over time.
One of the two estimates has to be wrong.
