Does our current understanding of the mass of black hole only allow for it to be located at the singularity?

Does the distribution of mass or density of mass inside the event horizon matter for a black hole to exist as we currently theorize? Could the mass inside the event horizon be distributed in any way at all, or have any density so long as it is dense enough to locate 100% of the mass inside the Schwarzschild radius?
