What would James Webb Space Telescope be able to see if pointed at Earth?

I have seen comparisons of the picture quality between Hubble and Webb, and I have read that the size of the pictures Webb is taking is akin to holding a grain of sand at arms length against the sky.
Still, I'm not able to comprehend how far these objects are or have a grasp on how much light is coming through.
I thought then that, hypothetically, if Webb would be pointed at Earth, and would be able to capture at similar range (ignoring all the impossibilities of doing so), what would show up in the pictures? A house? A pixel in a monitor? Molecules?
