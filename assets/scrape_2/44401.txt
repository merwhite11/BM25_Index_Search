How do astronomers calculate the period about the wave motion of the solar system in the Milky Way?

According to research, excluding the motion of the entire galaxy, astronomers found the motion of the solar system in the Milky Way.

The solar system revolve around the galactic bulge of the Milky Way.
Due to the axis of the sun, the mass of the galactic plane or something else, the path of the solar system passing thorugh the galactic plane looks like a wave as shown in the pictures below.

From the research, a single wave takes about 60 million years. The solar system passed through the galactic plane about 30,000 years ago, currently it is above the galactic plane.
How did the astronomers calculate the period? How did they find the highest and lowest point of the path?
I can understand the wave's path of the solar system due to the mass of the galaxy, I'm just curious how to calculate it.
