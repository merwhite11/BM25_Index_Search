Feasibility of detecting earth-like exoplanets with amateur telescopes

An approximation of the dimming of exoplanet transits can be obtained by dividing the areas of the disks of the exoplanet and star by each other.
Taking the radii of Jupiter and our sun results in an area ratio of (69,911 km)^2 / (696,340 km)^2 = 0.0101, so a brightness change in the 1%-5% range most exoplanets detected by the transit method are in.
This is possible to observe even with amateur telescopes, but Earth-like planets seem to be much more difficult:
Earth's ratio to the sun, having an area only a tenth of Jupiter (6,371 km), is 0.0000837, or roughly 1/12000, approximately 100 times smaller.
Assuming one uses a 16-bit camera, if the exposure time is optimized to be just below saturation, this would amount to a 5-6 count difference - which seems incredibly small, but perhaps possible to reliably detect/confirm with statistical methods?
