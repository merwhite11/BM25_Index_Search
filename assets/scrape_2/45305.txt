Why are fewer stars seen next to the horizon?

I was in the desert the other day, in an area that was free of light pollution.
While it was easy to see the stars above us, I noticed that near the horizon, even when there is no distance light, we can see almost no stars.
Is this normal? What is causing this? Is it air pollution that covers the Earth and is denser when looking at the horizon? Is it just the density of the atmosphere itself?
