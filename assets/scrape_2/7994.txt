How can there be anything "beyond" the CMB?

Two things we take, for this purpose, to be axiomatic:

The CMB is the oldest thing we can observe directly
The cosmological red shift tells us how "old" something we are observing is

Yet we also have a third axiom:

There are some parts of the universe we can never observe because they are receding away from us at a superluminary speed.

But this surely also implies that we can see beyond the CMB if we see anything which has a red shift indicating an expansion speed very close to $c$.
This suggests axiom 2 is incorrect - so what should it be instead?
