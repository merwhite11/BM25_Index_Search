How does light so travel so fast?.

I've read that photon's have zero mass, hence no force is needed to accelerate them. But then the second question. How can gravity affect something which has 0 mass?. Yes, gravity(black hole) can bend space and time but how can 0 mass particle be affected by this?. What am i missing.?
