Did Mercury clear its neighborhood?

For a body to qualify as a planet according to the IAU definition it must have "cleared its neighborhood". What evidence is there Mercury indeed cleared its neighborhood? Perhaps it migrated there afterwards, when the neighborhood had already been cleared. Does the Grand Tack hypothesis impact our definition of the inner planets as planets?

See Grand Tack Hypothesis.
The present definition of a planet is vulnerable as it seems connected to a model of formation of the solar system. The answer below states that in practice an operational definition used that I believe is adequate.
