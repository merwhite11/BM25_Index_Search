Schmidt corrector plate on a Newtonian = Schmidt Cassegrain?

Went on with a wide range of telescopes and its mechanics. To my understanding, the only change in the optical function in Schmidt Cassegrain telescope is a Schmidt's corrector plate in front of an Newtonian telescope. And the secondary mirror placed exactly opposite to the primary mirror with a hole with diameter < of the diameter of secondary mirror to let the light reach the eyepiece placed at the back of the telescope, Where in Newtonian the secondary mirror is inclined 45 degrees to make the light erect so that it reaches the eyepiece are some of the mechanical and physical changes. So, Is my understanding correct ? If We add a Schmidt corrector plate in front of a Newtonian telescope, does this change make it a Cassegrain one ?. And why the light is sent back of the telescope by the secondary mirror in Cassegrain and not erecting it to the eyepiece like it is in Newtonian ?
