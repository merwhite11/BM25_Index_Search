Cosmic Microwave Background Map

When a satellite takes measurements of the radiation from different patches of the sky to construct a map of the thermal radiation of the universe on the surface of a sphere, it would also contain radiation from the Milky Way, for one.
A big patch of the map will have noise due to the objects in the Milky Way or from other sources.
How does one know where and how much noise to remove while constructing the map?
