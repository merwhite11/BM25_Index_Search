Calculate object apparent diameter by distance and radius

I'm trying to create a dynamic starfield for game using the HYG database. Because there are no data about the apparent size of the stars from earth, I will need to get it myself. I found a formula which calculate the radius by the temperature and the luminosity of the star. It's working, but the problem is that because a lot of stars are very far, I normalize the distance of the stars so they are all at the same distance in the game engine(they form a dome around the scene). I'm looking for a way to set the size of the stars in the sky, even if normalized, using the radius of the stars, and the real distance from earth. I tried: Distance / radius, but the size of the stars make no sense, betelgeuse is 10 times larger than bellatrix, but they should be almost equivalent.
