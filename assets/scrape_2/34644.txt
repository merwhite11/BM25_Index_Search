Verifying refractor lens about scratches

I found an used Skywatcher 70mm telescope for buying, but its lenses are a little suspect about harming. In one photo, it looks clearly a scratch, but in the another, it is not visible. Could it be an optical illusion or is it really a harm? If it's a scratch, should I discard the possibility of buying?
