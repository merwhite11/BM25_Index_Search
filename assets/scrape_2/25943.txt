Are we really seeing the asteroids from the past?

Is it actually relevant to study objects that are light years far? Because in theories we are actually seeing the past as the light takes years to reach us.
Lets say we are studying a asteroid that is going to hit as after several hundred years how can we confirm we are truly studying the actually position and everything of that object as we are seeing object from the past.
