Which star did Uranus occult in 1977 when the planet's rings were discovered?

In 1977, Uranus occulted a star, and the starlight flickered 40 minutes before and after the actual occultation, revealing Uranus' rings.This is common knowledge to astronomers, but what I can't find out is which star Uranus occulted. Can someone give me the name of this star?
