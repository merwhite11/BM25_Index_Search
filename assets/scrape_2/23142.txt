Could a binary system of two planets with oceans reflect each other?

If there were two earth-like planets in a binary system and one of them had landmasses, and the other one had oceans covering a significant amount of its surface, could you see the continents of the first planet reflected onto the oceans of the second one?
If so, could this also work with oceanic moons?
