Is it possible the Nebular Hypothesis and Planetesimal Theory are not correct?

For almost 3 centuries now the Nebular Hypothesis and Planetesimal Theory have become the preeminent explanations for how the Solar System and Planets evolved. Yet there is still no explanation for how Comets and Moons occur in the Solar System, and the Planetary explanation is still considered Theory. Is it possible that they are not correct? Yet since they hold such wide acceptance are actually preventing the discovery of how Comets, Moons, and Planets originate in a Solar System in an all inclusive explanation.
