What is the difference between our time and space time?

I am trying to understand the phenomenon of space-time. But, everything on internet seems to be too complicated for me since I do not have a background in physics. Can anyone give me simple explanations for the following:

What is the difference between time and space-time?
How does gravity affect the passage of time? 
What is the speed of light and how does it relate to time? 
How do scientists deal with timescales on the order of billions of years if time is not constant for all observers in the universe?
How is time, or for example the age of the universe, actually measured experimentally?
