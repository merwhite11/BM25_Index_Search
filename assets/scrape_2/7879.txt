How deep and shaped is the depth of a black hole?

A common representation of a black hole is a black circle which if I'm correct, indicates its breadth.
This representation depicts it as a 'plate', so a really small depth compared to its breadth.
On this other representation, its depth has a funnel shape.
Question:
How deep and what shape has the depth of a black hole ?
