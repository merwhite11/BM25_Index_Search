Can one detect from earth that angular momenta of its axial rotation and its orbital rotation are "almost parallel"?

I mean that the angle between these angular momenta is acute as opposed to obtuse (23.5 and not 180-23.5), so that the rotations are "roughly in the same direction". 
Related but distinct question -- when was this actually discovered?
