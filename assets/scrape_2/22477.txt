What would be the required conditions for a lunar eclipse to occur only once on a precise annual basis?

As I am aware, lunar eclipses can take place several times a year on Earth. However, I am curious whether it would be possible for this event to only occur once annually on a specific date (and preferably on the same face of the planet) if the moon's angular orbit around Earth were to be altered from 5Â°.
To put it bluntly:
How would the components causing a lunar eclipse need to be altered for a singular 'blood moon' to be able to appear reliably every year on say the 25th of September? If it is at all possible.
Additionally, would these alterations cause any other significant effects between the Earth and Moon?
