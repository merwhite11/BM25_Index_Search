Assuming a hypothetical system without gas but only solid rocks, how big of a planet can form through the coalescing of these rocks?

I have heard that gas giants are primarily huge solid bodies like regular rocky planets that exponentially gained more and more gas in their atmosphere through their increase in mass which  they use to  pick up even more mass ,gaining even more gas, and practically any planet we know today above a certain size threshold is a gas giant
That being said, assuming an area in space with very little or no gas but a bountiful supply of rocks, how big can a solid planet consisting of these coalesced rocks get?
