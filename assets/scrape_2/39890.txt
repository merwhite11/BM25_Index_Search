Can Gravitational astronomy look beyond the CMB?

In another question dealing with the earliest explored phenomenon in the Universe the observing limit of the CMB was mentioned.  Prior to CMB the Universe was opaque to photons, I believe.  I'm wondering if conditions before "first light" would have allowed sufficient matter clumping to produce currently detectable, or potentially future detectable, gravitational signatures.  The irregularities in the CMB do indicate clumping of some sort, do they not?  I'm wondering if LIGO and it's successors will have a look back time farther than photon-based astronomy.
