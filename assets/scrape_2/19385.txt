What percentage of the hydrogen today has never been in a star

It stands to reason that some of the hydrogen and helium that formed directly as a product of the big bang might never have fallen into a star to re-ejected when that star explodes.  My question is, given the best theory, what percentage of that matter has managed to drift without being sucked into a star.  Do we have any idea?
