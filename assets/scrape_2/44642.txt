Can violet astronomical objects exist?

According to black-body radiation, violet stars are not possible.
Even if there are 1 million Kelvin, they are blue, not violet. But are violet galaxies, nebulae, clusters etc. possible?
Google found a violet galaxy or nebula or black hole, but it looked like it was just painted at will. Can violet astronomical objects actually exist?
Some nebulae containing oxygen are green. I'm looking for non black-body violet.
