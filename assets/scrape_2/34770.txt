Why does Newtonian physics give the right radius for a black hole?

When computing the distance at which the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light, the result is equal to the Schwarzschild radius. Is this just a coincidence, or is there a physical reason why the Newtonian approximation give the correct result?
If this is not a coincidence, then why is it OK to use Newtonian physics here?
