Time in 0 gravity points

If being close to a supermassive body like a black hole makes time pass more slowly for us than for an observer from a point of view with a weaker gravitational field, if we get to be at a point in space where there is no gravitational influence, would that make X time on earth a long time at that point?
I'm not talking about a Lagrangian point, where as I've studied, the field strengths cancel each other out. (I am a high school student from Spain).
If we could spend our lives at a point with this characteristic, would we be longer lived or would we still live ~85 earth years?
Has it been calculated what would be the time equivalence in such a place?
