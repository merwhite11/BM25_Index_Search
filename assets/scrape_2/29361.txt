Would drinking melted ice water from Mars taste like sparkling water?

Does water on Mars form from the atmosphere as ice free from salt?
Does water desalinize through the evaporation and transpiration?
When the fresh top ice is placed in a container then pressurized to melt, would the water be carbonated?
Particulates of salt and dust is less in the atmosphere during a Martian winter so would the ice that forms be also drinkably cleaner?
