Anti matter in Jupiter magnetic field?

My question is based in this Wikipedia article about the Jupiter magnetic field:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Jupiter
Jupiter magnetic field generates plasma and accelerates ionized molecules, eventually producing collisions. Is anti matter generated naturally under this scenario?
