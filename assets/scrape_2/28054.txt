What does the word "shock cooling" mean in supernova physics?

I cannot understand the meaning of "shock cooling" which occurred in supernova. 
And I saw the sentence like "Early photometry and spectroscopy reveal evidence of shock cooling of an extended helium-rich envelope". Could you explain the mechanism of shock cooling in supernova?
