How can a black hole ever form?

We know that an object falling to the black hole, as observed from an observer far away, will freeze as it gets closer and closer to the event horizon. So my question is how can a black hole form in the first place? I mean we usually say thing a star collapses into a blackhole. But considering the effect of "time-freezing", how could that be possible in the first place?
