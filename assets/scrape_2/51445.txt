About Year Zero

It is said that, in part due to a poor grasp of mathematics (the number zero to be precise) our forebears, when they developed the calendar went from 1 BC/BCE to 1 AD/CE. Year Zero is missing - it would've been, for Christians, the year Jesus Christ was born.
How do astronomers, the go-to-people when it comes to developing/maintaining/improving accurate calendars, have to say about this? If year 1 AD/CE is actually the year 0 AD/CE, does that mean this is 2021 AD and not 2022 AD?
I did a little reading on Wikipedia (it has a page on Year Zero) and it seems that astronomers have decided to treat year 1 BC/BCE as year 0 and if that's the case, this year, which is about to end in 5 days, is the year 2022. Astronomers don't use the BC/BCE or the AD/CE labels, instead preferring to use the mathematical signs - and + for them, respectively. This is of course mathematically very sound, but the problem is 1 BC (year zero) is an unremarkable year - nothing of global significance occurred in that year. Of note is the fact that there's no real consensus on the Jesus' birth year - the same source, a Dionysius Exiguus, gives conflicting dates (1 BC and 1 AD).
Is 1 BC (Year Zero) of astronomical significance - did something special (astronomically) happen that year?
