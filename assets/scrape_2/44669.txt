Are Brown and Sub-Brown Dwarfs secretly more common than stars?

I recently heard that Red Dwarfs are the most common type of star, and low-mass Red Dwarfs are the most common type of Red Dwarf.  This seems to imply a generic trend that the lower the mass, the more common the star.  I have 2 questions.

I know that Brown Dwarfs and Sub-Brown Dwarfs are much harder to detect because they are not very luminous.  Is it possible that Brown Dwarfs and Sub-Brown Dwarfs are actually even more common than Red Dwarfs?  Are there any theories or papers on this?

Is there a lower limit on the mass of an object that can be formed at the center of a gas/dust nebula collapse (as opposed to being formed in a protoplanetary disk)?
