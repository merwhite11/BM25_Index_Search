After Oumuamua passage, has an "urgency" telescope time request procedure been set up?

During the rapid passing of Ê»Oumuamua through our solar system, it was difficult to get instant telescope time. Usually, formal requests and a review process are necessary before telescope time is provided to a particular project.
Now everybody is excited and eager to observe more interstellar objects. Did "they" set up an appropriate request procedure for immediate telescope usage for that matter? Or can one expect that similar hurdles and paperwork are required when the next such object is discovered?
Is there any kind of international standard, or are such requests managed individually by each observatory?
