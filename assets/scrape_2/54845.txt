Formation of spacecraft instrumentation

List of spacecraft instruments are selected to meet a mission's science goals.

Let's take New Horizons as an example and study the composition of Pluto's atmosphere, the shape and geological structures of the surface, and the particles interacting with the atmosphere From here.

In this case, we will need: several types of spectrometers, a radiometer, photo and video cameras, a particle recorder and a soil sample collector.
When the list of what we need is ready, what do we do next? Do we “go, select and buy” ready-made devices with suitable characteristics or design/develop/create the necessary tools from scratch? And is it possible for the device to be used in a situation that was not previously foreseen (for example, when it is necessary to study CMB, but there are no direct instruments for this on board)?
