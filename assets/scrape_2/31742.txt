Have we measured or found evidence of a detectable origin point of the big bang?

Based on reading the wiki page of the big bang, a simple question with a probably not a simple answer came to mind.
The statement on the wikipedia page was.

Since Georges Lema√Ætre first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion.

My question is:  Have we measured or found evidence of a detectable origin point of the big bang?
