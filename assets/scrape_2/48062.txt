Will the James Webb Space Telescope need re-alignment of primary mirror segments?

I couldn't find an answer to this question.
James Webb Space Telescope will align primary mirror segments and secondary mirror in space.
Question is whether these will need re-alignment during the course of operation? And how often if so?
