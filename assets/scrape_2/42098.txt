Are the bright dots in this image individual stars?

I saw this picture of M51 (Whirlpool galaxy) and noticed many, many bright dots around and in the galaxy. I have freehand-circled a few as examples. Are these individual stars (probably supergiants) in the Whirlpool Galaxy, or are they clusters, stars in the Milky Way, or something else?
