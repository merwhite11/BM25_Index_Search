Any pictures showing difference in moon between southern and northern observers?

Since observers in different parts of Earth will be observing the moon at slightly different angles relative to its (choose reference vector: north pole, origin of latitude longitude position, whatever), they will be observing very slightly different faces of the moon.
I tried looking online to see if anyone had examples of photos of the moon taken from different parts of Earth at the same time but got overwhelmed of photos showing that the moon appears "upside down" in the southern hemisphere relative to what a northern observer would expect and couldn't find any.
Does anyone have or know where to find an example of what I'm asking?  Please note that I am not asking about the "upside down" moon effect I just described, and neither am I asking about lunar libration: I am specifically asking about being able to observe slightly different faces of the moon simply by standing somewhere else on Earth as someone else at the same time.
