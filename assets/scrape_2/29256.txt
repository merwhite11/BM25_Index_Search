Do clouds on earth have an affect on a blood moon to the naked eye?

I was watching the blood moon with a perfectly clear night- using only my naked eyes. At such a micro level, is it possible that all the shimmer I saw was an artefact of our atmosphere or just my poor eyes being the apeture? It basically had the look of a dark flame upon the moon- flickering.
My assumption was that the suns rays could be being attenuated through varied atmospheric densities causing a flickering effect. What is really happening?
Note... I wanted to observe it closer but snow and -9 degree weather prevented it. Bad to bring my telescope out in that. Also sorry for the shorthand. On mobile as well.
