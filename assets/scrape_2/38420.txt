can moon rise before sun and set after it in the same day

I found it mentioned in ancient Arabic astronomic book Kitāb al-Amwāl by Ibn Qutaybah (889 AD)

Cresent can't be seen in the morning in the east in front of the sun and in the evening i the west behind the sun in the same day


ولا يمكن  أن يرى الهلال بالغداة فى المشرق بين يدى الشمس، وبالعشىّ فى المغرب خلف الشمس فى يوم واحد.

Is this information valid for all locations and dates
Sun and Moon have very near orbits and both daily apparent motion (east-west) but moon has apparent retarding motion (west-east) could this retarding motion make the sun catch the moon in the first day of lunar month?
could this happen in normal (non polar) latitudes?
