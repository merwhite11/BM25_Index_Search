What came first: Galaxies or Stars?

In Stephen Hawking's A Brief History Of Time, the book mentions that "in regions that were slightly denser than average...galaxies were born." (pg 123). However, according to many other sources, the hypothesized Population III stars lived and died first, giving birth to black holes that would cause the formation of galaxies. So I am wondering, which statement is correct?
