What portion of all exo-planets can't be observed?

Exo-planets are usually observed by small decreases of the outgoing power of the stars accompanying them, when the planet passes between us and the star.
The orbits of the exo-planets lay in one plane. This means that only for a small amount of all possible planes the exo-planets will orbit the star in a way to become visible to us.
On the other hand, this gives the possibility to see more planets around the same star.
How big is, in theory, the portion of all stars that will show a characteristic planet signature? Do the observations agree with this number?
Can observations of exo-planets falsify the assumption that planetary planes are random or alligned. How else could this be verified?
In the second answer to the linked question it is written:

Thus, approximately 0.011Ã—0.866 =1% of the solar-like stars with planets should show Earth-size transits.

Does this mean that all orbits are assumed (and observed) to be parallel to the galactic plane?
