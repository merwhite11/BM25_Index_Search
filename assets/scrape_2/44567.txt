Are there only $10^{83}$ atoms in the universe?

I'm a high school junior. I assumed there would be an incredibly huge number of atoms in the universe if not infinite. Recently, I've come across a few articles which claim that scientists believe there are 1083 atoms in the universe. I'm not sure if I should believe in this, to me, this seems like a small number. In average, a human alone has 1027 atoms, so, it's kind of unconvincing to me that there's only 1083 atoms in the whole universe.
