What is the galaxy M87 doing these days?

The massive elliptical galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster is 53,490,000 light years away. It also contains one of the largest, heaviest supermassive black holes in the known Universe. But it's also my understanding that the stellar population of this galaxy is mostly old, red supergiants. Is there any evidence for new star formation in M87? If there isn't, what is the fate of this galaxy and what is it like in modern times? That may be impossible to know for sure but what I wonder is if the remaining stars and matter in the galaxy have been swallowed up by central black hole which may be thousands of lightyears across by now.
