How far away is this galaxy?

Arp 299 is in the news, with most sources reporting it as 140 or 150 million light-years away. But what kind of distance is this?
The paper which is trhe source for the news item has Supplementary Materials which mention the distance but don't appear to say what kind or give details:

The merging pair of galaxies Arp 299 (Fig. 1) at a 44.8 Mpc distance (33; corrected to the cosmic microwave background reference frame; H0 = 73 km s^-1 Mpc^-1) is one of the brightest nearby LIRGs with an IR luminosity LIR ~ 7x10^11 L_⊙ (34; L_⊙ = 3.833×10^26 W).

Is it obvious what method is used (and thus what type of distance this is) to measure the distance to this galaxy? Is there a standard reference/database/etc. giving basic information like distances of astronomical objects like galaxies? I'd like to know the answer for this galaxy, but answers that generalize will naturally be more interesting.

Edward L. Wright has a cosmology calculator that is useful in converting between different types of distances. His page on distances gives many methods for measuring distances; I feel that if I knew which type (if any) of these methods was used to find the distance I'd have a decent chance of figuring out what kind of distance it was (and could find the other distances by bisection).
