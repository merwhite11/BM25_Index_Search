How can black holes be sometimes so gaseous?

One of the most massive Supermassive Black Hole observed is the one at the centre of the galaxy NGC1600 with a mass of 17 billion suns. It would have a density of âˆ¼0.01kg/m^3, or one part in 100,000 times the density of water, or 1% the density of earth atmosphere at sea level.
But if there is so much gas why isn't the bh shrinking and becoming more dense as gravity would pull everything together?
