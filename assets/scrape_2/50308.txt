How can I identify if my stone is meteorite?

I found 2 stones in my village. One of them is magnet attractive, well-shaped, no bubbles etc. I just want to clarify if it is meteorite, but in my country (Azerbaijan) there's not such a lab. Is it possible to send a video of this stone to some foreign labs?
Here's the video links:
