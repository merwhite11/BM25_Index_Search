When will Jezero crater on Mars reach its lowest atmospheric pressure and what pressure will that be?

In the first sols of the Mars 2020 mission the local pressure was something above 750 Pa. It has been decaying since then and is now less than 650 Pa, this is what required Ingenuity's rotorblades to rotate faster than originally, for flying. I guess the decay is due to Mars coming closer to the Sun on its more elliptical orbit.
Currently Mars is about half-way between its ap- and perihelion, so if the distance from the Sun is the cause, there could be something around 550 Pa at Perseverance's site during perihelion. Would Ingenuity still be able to fly then? Will the pressure really fall below the triple point of water, and is it due to approaching the Sun? What pressure will eventually be reached and when, before starting to rise? Also, does this happen on the entire planet Mars (the atmosphere getting thinner and eventually thicker again) or are there places on Mars where the local atmospheric pressure is rather constant throughout the Martian year? Did other landers report such rapid pressure changes as well (disregarding a rover's own changing elevation in their course).
Edit: Alright, my question is essentially answered by this answer in Space Exploration from "Why not wait?" on.
