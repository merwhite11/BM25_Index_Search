Photographing Venus with a phone through a telescope


I took a picture of Venus through my telescope (Celestron Astromaster 130eq) using a 10mm lens with a Barlow lens.
The picture isn't really good since I took it with my phone and I still don't have a camera. 
Also, it isn't a matter of focus since I fiddled a lot with it.
I don't know what to do to clear the image and reduce the brightness. Should I use a filter? and which one?
