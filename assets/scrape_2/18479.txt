Can any radio telescope be hooked up with the Very Long Baseline Array, or other interferometers?

The Very Long Baseline Array uses both Arecibo and Spectr-R, the world's largest space telescope with 10 m diameter at Lunar distance, as well as many other antennas. Are there any particular requirements on the design for a radio telescope to be used interferometrically? Could for example the now operating Chinese Five Hundred meter Spherical Telescope be used as a part of the VLBA?
