Do some galaxies collide faster than the speed of light?

If some galaxies expand away from each other faster than the speed of light then do they collide faster than the speed of light?
Update 1:

I guess my question is what's the max speed/velocity at which galaxies can move towards each other?
How long does it take for galaxies to collide?

If you could use this example that would be awesome.
Galaxy A: diameter of 3,000 light years
Galaxy B: diameter of 300,000 light years
If Galaxy A collide with Galaxy B , what would be the velocity at the collision?
I have no idea about what the time and distance would be.
