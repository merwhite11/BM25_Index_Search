What does the word "compact" mean in astronomy/astrophysics?

I have seen countless times the adjective "compact" in astronomy, e.g. compact stars, compact binaries, etc. I would like to know, what exactly is this supposed to mean? From this source, I am led to believe that "compact" is meant to denote objects of the greatest matter densities in the universe, i.e. white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Is this correct?
