Why was the diaeresis removed from Pasiphae?

The Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature notes that the spelling of Jupiter's moon Pasiphae was changed from PasiphaÃ« in July 2009, i.e. they removed the diaeresis. I've been unable to track down the rationale for this decision. Is anyone aware of why the spelling was changed?
