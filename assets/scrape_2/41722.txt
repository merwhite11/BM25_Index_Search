What keeps galaxies together?

The super massive black hole at the centre of Milky Way has a mass of about 4 million times that of our sun. Is this enough to keep the entire galaxy together, is it this black hole which keeps the galaxy together? I did read that there are also galaxies that don't have a super massive blackhole, what keeps those galaxies together?
I did ask this question at space stackexchange but it got closed because it was posted at wrong place.
