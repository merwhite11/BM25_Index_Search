How much higher is the radiation around Jupiter than at Chernobyl, after the explosion?

I suppose the radiation levels are higher at Jupiter, but how much? Would the Juno probe have been able to "operate" on the Chernobyl roof in $12\,000\, {\rm Roentgen/hr}$?
After watching the short series Chernobyl, I was curious how the radiation levels compare with that around Jupiter (generally), and what the Juno probe in particular have to withstand, but I couldn't directly compare the numbers I found.
In the Chernobyl accident, the reactor explosion causes pieces of graphite to fall on the roofs of the reactor building, and they describe that they can't push them off with remote-control machines because the radiation damages the circuits.
In the series, the value given for the most dangerous roof is $12\,000\, {\rm Roentgen/hour}$.
The Juno probe's radiation vault is a titanium box with ${\rm 1.75cm}$ thick walls, and the article says

But this orbit would still expose an unprotected probe to a radiation
dose of more than 20 million rads [...] over the course of its mission.

The mission was planned for 14 Earth months but the probe only spends short periods of time around Jupiter.
Perhaps someone has an idea how to fill in the gaps and help to make a comparison.
