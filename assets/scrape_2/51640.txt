Half Moon illumination evening and morning

With a first quarter Moon I notice that in the evening the Moon is lit from the east and the following morning the opposite limb west is illuminated. I understand that my position has changed by 180 degrees in the 12 hours but surely that would not account for the change in appearance entirely as the suns position in relation to the Moon has not changed?
