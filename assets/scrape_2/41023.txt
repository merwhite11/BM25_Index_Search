Why can't we build a huge stationary optical telescope inside a depression similar to the FAST radio telescope?

So first we'll have to find a natural depression or we should create one. I understand you can only see a single portion of the sky since it can't be moved, so my money is on creating an artificial basin in an area where directly upwards it has the best view of the sky.
Imagine if we can build a 1000 m optical telescope like that. We'd be able to see exoplanets directly. We'd be able to see ancient galaxies. Even a 200 m one like this would do wonders. Are there any proposals?
