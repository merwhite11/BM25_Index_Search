What's this red stuff in some astronomical photos, e.g. Centaurus A?


Sorry for the rookie question, but I've got no idea about that red "belt" crossing over center of the galaxy, in this photo. I've actually tried all sorts of google searches but I couldn't get anywhere with keywords like "The red stuff" or so. Years ago I had a color book in which I saw this photo for the first time, and I can remember my attempt to remove the red dirt and clean the image with my shirt!
