What escape velocity would quark stars have?

Quark stars are hypothetical compact stars that are denser than neutron stars and maybe the last stage of upholding matter before stars that collapse into a singularity. Neutron stars have escape velocities up to half the speed of light, and the escape velocity of quark stars must be even closer to c. Could it be that some or all black holes are quark stars whose escape velocity is just above 1 c, rather than singularities?
