Is it easier to see the young moon when it's closer to the sun?

With the naked eye, would it be easier to see the moon when it's close to the sun, because it might reflect some more light (or not, I'm not sure) or farther from the sun because the sun shines brighter, same with how we can't see the stars?
Also, would it be easier to see it a few minutes after the sun sets and the moon is on the verge of setting, maybe at the +5Â° on the azimuthal grid?
