Why nobody cares to give the nearest stars better names?

The star occupying 6th place on Wikipedia's list of nearest stars and brown dwarfs can be called either Lalande 21185, BD+36 2147, Gliese 411 or HD 95735. That seems to me like a fine, quadruple choice of equally bad names. 
I mean, I know these come from positions held in various star catalogues and maybe aren't that bad compared to monstrosities like WISE J085510.83âˆ’071442.5, but can't we keep those for stars like 50 light yrs away and invent something better for our nearest neighbours?
This year we saw a batch of confirmations for planets orbiting in habitable zones of many of these stars. In not so distant future we may find ourselves discussing possibility of sending probes to some of these systems. Aren't better names long overdue?
