Movement of the stars relative to my position

I live in the Pacific North West (Washington State, US). I have watched the skies for years, looking for constellations that I recognize and keeping track of them. One of them is Orion. As I have watched Orion I noticed that it travels East to West as I look to the south. It traverses the line that is the Milkey Way... 
My question is. If the stars that make up the constellation of Orion move East to West from my position, looking up and South. Why does the Milky Way seem to stay in the same position? How is it that the stars that make up Orion move but the stars that make up the milky way appear to be fixed?
Thank you in advance for any input.
