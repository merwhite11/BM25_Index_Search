Is time finite or infinite?

I am not a scientist nor do I have a degree in Astrophysics, but I do like to learn new things by asking questions. With that being said, I have read that time is relative to space which began after the big bang. Moreover, before or right at the moment before the big bang, energy was confined to a very very small scale like the tip of the needle or something.
But, I wonder since energy can neither be created nor destroyed, that means energy is infinity with no beginning.
So, when it is said time started with the big bang, is that in reference to our universe? Because in reference to energy, shouldn't time be infinite too? Or time has to be relative to space as well and so there is no concept of time prior to the big bang?
