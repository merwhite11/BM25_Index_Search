We should be seeing more than 59% of the Moon

It is said that we see about 59% part of the Moon due to libration. However we must be seeing more than that. My logic is as below.
Since the Moon's orbit is inclined to the plane of Sun-Earth by 5 1/2 degree, when Moon is at farthest and lowest point below the plane, we can see beyond the North Pole of Moon from the Earth's North pole and similarly when the Moon is above the Sun-Earth plane we can see much beyond South pole of the Moon from Earth's South Pole.
Thus we must be seeing more than 59% due to inclined orbit of Moon.
