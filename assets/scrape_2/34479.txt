If an event occurs at a point in space time what will an observer experience first, it's gravity or the light from it?

Let's assume a person is close enough to an object in space time to be able to observe it's gravitational effects and the light coming from it.
If that object suddenly pops out of existence (hypothetical situation), what will the person observe first,

The gravitational field's absence
The object disappearing (light stops coming)

P.S.- pardon me for the noobness of this question, physics isn't one of my strongest subjects.
