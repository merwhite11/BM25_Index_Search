What would the effects on or around Earth if Betelgeuse went supernova?

There's been a lot of news lately about Betelgeuse possibly exploding sooner than perhaps was expected. Some examples:

What would the effects on Earth be if Betelgeuse were to explode within our lifetimes? 
Of course, this would be highly unlikely to happen during our lifetimes, but I'm curious what sorts of effects, if any, it might have on our planet (including our upper atmosphere). I imagine the effects would be measurable but negligible. 
I'm looking for imaginative but scientifically-based answers.
