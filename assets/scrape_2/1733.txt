Why haven't Earth and Venus got any tiny moons? Or have they?

Why haven't some meteoroids gotten caught in Earth's or Venus' orbit?
AFAIK most meteors are tiny fragments from comets. Shouldn't some comet tail sometime have passed Earth orbit at velocities suitable for our planet to capture such fragements? And 100 000s of asteroids have been detected. Why haven't the inner planets gotten asteroid like moons like the outer planets have? The asteroid belt isn't too far away.
Earth's large Luna might clean them away, but that won't explain Venus' lack of tiny moons.
