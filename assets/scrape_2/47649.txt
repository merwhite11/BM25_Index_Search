Can the Dark Matter / Energy problem be plausibly reframed as an ignorance of gravity problem?

I understand Dark Matter was originally proposed to explain the rotation rate of galaxies. The rate was not explained by observed matter, ergo there must be unobserved matter. An alternate explanation would be that the inverse square law is not the whole story over galactic distances.
A similar issue exists for Dark Energy. The universe is expanding faster than predicted by the total matter observed, ergo there must be a lot of energy out there. An alternative explanation would be incomplete  understanding of gravity at intergalactic distances.
