What is the process for vetting the 4,175 candidate planets Kepler has discovered?

In the National Geographic article about NASA's announcement of new planets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft, it states that there are 4,175 candidate planets. What is the process for vetting these candidate planets? How do we know they exist without knowing whether they are planets? Or are they candidates because the data hints that a planet might be there but we need more detailed data or more analysis before we can confirm it?
