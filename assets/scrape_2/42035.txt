If GRB 080319B happened next to nearest star: Proxima Centauri, what effect would that have had on us?

From a Reddit post 

GRB 080319B was a gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by
the Swift satellite at 06:12 UTC on March 19, 2008. The burst set a
new record for the farthest object that was observable with the naked
eye: it had a peak visual apparent magnitude of 5.7 and remained
visible to human eyes for approximately 30 seconds. The magnitude was
brighter than 9.0 for approximately 60 seconds. If viewed from
1 AU away, it would have had a peak apparent magnitude of −67.57 (21
quadrillion times brighter than the Sun seen from Earth).

Someone asked what would happen if that GRB happened from the distance of  Proxima Centauri, what effect would that have had on us?
