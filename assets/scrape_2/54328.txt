Is there such a thing as a map that shows the current (not observed) positions of celestial objects?

As I understand it, maps of the sky and three-dimensional maps of the universe all show the observed positions of celestial objects.
Are there any maps that show our best guess at their current positions? Does such a thing have a name? Is it even possible?
