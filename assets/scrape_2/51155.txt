How could we detect if Venus or mars were being terraformed by aliens?

If any other body in our solar system was being terraformed by aliens, what would be the ways in which we would detect this?
Initially I thought of Venus or mars but I guess this could extend to any body within the solar system.
What would be the first signs? Who would be the people that would actually start detecting changes?
