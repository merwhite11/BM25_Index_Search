How are we identifying chemicals in space?

How do we identify chemicals in space?   For example, how did we find the cloud of methyl alcohol (aka methanol) in W3 (OH) which is 6500 light years away.  I can understand a scope being able to tell something is there, but I don't see how they determine that it is not only alcohol but the type of alcohol.
Here is a link to the W3(OH):  https://phys.org/news/2014-09-alcohol-clouds-space.html
But I am looking for a general answer - as to how we identify chemicals, any chemicals, in space.
