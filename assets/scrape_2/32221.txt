Custom telescope

I am currently trying to make a Keplerian telescope from "scratch" with plano-convex lenses bought online. 

I have found my objective and eyepiece lenses. I'm just not sure if they will suffice to observe Mars with detail, I'm especially doubting my eyepiece choice because of the lens' diameter. Here are my lenses:
-Objective: 
-Eyepiece: 
So if there's any other lenses combo that you could recommend that aren't too pricey (~300$CAD) that could make observing Mars possible, that would be wonderful!!
