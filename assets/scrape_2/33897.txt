Based off of the study that found the universe has a positive curvature, how big would the whole universe be?

This study found that the universe has a positive curvature https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0906-9. I didn't really want to buy it and see if it says how big the universe might be. I know it didn't have a low enough p-value to be considered confirmed. Is there a big margin of error for the whole size of the universe?
