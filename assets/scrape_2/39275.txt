How far away are objects whose light will never reach us, because of the expansion of the universe?

I thought I had read this question on Stack Exchange before, but now I cannot find it...   In fact, I thought I had posted this question before, somewhere, on Stack Exchange...
I believe the answer was about 62 billion light years...
In other words, if an object is currently 62 billion light years away, or more, the light it is emitting right now will never reach Earth...
Is there a term for this 'line' or 'sphere'?
