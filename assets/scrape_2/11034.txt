What was the orbit of the meteor that impacted the Moon on 2013 September 11?

On 2013 September 11th, a meteor impacted the Moon leaving a 34-meter crater. So far the only info I've found was from youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCFDkj2JtyA) and this site: http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/810
I'm surprised this doesn't have its own wikipedia article (none that I could find, anyway), and google wasn't helpful either. Is the astronomical world more or less oblivious to this event?
Anyway, the data I'm most interested in is the meteor's orbital trajectory. And also, why would such a small meteor leave a "fireball" for 8 seconds according to the youtube video.
