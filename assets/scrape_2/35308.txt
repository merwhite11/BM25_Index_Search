Why do all the stars near this comet show up as four separate dots in a row?

After seeing this tweet about our not-so-new but at least newly-discovered "mini-moon" I scrolled down and saw the tweeted image below. 
Since the object is the known short-period comet 114P/Wisemanâ€“Skiff I'm guessing that the telescope guiding could have been pre-calculated and continuous, and yet the stars appear as four discrete and equally-spaced compact spots instead of continuous streaks.
Writing in the image says 2020 Jan 18.22 and 4x30s
What might be the explanation and reason for this?
Could these be stacked images resulting from a clever night of observing, perhaps bouncing back and forth between multiple objects so that each can be observed over an extended period of time?
Or do the four discrete spots per star allow for better astrometry than one long streak?
Or both? Or neither?
