What are the metrics of observation conditions?

How do professional astronomers measure and describe (ambient) observation conditions?
I know smog, light contamination from the city lights, fog, clouds, rain/snow, humidity etc all contribute negatively to quality of the image, obscuring the celestial objects more or less, but I'm fairly sure there is a more precise measurements of viewing capability for any given location or time than "good weather and far from cities" or "Kinda can see M42 in Orion if you squint."
