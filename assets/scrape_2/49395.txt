What do the flux letters mean? (U, B, V, R, I, G, J, H, K, u, g, r, i, z)

For any object on Simbad so lets take a random one,
http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=ton%20618  (Ton 618)
I'm trying to get a layman's explanation of Flux.
What do the letters stand for,
Does V stand for Visual and is it therefore the Apparent Magnitude of the object?  I see some pages on wikipedia saying "Apparent Magnitude (v)" and seemingly refer to the value in the Simbad page.
I look up in Google e.g. "Flux Filter-name" and don't get an explanation.
