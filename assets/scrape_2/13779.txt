Could gravity waves be used to confirm the existence of a ninth planet?

Shortly after the news of the discovery of gravity waves, my physics professor explained the significance of the discovery by comparing it to a medical X-ray machine. He said that gravity waves can be used to detect objects that cannot be seen using telescopes. Therefore, could gravity wave detectors be used to confirm the existence of the theorized ninth planet? Even though it doesn't have a high enough albedo to be seen, it would still be detectable gravitationally, wouldn't it?
