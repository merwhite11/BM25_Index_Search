Does anyone have spectra on exoplanet HD 219134b? How could one know either way?

I have foraged through the internet to no avail.
Is there a way to systematically check if spectra from a given exoplanet has been reported, like a catalog or list of references, or is a literature search using likely keywords the only way to look into this? Thanks!
