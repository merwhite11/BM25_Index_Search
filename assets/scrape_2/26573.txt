Can aliens possibly be around us?

I've heard somewhere that when we observe distant galaxies, we actually look into the past. For example, if a planet is 3 million light years away from us, it means that we observe its state as it was 3 million years ago, am I right?
So, I think this explains why we haven't encountered any aliens yet. Because we see their planets in their ancient times, their civilizations haven't formed yet. So we think that nobody's around us. But instead we can actually be surrounded by alien civilizations.
Is this idea plausible?
