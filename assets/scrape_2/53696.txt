Creating a small data pipeline

I wanted to create a small data pipeline such that it consists of images of sky in the filters  F125W, F160W, F606W and F850LP. The 4 images for a single object should be in a single FITS File which is later to be used for analysis purposes. An example of what I want this data pipeline to resemble could be found here1
Can anyone please outline a way for me to do this ?
