Are there any estimates of the Roche Limit for 152830 Dinkinesh?

The Lucy spacecraft recently flew past the asteroid 152830 Dinkinesh on its way through the asteroid belt and photos show that Dinkinesh has a moon consisting of a contact binary.

From Wikipedia:

The Roche limit, also called Roche radius, is the distance from a
celestial body within which a second celestial body, held together
only by its own force of gravity, will disintegrate because the first
body's tidal forces exceed the second body's self-gravitation.
Inside the Roche limit, orbiting material disperses and forms rings,
whereas outside the limit, material tends to coalesce. The Roche
radius depends on the radius of the first body and on the ratio of the
bodies' densities.

The estimated diameter of Dinkinesh is 790 metres but I haven't seen any estimates of the orbital distance of the moon, or of the densities of these bodies.  Given that the fly-by is so recent, and the moon hasn't even been named yet, are there any estimates of the Roche Limit of Dinkinesh?
