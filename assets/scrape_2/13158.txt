What if we throw two solid objects parallel in space? Do those two objects have any chance to collide with each other?

What will happen if just throw two solid objects (for example, solid footballs) parallel in outer space and those two objects are floating and going far away in the universe.
So is there any possibility in which those two football-size solid objects can collide with each other, or will they will float parallel for an infinite amount of time in the universe?
I'm considering gravity also, and I find that other stars's and planets's
gravitational pull can pull them into their gravitational fields and change their direction.
But what if those two objects will never get destroyed by luck? Could those will collide each other?
