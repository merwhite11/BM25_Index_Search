How can heavy elements exist when the universe is young compared to the lifetime of a star?

Our sun is said to be incapable of producing heavier elements, and these are thought to originate from older stars dying and going supernova. If our sun is 4-5 billion years old, and has a lifetime of 10 billion years, how could an earlier sun have lived and died in the short time between the creation of the universe and the birth of our fine solar system?
