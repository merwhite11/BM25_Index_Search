Greenhouse effect on planets

Venus has a greenhouse affect because its atmosphere is 96 percent carbon dioxide. However, although mercury is closer to the sun it does not have the greenhouse effect because it has no atmosphere and only an exosphere. I was wondering why doesn't mars have a greenhouse effect like Venus? They both have around 95 percent carbon dioxide in their atmosphere and consist of an atmosphere. In addition, I was also wondering about what are the requirements to have a greenhouse effect on a planet?
