What are the aspects does the moon differs between cities located on the same latitude?

What are the aspects does the moon (astronomical position and other astronomical aspects) differs between cities located in the same latitude? - For example: Seattle, Munich, Vienna, and Ulaanbaator are on the same line,
If there are four persons see the night sky at the same time: the sky view (constellations) will be the same because they all on the same latitude; but Does the moon position and movement and the time of rise and set, will be exactly the same?

Could using ephemeris of the moon calendar (Ascension, declination, culm, Constellation ...etc) help to know the differences? and Which aspect is the most obvious one?
