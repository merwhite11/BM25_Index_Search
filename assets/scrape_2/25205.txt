Why are tides high only on a full moon day?

As far as I've known, sea tides are higher on a Full moon day. And that is due to the "gravitational pull" of the moon.
But we know that moon is visible because of reflection of sun's rays. So, even on a new moon's day, the moon is still there, but it's not visible.
So, why doesn't it affect the gravity on earth?
Thanks in advance.
