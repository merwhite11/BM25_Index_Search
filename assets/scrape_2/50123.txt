What physical process can Metallicity(Z) of a galaxy tell us?

For example, if there is a galaxy and its metallicity increase or decrease from high redshift to present day (We can see it from simulation like TNG or EAGLE). What physical process we can know?
Metallicity defined as (Mz/Mtot, where Z = any element above He)
My answer is that if metallicity of a galaxy increase, that means this galaxy is star-forming because new stars are thought to be with higher metallicity. I don't know if it is right.
