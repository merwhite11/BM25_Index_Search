What rotational speed would Mercury need to have to achieve a temperature comfortable for humans

I wondered what rotational speed would Mercury need to have to achieve a temperature comfortable to humans, let's say 20 Â°C.
EDIT:
My idea was that if Mercury is so cold on the night side and so hot in the daylight then if it rotates fast enough maybe it can reach normal temperatures. But now I understand why this cannot be possible.
