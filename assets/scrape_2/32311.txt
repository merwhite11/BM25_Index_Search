Why do things float in space, though the gravity of our star is always present?

In the solar system, things float around. We are so certain that the gravity of our sun exists. Still, why does that gravity not influence satellites and other objects there?
Our solar system is also orbiting the center of our galaxy, and the gravity of our black hole, but still many objects float around. I wonder why.
