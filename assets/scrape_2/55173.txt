Could the Methuselah star be evidence that there was a universe before this one?

If the Methuselah star proved to be older than the universe could it be from a previous big bang big crunch cycle in which not everything was crunched? What would be the smallest radius the universe could have  without the temperature getting so high that Methusala would be completely ionized and destroyed by a crunch?
