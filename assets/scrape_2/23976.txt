Will all of the gas in the universe be converted into red dwarf stars?

Red dwarfs have lifespans of trillions of years and are also the most abundant stars, making up 70% of the stars in the Milky Way. No red dwarf star has ever died and none will die for a very, very long time. Because it take so long for them to die, they're not releasing their hydrogen back into the interstellar medium to make new stars.
As more massive stars live and die over the course of years, those stars release their hydrogen into the interstellar medium, which can form new stars, 70% of which will be red dwarfs. Does this mean that, billions of years into the future, all of the matter will get locked within red dwarfs until they begin dying out trillions of years later?
