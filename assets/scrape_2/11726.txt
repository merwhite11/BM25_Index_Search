Does the universe expand at the same rate everywhere in the universe?

Specifically, I am wondering if some areas of the universe expand faster than other areas and whether the faster expanding areas diffuse the expansion through the slower expanding areas or does the expansion occur at a uniform rate throughout the entire universe.
