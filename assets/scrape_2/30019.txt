What's the soonest Oumuamua could return?

Oumuamua is apparently a cigar-shaped asteroid that recently passed through the solar system on an unusual orbit, exhibiting unexpected acceleration.
Oumuamua is known to have fairly minimal powers of thrust other than gravitational free fall, insufficient in themselves to quickly turn around and accelerate the body, but they could be sufficient to enable it to influence itself to harness the gravitational effects of surrounding planetary bodies.  Assuming favourable thrust conditions, what is the soonest we could expect it to return?
*The extragravitational thrust is of unknown cause.  The most popular explanation is that Oumuamua has some cometary properties and that it is caused by cometary outgassing in proximity to the Sun, although no cometary tail is apparent.
