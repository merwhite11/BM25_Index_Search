Are the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system so close that inhabitants on one planet could see surface details on the other planets?

In a discussion below the Space Exploration question Are there any to-scale diagrams of the TRAPPIST-1 system I was invited to ask a question like this, so I have.
Question: Are the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system so close that inhabitants on one planet could see surface details on the other planets? How big would each planet appear from each of the other planets during conjunction or opposition? Bigger than Earth's moon?
