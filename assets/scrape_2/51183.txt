Is there a term for a Venus visibility period

Is there a term for the period of time when Venus is first visible in the evening to when it switches to being the "morning star", or vice versa?  For example, as depicted in the image below, from Early Oct 2022 to late July 2023, Venus will be visible in the evening.
I know the Mayans took a particular interest in the 8 different patterns produced (for where they were), but never found a word they used for the patterns, nor the time periods they represent.  I'm not looking for a Mayan word specifically, just anything other than "the time when Venus is visible in the evening/morning this time around".
