is weight of two identical objects same when they have the same exact distance from earth's surface but one is on a mountain and the other on a plane?

Is the weight of two identical objects the same when they have the same exact distance from the earth's surface but one is on a mountain and the other on a plane?
The distance between the plane and the earth's surface contains only air.
Anyway can anyone test this? I have seen some documentaries where they test the weight of the same person in different heights always on a hill or mountain but I have not seen anyone doing what I ask above. When that is tested, are there any data worth observing?
