What is the average color of the universe?

Our Earth, being a beautiful blue orb, has an overall perceived wavelength of somewhere near 470 nm, that being the wavelength of light blue, because the oceans play an enormous role in the weighted average of all of the Earth's colors.
But what about the whole universe? The Earth is nothing in comparison to the host of multicolored stars, ranging from deep red to fiery blue. Taking into consideration the number of stars and each separate color's weighted average,  could we calculate the average color of the universe?
