Why did this meteor appear cyan?

A meteor recently flashed over Queenland.
The meteor has been described by various people as appearing cyan or aqua, so the blueness of the image can't be due to a camera issue. The colour doesn't appear to be anything found along the black body spectrum either.
What (chemical/physical process) would cause this meteor to appear cyan?
