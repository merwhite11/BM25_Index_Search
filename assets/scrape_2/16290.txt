How many actual stars are Polaris?

I am getting conflicting accounts everywhere. I heard astronomers saying Polaris is a 3-star system. Some say they are binary but are optical-doubled with a 3rd.
Phil Plait a renowned astronomer wrote in his book Bad Astronomy that Polaris is sextuple star system. 

The above text reads 

... but due to its proximity to the NCP it has taken on the popular name of Polaris. The star itself is actually rather interesting; it's really a multiple star consisting of at least six stars in orbit around each other.

While in his Crash Course Astronomy Series He said Polaris was a Pentuple star system.
Now, I am not saying Phil is doing anything wrong. I am actually a fan of him, enjoyed reading the books he authored. He may have said one or the other by mistake. I tried asking him this question, it does not look like there is an effective way to submit him an Errata or ask him questions like these.
So my question is, how many stars are Polaris and are they all gravitationally bound to each other or some of them are just Optically grouped?
