Where do new stars get their hydrogen from?

When stars run out of hydrogen, they explode (though they also use heavier elements for some time) and form nebulae. In the nebulae, new stars are born which use hydrogen as their fuel.
So, my question is from where do these new stars get hydrogen for their fuel?
