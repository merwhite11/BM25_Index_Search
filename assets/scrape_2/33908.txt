Could different views of the universe simply be different points in time?

I'm not sure if this is the correct stackexchange site for this question.
I've been reading this article on Vice Motherboard Thereâ€™s Growing Evidence That the Universe Is Connected by Giant Structures which while admittedly simplified for simpler folk like me put me wondering:
Is it at all possible that when we look out in to the distant universe in one direction, we are seeing the same galaxies and stars at a different point in time than if we look out in another direction? Could this occur if the distant body is moving laterally at a fast enough velocity relative to our position, or if the shape of the universe itself loops around?
Or is this not a proper interpretation of current theories of cosmology?
