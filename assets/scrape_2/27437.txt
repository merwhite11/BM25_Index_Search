Would this effect occur if an ice planet was put into orbit or trajectory?

Imagine an earth getting warmer. Humans decide to make their homes ready for a voluntary ice age. All the space agencies work together to get an icy planet/moon into our orbit between us and the sun.
My theory is that because the sun is heating up the ice and blowing it in the direction of earth, it'll make the Earth colder.
That final part is my question: Could ice molten in space eventually reach earth and perhaps be pushed in that direction by its heat?? Not taking into account whether or not it would benefit the earth.
I'm an amateur with no knowledge of physics, chemistry and astrology and want to learn answers to my questions.
Thanks in advance!
