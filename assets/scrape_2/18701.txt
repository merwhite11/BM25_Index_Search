Calculate eccentricity with altitude and semiminor axes

Following on from this question, I wish to know how to find the reverse - how to find eccentricity given a Semi-minor axis & altitude. 
I want to use something based on
$$b=a\sqrt{1âˆ’e^2}$$
but I have no real way to solve for $e$, for I do not trust my answer,
$$e=a\sqrt{1}-b$$
could anyone please help?
