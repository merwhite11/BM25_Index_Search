Which direction do the constellation revolve in?

If I am standing looking towards the East from the Northern Hemisphere, do the constellations appear to rotate towards the West via the North or the West via the South or am I completely off target all together? 
Why do we say Capricorn is in December at the Solstice? Where do we see it in the sky in the Northern Hemisphere in December and likewise would we see Aquarius in that same position in February etc..?
