How is phase defined in a binary orbit with eccentricity?

Are orbital phases of the black spot in the figure measured from some angle or time/period?
Usually, how is phase=0 defined? It is relative to the line of apses perhaps with phase=0 at periastron?
Any of the anomalies below is defined as orbital phase? Please specify reference papers or books.
E: eccentric anomaly
M: mean anomaly
u: true anomaly
