Which planets, nebula, and other objects can be seen using Celestron Astromaster 130EQ

I have got a Celestron Astromaster 130EQ telescope, which lens should I use to see the various planets and nebula? 
When I tried to see Mars it was only a small red dot on scope. 
As per the technical description, it's got 6" mirror with 650 mm focal length.
Kindly guide me to which lens of what mm should be used to see Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, and nebula.
