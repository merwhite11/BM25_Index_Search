Gas mass and velocity in galaxy

I was going through the SPARC data on galaxies (http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/)
The velocity of gas in the SPARC data is in http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/MassModels_Lelli2016c.mrt
The gas velocity seems to be different from the observed rotational velocity of the stars.
Does it mean that the gas and the stars are rotating at different velocities around the galaxy's center?
What does HI data actually measure? The velocity of atomic hydrogen?

In, astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/BTFR_Lelli2019.mrt, column 6 gives Vf and column 12 gives Vmax. This I am comparing with column 6 (Vgas) in astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/MassModels_Lelli2016c.mrt
