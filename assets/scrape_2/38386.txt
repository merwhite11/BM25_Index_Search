How much does the sky change in a few thousand years?

The "fixed stars" are not actually fixed, the earth's tilt changes over time etc., but all that happens slowly on human timescales.
Imagine a Babylonian astronomer (or astrologist?) teleported to the present, e.g. to present-day Iraq. Would she be able to tell that the sky is different? If so, what about a Maya  astronomer? In other words, how long does it take until the changes in the sky are perceptible to the human eye?
