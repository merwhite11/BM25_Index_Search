If the ratio of actual total mass to critical mass (Î©) in the universe is only about 0.3, why do cosmologists believe it is flat, as far as we see?

What about astronomical observations makes scientists believe our universe is flat, at least as far as they can tell?  Despite the critical Friedmann density being less than one, plus the existence of dark energy, etc.?
