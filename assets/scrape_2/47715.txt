Repetition of orbital structure on many scales - what is it called?

I'm certainly not the first to notice this, but there is a commonality between the structures of objects in space at different levels of magnification.  For instance...
The moon orbits earth...
The earth orbits the sun...
Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way...
Etc. Etc. ad infinitum
There seems to be a repetition of this arrangement where there is one object (or a cluster of objects) at a center, and then others orbit around it.  The repetition repeats on the micro scale as well (cells, atoms) but that's beyond the scope of astronomy SE.
I want to learn more, but don't know where to start.  Is there a name for this phenomenon?
