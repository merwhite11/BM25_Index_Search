If the James Webb Telescope finds galaxies beyond 14 billion light-years, will the astrophysicist establishment modify their theories?

It seems inevitable to me that the scope will indeed image them. If so, will the astonishingly inflexible astrophysicist establishment have the humility to admit they're wrong, and that the Big Bang theory is incorrect?
Or will there be a flurry of hand waving?
Thank you.
