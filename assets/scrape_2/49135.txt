How could low-gravity dust in the early solar system have formed hard stones?

I wonder how very low-gravity dust could make bind together and make hard and dense stones that later on will merge together and make some of the planets? I read some meteorites as hard as a hard stone are remnants of the early phase of solar system's formation. If this is the case, it shows that they are formed using their own gravity attracting other dust; however, I thought making such a hard stone will require a high pressure.
