Planetary gas giants

I've read that a gas giant, like Jupiter, doesn't have a rocky surface. But planets must start as a rocky conglomerate of flotsam. 

Is the interior so hot that all the material is molten and there is not a crust?  
Does the atmosphere creates enough pressure to create a supercritical fluid?   

What is the situation on Jupiter?
