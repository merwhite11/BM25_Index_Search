Is there a standard mapping of symbols to terms for celestial and orbital mechanics

Is there a standard mapping of symbols to terms for celestial and orbital mechanics (and physics in general)?
For example here are some ambiguities
Angular Momentum: L, H, J, $\Gamma$,
Orbital period: T or P,
M: mean anomaly or mass of the Sun,
E: energy or eccentric anomaly,
p: linear momentum or length of semi-latus rectum,
a: acceleration or length of semi-major axis,
e: eccentricity or base of natural logarithms,
