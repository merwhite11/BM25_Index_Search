How big can a crater get?

What is the biggest possible crater from an asteroid impact? Not asking for the biggest existing crater in the solar system. I should be able to find plenty of lists online. What I'm curious about is how big a crater can form before the impact results in both bodies reforming destroying near all evidence of the crater itself. 
I don't mind erosion or normal geological processes  destroying the craters. That is just a matter of time. 
Eg when the Mars size object hit the Earth. Both were substantially altered and incorporated in each other. Earth experienced a near complete reformation (in the spherical sense). Also resulted in the moon's formation. Obviously that sort of impact doesn't leave an 'obvious' crater.
I assume the makeup (mineral, size, speed, angle of impact etc) of both bodies will change the answer, so maybe a just a short list of sizes for the various xommon combinations?
Eg what would be the biggest crater possible on Earth before the Earth experienced severe...Um, reshaping?
