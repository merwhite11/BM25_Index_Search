How can it be known that Venus does not have plate tectonics?

This answer provides some insight into Venus' surface geology:

Water may be necessary as a lubricant for plate tectonics. Whether or not this is the case, Venus does not have plate tectonics. It instead has a stagnant lid geology, punctured occasionally by extreme vulcanism (Siberian traps level vulcanism, and then some).

What are the observations that lead to this conclusion? The existence of plate tectonics on Earth was first determined by putting a lot of pieces of the first-hand observational puzzle together. There's much less data available from Venus.
