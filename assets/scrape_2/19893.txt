Is it possible to figure out your location in the Milky Way if you are suddenly wormholed to a random, distant location in the galaxy?

If you were flying along in your spacecraft somewhere in our solar system and then a large, stable wormhole suddenly opened and you flew into it and were whisked away to some distant location in the galaxy, would you be able to figure out where you were? 
Obviously, a large stable wormhole is exceedingly unlikely, and then there's the matter of the power of your onboard computer and telescope(s). But all that aside, I'm wondering if it would be even theoretically possible to figure out where you were, since the constellations would probably be unrecognizable and you wouldn't have an understandable flight path.
