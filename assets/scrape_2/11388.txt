What does Stephen Hawking mean by 'an infinite universe'?

In the recent $100m search for extra terrestrial life project project, Stephen Hawking is quoted in the following way:

"We believe that life arose spontaneously on Earth," Hawking said at Monday's news conference, "So in an infinite universe, there must be other occurrences of life."

My understanding is that scientists believe that the universe isn't infinite - there there is a finite number of stars, it's continuously expanding but has a finite size at a given time. 
What's Stephen Hawking refering to here?
