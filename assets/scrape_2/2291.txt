Will a new planet form if Jupiter's influence on asteroid belt will diminish in a few billion years?

I know that tidal forces are pushing Jupiter farther from the Sun, but I couldn't find exactly the yearly amount. In a few billion years would this effect (and subsequent decrease in gravity pull) allow the formation of a new planet from the asteroid belt or would Jupiter take the asteroids with it farther away?
