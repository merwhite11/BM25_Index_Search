Simulation packages or theory to work with gravitational collapse of massive molecular clouds?

So, I am getting interested in gravitational collapse of large molecular clouds that fragment and collapse into multiple stars. Are there well-known popular academic simulation packages that simulate these, for research purposes? Or are there papers or references I can use to write my own?
