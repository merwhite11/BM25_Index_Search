Has the small meteorite that hit Webb done a lot of damage?

I read on the web about Webb:

A tiny meteoroid struck the newly deployed James Webb Space Telescope in May, knocking one of its gold-plated mirrors out of alignment but not changing the orbiting observatory's schedule to become fully operational shortly, NASA said on Wednesday

How seriously must we take this?
