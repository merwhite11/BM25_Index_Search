Temperature of the intracluster medium (ICM)

I've read once in an article that the temperature of the medium within galaxy clusters (the intracluster medium or ICM) is extremely high. 

What does that temperature really mean? Particle velocity? 
Why is that so?
Is that medium the "Void"? 
Is it in conflict with the CMB temperature (that's about 3 K)?
