What does it mean for something to be optically thick to pair production?

I have seen several references in the high energy astrophysics literature (including the example below) which make reference to an astronomical source being "thick to pair production".
What does this mean? Why would something be thick to pair production?

from Broderick and Tchekhovskoy (2015) Horizon-Scale Lepton Acceleration in Jets: Explaining the Compact Radio Emission in M87:

4.3. Post-Gap Cascade
Given the threshold seed photon energy of 1.2 meV, the minimum gamma-ray energy for which the seed photons bath is optically-thick to pair production is $\epsilon_{\gamma, min}$ = 640 GeV, hence the asymptotic Lorentz factor for M87 is (see Equation 27)
$$\gamma_{\gamma \gamma} = 2.6 \times 10^6, \tag{59}$$
implying enhancement in the number density due to the postgap cascade of roughly $n_{\infty} / n_g$ = 670 (see Equation 28).
