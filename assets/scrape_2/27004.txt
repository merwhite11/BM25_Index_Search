Why does in-the-sky.org say that Mercury is not visible from Taipei these days?

I know that viewing Mercury is a challenge, but I'm fairly close to the equator and Mercury was at greatest elongation just a week ago.
In-the-sky.org says:

All around the world, Mercury is visible as an evening object, having recently passed greatest elongation east. From Taipei, however, it is not observable – it will reach its highest point in the sky during daytime and is no higher than 10° above the horizon at dusk.
12 Jul 2018, 12:00 CST   –  Mercury at greatest elongation east
27 Aug 2018, 05:48 CST   –  Mercury at greatest elongation west
06 Nov 2018, 22:59 CST   –  Mercury at greatest elongation east
15 Dec 2018, 23:17 CST   –  Mercury at greatest elongation west

Of course, since Mercury stays near the Sun it will always reach its highest point in the sky during daytime, probably around lunchtime!
But I don't understand why it would be viewable all around the world (presumably just after sunset since it is currently near maximum elongation East), but not from Taipei.
