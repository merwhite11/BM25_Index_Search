What would be the highest possible naked-eye apparent magnitude?

What would be the highest possible magnitude $m$ of some star that could be viewed with a naked-eye? I am acquainted with this question, but mine is about the ideal conditions.
In order to achieve maximum possible efficiency, I would suggest these points to be considered:

Find (or better, construct) a monochromatic star with the peak wavelength at the maximum of the human perception ability (in order to avoid bolometric correction and ensure maximum efficiency).
Find the most experienced astronomer possible with extraordinary viewing abilities.
Place him out of the atmosphere, therefore in the middle of nowhere (just an astronomer and a star of magnitude $m$).
Let him use the averted vision technique.

Do you suggest any other points that should be considered? What is then the maximum possible magnitude $m$?
