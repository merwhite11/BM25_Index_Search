Does coronal mass ejection include radiation at optical wavelengths?

It is known that during Solar/Stellar Flare, plasma from the corona of the star is released into the space, and travels comparatively slowly. 
In an hypothetical situation, does the coronal mass also consist of electromagnetic radiation within the optical wavelengths? And if so, is it possible to observe the incoming coronal mass ejection from the ground/surface of the Earth way before it approaches?
