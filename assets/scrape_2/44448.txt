Why do sunspot rise in number "precisely" every eleven years?

Every eleven years (more or less precisely) sunspots are seen to rise in numbers. The magnetic field of the sun changes polarity over eleven years and this is the reason the number of spots can vary. But I'm not sure I understand why a flip occurs. On Earth, this can be seen at times too, but only at a longer time scale. Is this difference due to the sun being gaseous rather than liquid? Why is the periodicity so steady? Why does the flip occur in the first place? It surely has to do with the sun's rotation, but I don't see clearly how.
