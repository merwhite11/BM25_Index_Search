Is it possible for the year to have 11 full moons (i.e. the opposite of a blue moon)

A blue moon is so called for when we have 13 full moons in a year.

Is it possible to have 11 fun moons in a year? (Maybe if we included calendar changes, for example the start of the Gregorian calendar, this would be more likely)
If this is possible, what is this phenomenon called, and how rare are these years?
