Unknown objects on a time-lapse video of the starry sky

This is a random timelapse video of the starry sky https://dzen.ru/video/watch/638872052b36453f40e45ada?t=3.
Throughout the film, many luminous objects are seen moving across the sky.
I have seen similar videos before several times, this phenomenon is not unique.
Most objects move along a horizontal path, but some maneuver, disappear, or move almost vertically.
I have not found a satisfactory explanation of what it could be.
The simplest explanation is airplanes.
But the trajectory of some objects excludes this version, planes do not fly like that. None of the objects leave a trail of condensation behind them.
It can't be satellites, as satellites can't fly in random directions or maneuver. According to visual assessment, the height of the flight of objects seems to be small, within the lower atmosphere.
Objects cannot be meteorites because meteorites cannot move parallel to the earth, from horizon to horizon.
What is it?
