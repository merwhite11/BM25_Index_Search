Warm jupiter vs hot jupiter, fluffyness

If Jupiter was orbiting at 1AU, replacing Earth, but everything else in the solar system remained as it is currently, how much would the increased heat from the sun increase Jupiter's radius?
In other words, how much would Jupiter fluff up if it was closer to the sun?
Would that be close enough to classify it as a warm jupiter, or hot jupiter?  or would it still just be a standard jovian planet?
