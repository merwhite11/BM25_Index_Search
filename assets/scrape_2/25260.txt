Can you simulate artificial gravity by using an electromagnetic field?

If you create a electromagnetic field under a surface could you then create artificial gravity effect by wearing magnetized clothing and shoes? 
Or could you bombard objects that you want to experience gravitational forces with artificial gravitons or graviolis? Or inject or drink a ferrofluid (non-toxic) like that used in rocket fuel? 

A ferrofluid (portmanteau of ferromagnetic and fluid) is a liquid that
  becomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field. A
  grinding process for ferrofluid was invented in 1963 by NASA's Steve
  Papell as a liquid rocket fuel that could be drawn toward a pump inlet
  in a weightless environment by applying a magnetic field.

What I mean is create the forces of attraction and then make the objects you want to attract attractive, obviously.
This is as opposed to using other methods such as acceleration or centrifugal or centripetal force (or in addition to it).
