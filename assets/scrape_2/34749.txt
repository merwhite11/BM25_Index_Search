Are Tharsis Montes and Hellas Basin a result of the same event?

Looking at Mars map:

the highest, biggest mountains and their associated highlands are essentially antipodes of the deepest, huge basin. Roughly 180 degrees away, similar latitude except opposite sides of equator... this immediately brings to mind the idea that an asteroid impacted the area of Hellas Basin, and the shockwave traveled clear across the planet causing a bulge of Tharsis Rise, and causing multiple volcanoes to sprout there.
Is there anything to this impression, or am I entirely wrong?
