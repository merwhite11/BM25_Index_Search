First time visit to dark sky stargazing site: what do I need?

Complete newbie here. I have an opportunity to visit one of the few designated dark sky sites here in Pennsylvania, Cherry Springs State Park. I plan on camping out over night, but I have never gone stargazing before, don't use a telescope, and I don't know what the protocols are as far as binoculars? glasses? Etc. for viewing the night skies. The park allows no lights, save for flashlights covered with red tint. Is there anything else that you more experienced astronomers would suggst that I need to have with me? What should I bring? What should I expect for my first observation tour ever? Thank you.
