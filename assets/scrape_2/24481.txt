Is the American Astronomical Society 230 years old?

The BBC News item Light shed on mystery space radio pulses is interesting enough in its own right. But I noticed that it is reporting on news from the 231st meeting of the American Astronomical Society.
These kinds of meetings are usually annual; for example the 120th Annual meeting of the American Physical Society will be in 2019.
Were there enough astronomers in the US in 1787 to have an American Astronomical Society and it's first meeting?
If it turns out that the answer is that meetings were more frequent than annual, why would that be?
