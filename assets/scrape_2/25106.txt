What will the last day of humanity look like?

It's certain that human life on Earth will not go forever. Therefore there will be one last generation of humans on Earth. 

How will life look like for last few generations approaching the end?
How will life end for the very last people, will they all die at once as if struck?

Assume the technology won't be much more advanced than today, no colonized planets, and we'd stay biologically very similar to now. Also assume that no meteor will struck us and end everything but that extinction will happen due to aging of the Earth and Sun.
