Uranium accumulating inside a White Dwarf?

A couple of days ago, there was news that "Some dead stars may harbor enough uranium to set off a thermonuclear bomb", which is basically a teaser for Actinide crystallization and fission reactions in cooling white dwarf stars where the authors conclude:

The first solids that form as a white dwarf (WD) starts to crystallize are greatly enriched in
actinides because of their large charges. We estimate that
these first solids could be so enriched in actinides that
they may support a fission chain reaction. This reaction
could ignite carbon burning and lead to the explosion of
an isolated WD in a thermonuclear supernova.

Going through manuscript, it looks to me that this conclusion is drawn from molecular dynamics simulations  of a cube of up to $10^4$ ions. What exactly is the line of argumentation of these microscopic observations from computer simulations are to macroscopic effects in the star?
I understand, that a main question of the research was, whether a certain scenario is actually possible (inside a white dwarf), or literally

Could uranium, [...], accumulate inside a white dwarf?

Just to clarify: I am not doubting the conclusion or questioning the method per se, I am just curious whether such an approach is usual for studying stellar evolution. Differently put: Is there a standard theory describing the conditions when the conditions are right for a white dwarf to explode?
