If Earth was a moon of Jupiter orbiting at the same distance as Metis (Jupiter's innermost moon), then how much lighter would a 100 kg person feel?

Metis is Jupiter's innermost moon, orbiting at a semi-major axis of 128,000 km. If Earth were to magically replace Metis, then how much lighter would a human weighing 100 kg be?
There's no need to ponder over how Earth would interact with other Jovian moons, this is purely a hypothetical.
I assume that tidal forces are the factor at play here, but they're out of my knowledge and that's why I'm asking this question.
