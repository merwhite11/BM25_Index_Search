Energy deposition in planet Earth due to gravitational waves

The gravitational wave detected by the LIGO observatory acted on planet Earth streching and shrinking it a little bit. I assume that not all of this action was fully elastic and that some energy of the gravitational wave was lost by the passage through planet Earth.
Are there some scientific estimates of how much energy was deposited in planet Earth by this gravitational wave?
Are there estimates how much energy is in total deposited by gravitational waves in planet Earth per year?
