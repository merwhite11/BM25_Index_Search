Cases of gravitational lensing resulting in a recognizable image of an extended object?

There are several different classifications of gravitational lensing phenomenon.
Here I am asking for any examples of strong lensing where the lensed image of an extended object is magnified and recognizable as an extended object. Of course it may be distorted somewhat, but if the lensed object is a galaxy, then the lensed image should appear larger and "galaxy-shaped" even though distorted. If it's a tight pattern of stars or other objects, then the pattern should be larger.
I have a strong memory of reading about such a case in Nature or Science within the last few years, but I can not find it. I believe that the nearer, lensing object was a galaxy.
