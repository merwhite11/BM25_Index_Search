How does metallicity reduce the likelihood of black hole formation?

Large stars collapse and if they are large enough form black holes. But the likelihood reduces with metallicity.

What mechanism facilitates this? I believe it has something to do with opacity and Eddiington luminosity but haven't been able to find a source that pulls the information together in a conceptual manner.
