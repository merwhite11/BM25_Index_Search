Where does the energy of the decaying CMB go?

I would expect that energy of photons in the Cosmic ray Microwave Background gets less and less because their wavelengths are stretched due to the expansion of space.
How can this be possible? Does it only look like their wavelength is increasing because we, as observers are not "expanding along"?
