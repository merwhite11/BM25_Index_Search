If an asteroid twice the size of Earth passed super close would half of the Earth be pulled towards it?

So let's say that an asteroid the twice the size of Earth passed by going relatively slow say in between the Moon and Earth.
Among so many other things (and perhaps you can touch on some of the biggest 'other' things), would anything on the asteroid's side of Earth be essentially 'sucked' towards the asteroid. That is if I am standing outside and it passes would I lift off the ground and float towards it? 
Conversely, would things on the opposite side experience two times the standard weight? That is if I am standing on the other side, would I feel heavier as the asteroid passes?
I realise there would be many other devastating effects but I'm most interested in this one...
The possible answer I suspect is that objects on Earth will not 'feel' anything as the Earth as a whole will move towards the asteroid and not every little thing inside Earth...
