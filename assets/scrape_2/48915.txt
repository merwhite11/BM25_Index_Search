Are Buckyball-sized black holes possible?

The first item is the basic question; the subsequent items build upon it if it's possible.  If these need to be broken into separate questions, I can do that, but they're pretty tightly related.

Is a non-rotating negatively-charged singularity small enough to be contained by a C₆₀ Buckyball theoretically possible?
Would the charge repulsion of the carbon electrons be stronger than the gravitational attraction, keeping the singularity from consuming them?
Is it theoretically possible for a singularity to be too small to absorb hadrons or even elementary particles?
Anything this small would doubtless evaporate very quickly, but just how long could they last?

Thanks!
