Black Hole growth

The latest info on black holes with regard to their formation is that since space and time go to infinity at the event horizon, from an outside perspective nothing ever enters a black hole, and it also takes an infinite amount of time for the black hole actually to form. Thus, from an outside perspective, no black hole ever is completely finished becoming a black hole, and because of Hawking Radiation, every black hole will evaporate before it fully becomes a black hole, so there will never actually be any fully formed black holes in the universe. Fine, no problem. Question is, since nothing ever enters a black hole, do black holes actually grow in size (that is, the event horizon getting bigger), or are they forever restricted to their original size (apart from two black holes combining to form a larger event horizon)?
This is not about matter accreting on the event horizon; that's the issue, in fact. Rather than crossing the EH and entering the BH, matter seems to accrete on the EH and never goes in. So the BH never grow, the EH never gets larger due to accretion of matter.
The outside observer is not infinitely far away; it's space-time that goes to infinity at the Event Horizon. In fact, it seems to be true that the closer one gets to the EH, the further away one is and the longer it takes to get there, approaching being infinitely far away in both space and time.
