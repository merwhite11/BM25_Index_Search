How does the hypothesis of the "inconstant Hubble constant" solve the current crisis in cosmology?

It was published in a paper more or less like two months ago. I'd like to know also if more accurate measurements are necessary to close the gap between the model of the universe and the data reported.
For the record, here's the link to the paper: https://news.umich.edu/an-inconstant-hubble-constant-u-m-research-suggests-fix-to-cosmological-cornerstone/
