Is there any observational evidence for dark matter vortices?

The paper here "Vortices and waves in light dark matter" https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01188
says that in dark matter halos vortices arise. In a vortex some particles move faster than others - the velocity depends on 1/r according to the paper.
This should lead to an uneven relativistic mass increase increase. Is this enough to bend light from stars as it approaches the Earth so telescopes detect it?
