How come I can point to two places with telescope and have the same coordinates?

Absolute beginner here.  I read through the telescope manual, watched many videos, and got a pretty decent understanding of DEC and R.A.
However, I don't understand one thing (where theory doesn't match what I see).
On the equatorial mount, you can change DEC by moving the telescope to the left or the right. The picture DEC was set to point to Polaris (~90), and DEC goes down to the left and the right.

Let say I lock R.A. (so it's a constant), And I turn the telescope to the left to set DEC to 50. It points at some place.
I don't release R.A. (so it's still constant) and turn the telescope to the right to set the same DEC (50) only on the right side. And now the telescope points to a different location.
Per my understanding, DEC + R.A. is a coordinate system. As a result, I am puzzled how two points can have exactly the same coordinates.
