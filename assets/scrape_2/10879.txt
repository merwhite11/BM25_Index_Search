Is mass+energy conserved when a new universe forms inside a black hole?

My understanding is that there are credible theories out there in which the formation of a singularity in a black hole also represents the beginning of a new universe via a big bang. We can't see the new universe because we can't see anything from within a black hole. Further, the apparent size of the black hole to us does not have to equal the size of the new universe from the perspective of someone inside that universe. My question is, is mass+energy conserved? That is, is the total amount of material within the new universe limited to how much stuff has fallen into the black hole, or how much stuff has reached the singularity? If so then it would seem these black hole universes are only a tiny fraction the size of our own universe.
