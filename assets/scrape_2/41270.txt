Celestron uncommon DC long barrel connector

I have tried to connect a 12v DC adaptor and also a battery pack to my telescope unsuccessfully. Sadly it seems Celestron DC jack needs to be around 2mm longer than common 5525 DC ports.
I was wondering what are those barrel connectors called so I can google it to find a male to male cable that is compatible.
And if Celestron is using an uncommon port to make customers buy its products or there is a technical reason for that?
