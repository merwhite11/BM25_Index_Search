Trying to identify something I saw in the sky

I'm trying to identify something I saw in the sky. This occurred in central Virginia (Louisa county), US on Sunday at around 2:15 AM EST. It started as a ring of what looked like smoke, high in the sky. The ring got gradually larger. Then a small light moved out of it. The light looked like a star but it was moving about the 'relative' speed of an airplane viewed from the ground. I say relative because I think this was higher up than an airplane and so it was probably moving faster. The light had a puff behind it which was much larger than the light (so it was much bigger than the entrails of a jet plane). When I say 'big' or 'small' I mean it relative to the view of someone standing on the ground. I kept observing this light moving across the sky until I lost it in the trees.
I have not seen anything like this before. If I had to guess, I'd say it was possibly a military plane at high altitude moving at high speed. I guess it could also be a meteor that caused the ring when it hit the atmosphere and moved off at a strange angle. However, I have never seen a meteor move that slow. They usually zip fast across the sky. Maybe it's a meteor that hit the atmosphere at an angle that slowed it down? Anyone know what it could have been?
Edit: I saw this photo submitted to the american meteorologic society. It's about the same time and looks exactly like what I saw. It was from someone in PA at 2:30am.

Additional photo: from Wisconsin, this photo shows the ring at an angle. I suppose this could be used to figure out the altitude of the ring: https://fireball.amsmeteors.org/members/imo_photo/view_photo?photo_id=12442
