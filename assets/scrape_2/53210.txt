What are the twinkling stars in the New Horizons Arrokoth approach?

I've circled them in this edit:

Note, this has generated frames, see the source. The twinkling stars are regular though, almost taking turns to twinkle.
I know it is sped up, are those variable stars, that vary that much regularly over the course of hours and days? If so wow, how many stars are like that?
Are there any good videos that show the sky in time lapse demonstrating what it would look like to see the stars twinkle like that?
