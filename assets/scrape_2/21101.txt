How do we calculate heat flow or cooling rate for no fusion brown dwarf star?

I was reading this article and it said something that didn't sit right with me.
"SIMP0136 still gives off light mostly in the infrared wavelengths, as its temperature is now approximately 830° C (1,526° F)," Gagné told us. "It will take it approximately 10 billion years more before it reaches 0° C"
SIMP0136 was classified as a brown dwarf star but when they just recently figured out its mass to be only 12.7 times that of Jupiter they downgraded it to a gas giant planet.  The threshold to qualify as a brown dwarf is 13 Jupiter masses.
Like gas giant planets, brown dwarf stars do not gave enough mass for fusion to occur so the term star is a bit misleading.  Since there is no fusion, then it should eventually cool down.  The 10 billion year cool down time to go from its present 830 deg C to 0 deg C seems way too long.  How do they calculate this?
