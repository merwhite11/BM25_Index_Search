What is it that distinguishes one atmospheric layer from another?

The atmosphere of a planetary body (assuming it has an atmosphere) is described as being made up of distinct layers.  
For example, Earth, Saturn and Jupiter all have a stratosphere and a troposphere.
What is it that defines where one layer stops and another starts?
