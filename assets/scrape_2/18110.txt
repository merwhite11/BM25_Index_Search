In SETI has anyone calculated an estimate of the mean time between observations?

So the Drake Equation, proposed by Frank Drake, is often cited as a means to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations that exist in the observable universe. 
Initial calculations by Drake came up with a number of about 10,000 civilizations. But refinements in the equation on how to interpret, and updated data, have recently led to this evaluation published in Astrobiology Magazine:    "There is a 75% chance we could find ET between 1,361 and 3,979 light-years away"
But what I'm more interested in has to do with our technology and efforts in detecting the first civilization in terms of estimating a mean time between observations. 
Surely given the result of the Drake equation, our current efforts, and possibly other factors to consider such as sampling theory there must be a way to calculate this. Has anyone pursued this? If so what are the results? hours?, days? years? centuries? 
Such a calculation I believe would justify more concerted efforts and investment or otherwise abandonment of any hope. Or perhaps a different strategy to mitigate the assumptions on the calculation to reduce the mean time.
