What caused instant jumps and exactly flat periods in Kepler's light curves?

Last 65 days of Kepler's light curve for the infamous KIC 8462852 star is shown below from the published paper's graph. Skip the dips here, I wonder about two other features:

Day 1559, during a period which is calm but also the very brightest, the light curve instantly and permanently drops by half of a percent.
Days 1581 to 1587 the light curve is exactly flat (also days 803-809
not shown here). Is the real data for those periods lost?

Are such features commonplace or another particularity for KIC 8462852?
How wide would a confidence interval typically be for a finished Kepler light curve when all adjustments for telescope movements and whatnot have been made?
