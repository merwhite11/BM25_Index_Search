Any tip on maintaining a log of celestial objects?

I am an amateur observer and Olympus 10x50 binocular is my tool. As I keep locating celestial objects (Planets, Stars etc), I would like to maintain a log of the observed objects. The purpose of the log is to list down the number of celestial objects I have observed/located. I need suggestion on what data points should I capture which helps in making some sense out of it and also encourage my friends to get into star gazing.
