Planetary observations: what to expect from the Powerseeker 50AZ?

I bought the Powerseeker 50AZ, which has D=50mm; F=600mm F/12 which comes with 3 eyepieces: 20mm, 12.5mm and 4mm.
As far as I can tell it's not possible to colimate this telescope. As suggested here this is a very important part to see sharp images.
I have tried to observe jupiter and mars with it and jupiter I could see a dim small blurry image and mars a very tiny dot with absolutely no way of seeing details on any of those in what seemed the best focus I could get from them.
The only thing I can see details is the moon really. Also I have observed in what seemed very clear sky conditions.
So my question is:
How much can I expect to see from planets with this telescope? 
With this current setup should I be seeing jupiter and mars in more details?
