Does the universe have a celestial north?

You are away from the Earth in one part of the universe and looking at a galaxy in another part of the universe, then which way is up?  Does the universe (or near universe) have a celestial north? If you took a picture of that galaxy, then is there a correct orientation for displaying that photograph?
