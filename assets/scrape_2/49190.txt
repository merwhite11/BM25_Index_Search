Rotation direction of Pulsars

Pulsars are rotating neutron stars observed to have pulses of radiation at very regular intervals that typically range from milliseconds to seconds. It has a very strong magnetic fields which funnel jets of particles out along the two magnetic poles.

My question is how Pulsars rotate, clockwise or Anti-clockwise?
