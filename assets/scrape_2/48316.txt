Why will HD 84406 be chosen as the first target for testing JWST?


HD 84406, is a star approximately 241 light-years away in the constellation of Ursa Major. HD 84406 will be the first star to be imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope in order to test the focus of the telescope. The star is a spectral type G star and has a high proper motion.

Why aren't the other more popular stars like Alpha Centauri or Betelgeuse chosen for the first light instead?
Which properties of HD 84406 make it beneficial to the telescope mirror testing? Spectral type? Magnitude? Distance? Does the star have any interesting stuff? Or is it just for the reason that the position of the star is the most convenient for JWST to locate during the test process?
