Why isn't the Sun hollow?

[Edited to remove incorrect geological assumptions]
The sun is self-rotating, i.e. it spins on its axis. When something spins, there's an apparent force away from the centre, and matter gets flung out. The sun's surface is gas; it follows that beneath the gas surface there could only be void with the density less than the surface. So, is the sun hollow, and if it isn't, what's the reason that the centrifugal force doesn't spin the matter outwards?
