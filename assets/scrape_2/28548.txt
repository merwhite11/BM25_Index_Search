What is a "differential chemical abundance"?

Probably this is a extremely basic question, but after a lot of time searching about it without results (in all the sites/publications i've found they only use this term but there is no specific definition)i came here with the hope of get an answer to my question: in the context of chemical abundance in stars, what is a differential abundance?
I already know what is a chemical abundance, the question is simply about the implication of the "differential" word.
Specifically, my doubt emerged when i was reading this publication.
In the second paragraph of the section 3.2 "Stellar Parameters" is the first encounter with this concept:

We adopted the same line list as in Ramírez et al. (2014). The
  EW  measurements  were  used  to  obtain  elemental  abundances
  with the
  abfind
  driver of MOOG (Sneden 1973), using Kurucz
  model atmospheres (Castelli & Kurucz 2004). Then, line-by-line
  differential abundances were obtained.
The stellar parameters
  $(T_\text{eff}, \log g, {\rm[Fe/H]}, v_t)$
  of HIP 68468
  were determined by imposing a differential spectroscopic equilibrium  of  iron  lines  relative  to  the  Sun  (e.g.  Meléndez  et  al.
  2014a), using as initial parameters the values given in Ramírez
  et al. (2014). The solar values were kept fixed at
  $(T_\text{eff}, \log g, v_t)
= \rm
(5777\,K, 4.44\,dex, 1.0\,km\,s^{-1})$. Our solution for HIP 68468
  gives consistent differential abundances for neutral and ionised
  species of different elements, and also for atomic and molecular
  lines, as discussed in more detail in the next section.
