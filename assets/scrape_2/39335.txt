What is a good focal length for DSO

I found two telescopes that i'd like to buy, but one has 900mm focal length ((Skywatcher Newton 114/900 EQ1)) and the other has 500mm focal length ((National Geographic Dobson N 114/500)).
My questions are:

What is the "recommended" focal length for observing deep sky?
Are there better telescopes in the same price range?
