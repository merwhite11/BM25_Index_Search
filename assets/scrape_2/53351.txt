Why are there not a whole number of solar days in a solar year?

I've been trying to find an answer to this question for some time now, and I seem to be missing something. I understand that the rotation and revolution of the Earth are not synchronized. I understand that solar days and years are mean averages of the actual fluctuations over a year. And I know that solar days and years are different than sidereal ones. However, if the sun appears to be in the exact point in the sky as that time the previous solar year, how does the earth reach this exact position while only being 5hrs, 48 min, 45 secs into its final rotation of the year? Wouldn't that difference of almost 6hrs or 18hrs mean it would be an entirely different time of day than the previous year? Can someone please tell me what I'm missing her?
