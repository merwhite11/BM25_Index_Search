What is the concentration of molecular oxygen in the Martian atmosphere?

In the early 1970's and prior to the Viking landers, T. Owen measured the oxygen in the Martian atmosphere at 0.3%, I believe by doppler shift methodology through the Earth's atmosphere (wow).  During entry, the Viking spacecraft reported 1.3%.  I've heard (but not confirmed) that the MOXIE experiment used 1.3% in its modeling.  Are there more recent measurements, perhaps spectral from nearby spacecraft?  The source of O2 includes photolysis of CO2 (2CO2>2CO+O2), and the amount might provide some information on the sources and sinks in the Martian environment.
