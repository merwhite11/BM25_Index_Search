Why does gravity make everything round?

I am studying ways to make an anti-gravity machine (!!). I believe it can be done, or theoretically be done using gravity itself as a "force" that pushes outwards instead of inwards.
A similar question was asked here, which speaks about why objects in the universe are round, which as stated, is due to Gravity.
I understand Gravity is the strongest, most consistent "force" in the universe and to traverse it we have to push against it - jets, propulsion, etc.
Never the less, I am perplexed why gravity's forces make objects round - eventually or over time. Why can't it turn a planet into a cube for example? Why can't Gravity make objects flat, and perhaps round at the perimeter?
If I can answer this question, I am sure I can find a way to "bend" Gravity for my invention.
