Are there pictures from a solar eclipse of the earth taken from a moon landing unit or orbiter?

Did any moon landing vehicle or orbiter took pictures of a solar eclipse happening on the earth, i.e. the moon's shadow on the earth? (Alternatively from other spacecraft showing the whole globe). A link to those pictures would be nice.
