Visibility of a planet on the other side of the Sun

Context: I've been having a discussion with my vectors and mechanics professor (course Mathematics BSc) about a problem on a recent coursework. The following is the model I came up with. I'm not an astronomer, so bear with me.
Define: 

$S$ the Sun;
$E$ the Earth;
$P$ some other planet in the solar system;
$O$ the position of an observer somewhere on $E$;
$0<l<90$ the latitude of $O$;
$\Pi_E$ the orbital plane of $E$, the $xy$ plane;
$\Pi_P$ the orbital plane of $P$;
$\Pi_O$ the plane tangent to $E$ at $O$;
$\alpha$ the acute angle between $\Pi_E$ and $\Pi_P$;
$\beta=90-l$ the acute angle between $\Pi_E$ and $\Pi_O$.

Assume:

The local time at $O$ is midnight;
The date is the Summer solstice;
The visual sizes of $P$ and $S$ are both non-zero but otherwise negligible;
The projections of $E$, $S$ and $P$ onto the $xy$ plane are roughly but not exactly collinear;
The solar system is Euclidean;
Light travels in infinite straight lines.

Given these assumptions, I think that $P$ is visible from $O$ if and only if $\alpha>\beta$. Am I right?
