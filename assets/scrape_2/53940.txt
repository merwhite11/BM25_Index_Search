Which kind of celestial body killed dinosaurs?

Well, the internet lies a lot, so there's so much information mixed with misinformation...
Some sources call what killed the dinosaurs an asteroid and others a meteor.
Is there any consensus on this?
By definition, an asteroid would never collide with Earth, because the moment it entered the atmosphere it would be called a meteor, or am I wrong? Or else, by the size of the celestial body and/or the speed with which it entered the atmosphere and/or the little impact that the atmosphere had in this collision, does it say that it was an asteroid that collided with the Earth, with no mention to meteor/meteorite therms?
Also, was it really an asteroid that started to enter the collision route with Earth, and not a meteoroid from a bigger celestial body?
Finally, if that body was so great that collided with ground, why is it not called meteorite?
Or is the total confusion in internet because there is no consensus in science community about that past event, and there are only a lot of hypothesis and a few evidences and theory?
