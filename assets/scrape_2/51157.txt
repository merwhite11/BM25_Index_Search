What are these bumps on Europa?

The surface of Europa is famous for all the criss-cross lines thought to be cracks in the ice above a water ocean that somehow re-freeze.
But in the photo below I also see a lot of raised "bumps" with roughly circular bases.
These are pretty tall as their shadows near the terminator can be resolved.
I hadn't heard of these before;

Is there a name for this kind of feature on Europa?
Are there processes proposed for their formation?
Roughly, how tall are they?


Cropped and sharpened from this tweeted image of Europa taken by the Juno spacecraft during a recent close flyby of the moon:
