Asteroseismology; recordings of star vibrations duration and data availability?

A short video titled "Why Tess is recording the "sounds of stars" at the bottom of the page of the BBC News article Planet-hunter launches from Florida gives a short description of Asteroseismology by Astronomer Bill Chaplin of the University of Birmingham.
Presumably the sounds played here are some kind of photometric measurements of stars that have been played back a few orders of magnitude faster to make them audible.
I'd like to listen to more of them, or even download a .wav or similar file and have a look at the spectrum just for fun.
I managed to find this University of Birmingham website through searching, and it plays sound clips from four different stars when the cursor is hovered over each one (it takes a while to become responsive I assume due to downloading).

Roughly how long is the observation time of the star necessary to produce these audio recordings of a few seconds in length?
Where can I find downloadable data; either these .wav sound clips or more traditional raw data files that I could analyze?
