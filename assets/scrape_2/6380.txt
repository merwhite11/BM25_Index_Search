Expansion of the Universe

Please forgive my ignorance. I dare say that these questions arise from me trying to understand the nature of the Universe using Newtonian physics. There are a few things that really bother me when topics such as red shift and expansion are discussed. 
1) We can view a Galaxy that is 30bn light years away because the light we are seeing it as it was 13bn years ago, and at that time it was only 13bn light years away. So, it has travelled 17bn years further in the last 13bn years? Faster than the speed of light?
2) 13bn years ago, it was 13bn light years away. That is around the time of the big bang. How did it manage to get that far away so soon after the Universe began. 
3) How is the known Universe even as big as 40bn light years, after only 13bn years in existence.
