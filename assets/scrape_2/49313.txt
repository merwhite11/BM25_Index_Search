Does the newly found orientation of Sgr A* match the theory that the Fermi bubbles might have been caused by jets?

The EHT just announced their great findings about Sgr A*, amongst other cool things they found that we look towards the black hole face on which means that if there is a jet it approximately looks into our direction.
Does this match one of the theories for Fermi bubbles, that they might have formed from the jets of Sgr A* or does the new information about the orientation rules this out?
