How do I know, mathematically rather than from observation, if a moon is full?

I know about the equations to describe the orbit of a moon around a planet. I know the moon's semi-major axis and eccentricity, and the same for its host world with the star they orbit. 
Is there any equation that tells me how much of the moon is illuminated at night, and possibly how bright, as seen from the planet?
