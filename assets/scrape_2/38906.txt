Physical size in different redshift

I have only recently started to study astronomy. I would like to ask if I want to get the angle of Mpc under different redshifts, but the result I calculated seems a bit strange. Did I make a mistake while converting?
from astropy.cosmology import FlatLambdaCDM
import numpy as np
from astropy import units as u
import math 
cosmo = FlatLambdaCDM(H0=70, Om0=0.3)

d_A = cosmo.angular_diameter_distance(z=0.3)
print(d_A) #  Mpc

x = 3.29*u.Mpc

theta = (x/d_A *(180/math.pi) *(1/3600))
theta = theta*u.arcsec

print(theta)
