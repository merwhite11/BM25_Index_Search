Could the Moon placed near the Sun-Earth L1 point remain in a heliocentric 1:1 resonant orbit with Earth? If Earth were at 1 AU, where's the Moon?

This answer to How much mass can be put in an L4 or L5 and it still maintain reasonable stability? has left me with the gedankenexperiment of the Earth in a circular orbit around the Sun, and the Moon placed somewhere near where the Sun-Earth Lagrange point would normally be.
