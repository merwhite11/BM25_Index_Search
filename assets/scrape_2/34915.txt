What does this "web on the surface of the Sun" image reflect? What does 789 nm show us?

What is this web on the surface of the Sun? has got me thinking.

This is probably not a normal color photo.
The cooler areas are really dark!

update: Comments point out 

The NSO press release says the passband is 789 nm.
"Images have been processed to remove noise and enhance the visibility (contrast) of small-scale (magnetic) features while maintaining their shape. The movie frames have been smoothed to remove noise."

Question: What does this image at 789 nm show us? Are we looking at changes in blackbody radiation or is there a spectral feature that tracks something more specific? Does intensity in the image actually track temperature directly, or reflect it in a more subtle way?
