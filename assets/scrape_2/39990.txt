If an exoplanet transit we are seeing is 13000 light years away, are we seeing a 13000-year-old orbit?

If a star is 13000 light years away, doesn't that mean we are seeing 13000-year-old light?  If it does, then does that mean when we discover a planet with dimming star light, we are seeing a planet that is 13000 years old?  Are we seeing a 13k-year-old orbit?
