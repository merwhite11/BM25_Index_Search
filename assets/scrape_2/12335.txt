How long New Horizons will remain operational?

As of now the New Horizons probe is well beyond the orbit of Pluto, moving towards the Kuiper belt. In an article I read that New Horizons will eventually follow the path of Voyager probes to the interstellar space. But how long it will remain functional and as further it will travel away from us it will also required very long time to receive data from the probe. Is there any pre-planned fate of the probe ?
