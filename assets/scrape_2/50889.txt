Does anybody know how to solve this Earth-Venus-Sun problem?

How can I find (in terms of the angle) the moment when in the system Sun-Earth-Venus, Venus can be seen the most bright if its brightness (flow received in Earth) is proportional to the size projected in its illuminated side? Â¿What percentage of Venus's surface can be seen illuminated from Earth at that moment? We have to assume circular orbits for the Earth and Venus around the Sun and the distances between those planets and the Sun are known (1 UA and 0,723 AU)
