Do objects that are invisible to the naked eye occlude much of the stars to Earth based observers?

I was looking at a star recently and some other object that appeared to be stationary in relation to the star was occluding the light to only one of my eyes. This is why it caught my attention.
I was able to move my head around this shadow and see the star but there was a definite tiny area where the star was clearly hidden. The object hiding the star also appeared to be a similar size to the tiny point of light of the star. Is this common to observe?
For the last few days I have been asking myself how many objects could be hidden like this (though most with shadows that engulf the earth); How thick are asteroid belts etc, that are between our eyes and the rest of the stars.
Is most of it hidden?
