Is there Dark Matter inside the Earth?

Since Dark Matter is assumed to interact gravitationally, it follows that the gravitation of massive regular matter bodies should have an effect on it. Even if it is otherwise weakly interacting with regular matter, one might naively expect concentrations of it enter orbit around massive objects, like neutron stars, regular stars, and even (why not) our own planet. 
So, a two-fold question:
1) Could there be Dark Matter in orbit around (or within) the Earth?
2) If that were possible, would there be any way for humans to tell if such is actually the case?
