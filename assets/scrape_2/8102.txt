In Chromoscope, what is the X-ray source between Ophiuchus, Libra and Scorpius?

Chromoscope is a nice toy. Pressing 'L' shows the constellations as guide. 
There's a bright X-ray source between Ophiuchus, Libra and Scorpius. In Hydrogen-Alpha there are two circular formations to the right and left of it. Are the latter formed by polar jets from the former, and what is that object?
