Why is today the shortest day but the solstice is actually tomorrow?

Here in Ashland, Oregon, today (Dec 20, 2020) is the shortest day length of the year at 9:05:45.  But the winter solstice isn't until 2:02 AM PST tomorrow (Dec 21, 2020). Tomorrow's day length is a whopping three seconds longer at 9:05:48.  Why is tomorrow's day length greater than today? It would seem to me that tomorrow's sunrise and sunset are slightly closer to the magic moment of winter solstice and should therefore account for a slightly shorter day.
