Is a General Relativity approximation available in Universe Sandbox (1 or 2)?

This answer points out that including General Relativity in a simulation can be computationally intensive and may not be present in Universe Sandbox.
However, answers to How to calculate the planets and moons beyond Newtons's gravitational force? discuss approximations that go most of the way toward including main GR effects in a typical solar system simulation where the effects are small.
Are there any options to "turn on" an approximation to GR in Universe Sandbox and/or Universe Sandbox 2? Or plans to add it later? And to double check, is it absolutely certain that only Newtonian mechanics is used currently for propagating orbits?
