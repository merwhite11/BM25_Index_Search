Finding raw HST data for WFC or HRC?

I'm doing a project that requires raw .fits images that contain a certain galaxy from the HST (F814W filter).
I've been able to find the calibrated images of the WFC view using the MAST data portal. However, there is no raw data listed. I would also like to find any of the corresponding HRC data as well if possible.
If anyone out there knows where to find the data, please let me know!
