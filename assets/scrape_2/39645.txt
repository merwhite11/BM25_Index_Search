Long-periodic sungrazers

I'm searching for long- and non-periodic sungrazing comets, like the Kirch comet of 1680 and the (meanwhile destroyed) Comet ISON. If you know a(ny) long-/non-periodic sungrazing comet(s), let me know here, please.
I'd prefer to learn about sungrazers that are not members of the Kreutz group, but you can also post Kreutz comets, perhaps that would be good too. Such an example would be Comet Lovejoy.
Also welcome are posts on sungrazing comets that once were long-periodic but have changed to periodic due to another planet's gravity influence.
Thank you.
