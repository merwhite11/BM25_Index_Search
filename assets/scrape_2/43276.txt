What is the significance of using baseline pairs in radio interferometry?

Radio interferometry utilizes arrays of smaller telescopes that are linked together to synthesize a larger aperture telescope. Astronomical radio observatories, such as the Very Large Array in New Mexico, consist of multiple radio antennas in various configurations (ie. 27 antennas for the VLA). When I read about the basics of radio interferometry, a lot of time is spent on the delay and baseline between a pair of telescopes. In other words, the light from the object will enter one telescope first before the other (unless pointed directly up) and a pair of telescopes act as 1 baseline. I don't understand the significance of these telescope pairs. Do the pairs act as a single pixel? I read that a pair of antennas measure one point in the u,v plane. Why are pairs of telescopes needed to do this and what is the significance to radio astronomy?
