Avoiding noise while stacking multiple night sky photographs

I have always been fascinated by astrophotography and have been trying my hands at the skill. I have tried photographing the milky way with limited resources (smartphone with a tripod). I usually click individual photos with 30s exposure, 3200 ISO and stack the raw images in the free software Sequator. Here is how an individual photo looks like 
After stacking 10 of such photos, and playing with the settings on Sequator, the best photo according to me, which makes the milky way more prominently visible, looks like this

Even though more stars are visible due to stacking and milky way looks more obvious (?), it does add a lot of noise to the image. I am specifically talking about the blue and purple colors that are added onto the image. Is there a problem in the way that I am stacking the images or do I need to next employ some photo editing software (Photoshop, GIMP) to get rid of this noise? Any help is appreciated! Thank you!
