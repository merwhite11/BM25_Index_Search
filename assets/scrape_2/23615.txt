How much time does it take for a meteor (shooting star) to touch the ground after its combustion?

I know that meteors that We see as shooting stars travel tens of thousands of kilometers per hour and are tiny as a grain of sand, but after hitting the atmosphere and burn I suppose that its ashes would touch the ground at some point. How long does it take? Can it be measured or observed?
