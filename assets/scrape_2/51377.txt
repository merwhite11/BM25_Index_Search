Could dark matter be ordinary cool matter far away?

We tend to think of the universe as the visible universe, but there could be large amounts of eventually hierarchically ordered, normal, matter that we can only observe at relatively close distances.
An example is dwarf spheroid galaxies which are so faint that they can only be observed in the Local Group. Today, about fifty dwarf spheroid galaxies are known, and the first one was discovered just a hundred years ago. The stars in dwarf spheroid galaxies are almost all billions of years old and there are no gas clouds to cause new production.
Another example is rocks of the kind that build up planets. They originally come from other star systems and could exist in space both gravitationally bound to stars and galaxies and in more isotropic motions between stars and galaxies, both in aggregates and individually.

My question is, is there any chance that the average density of such
(for us) invisible matter is close to the calculated density of dark
matter?
