Did a watch company really try to sue radio astronomers for using the word "pulsar"? If so, which astronomers?

After about 48:37 in the really wonderful video Jocelyn Bell Burnell Special Public Lecture: The Discovery of Pulsars (linked below) Dr. Bell Burnell describes the invention of the word "pulsar" do describe the pulsating radio sources she'd discovered.
One of the many humorous bits caught my attention:

These days as you know the name has traveled. There's watches called pulsars, certainly in the UK there's models of Nissan cars, you can sometimes find geraniums called pulsars, same name.
I'm told that in the United States the watch company tried suing the radio astronomers for use of the name!

The words "I'm told that..." suggests that this may be difficult to track down easily, but the story might be known to other astronomers or there may be other recountings of this.
Question: Did a watch company really try to sue radio astronomers for using the word "pulsar"? If so, which astronomers were the likely targets? All of them? Could it have been a radio astronomical society rather than an individual astronomer?


Jocelyn Bell Burnell, winner of the 2018 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, delivered a special talk at Perimeter Institute about her 1967 discovery of pulsars and her remarkable career in physics.
