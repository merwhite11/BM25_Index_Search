Would a spaceship have to evade interstellar clouds?

Apparently, there are clouds of "dust" between the stars. Would a starship have to fly around those clouds, trying to find "tunnels" between clouds, or are the interstellar clouds harmless for a spaceship?
I'm mainly thinking in terms of abrasion or (micro)collisions, not radiation, but would welcome information on the latter also.
