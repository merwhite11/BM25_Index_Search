On the day of total solar eclipse why was early sunrise observed in India?

I am a middle school teacher from India(UTC+5:30). On August 21, 2017 morning at (17.385044, 78.486671) we observed an unusually early sunrise. It felt like its 7'O clock in the morning at 5:45 AM. And we had an unusually bright day. I'm sure it has to do something with the total solar eclipse but I don't exactly know what it is.
My students are persistently asking me the reason for this early sunrise but I don't have enough knowledge of astronomy to answer them. Can someone kindly answer why we observed this phenomenon?
