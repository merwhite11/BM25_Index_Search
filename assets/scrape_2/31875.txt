Reference: First spectrographic observations by Fraunhofer

In several books I find reported that the first scientist to perform spectrographic observations of celestial objects was Fraunhofer with the spectrographs he himself produced. I do not find though a reference, a paper, in which he presents this work.
Using the NASA astrophysics data systems I find only the papers concerning his technical work with glasses but not the observations of Venus, Mars, and other heavenly bodies, he performed.
I find books on Google Books reporting such observations
but unfortunately I can view limited parts of these books and not their bibliographies.
Anybody can find a reference for any of these observations?
