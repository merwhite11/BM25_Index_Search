Starlight: are the rays that we see here on Earth parallel?

Are the rays of light emitted from stars that are perceived by an eye here on Earth parallel?
Do they travel in a straight line from the star to the eye, never crossing, and equidistant?
Do they wiggle around and cross as they move through space?
Do the rays meet at a point on the retina of the eye?
Assuming that a star is pretty far away, it seems reasonable to think that they've traveled zillions of miles without being parallel.
