If w bosons can create dark matter neutrinos by decay, can they also create dark energy?

Dark energy is often associated with vacuum energy fluctuations. But the experimentally measured Casimir effect suggests that there is almost no vacuum energy.Because most of the vacuum energy is supposed to be electromagnetic (virtual photons) and the weak force , mediated by w bosons is linked to electromagnetism through electoweak theory, has the energy of electromagnetism in the vacuum been converted into weak force energy - did virtual photons become w bosons at the time of the big bang and are  these a bosons now decaying into various other particles to yield dark energy?
