Can we detect a black hole's radiation?

Stephen Hawking proposed that a black hole emits radiation as it evaporates.
Black holes don't let any radiation escape their event horizon because even particles with the speed of light get trapped by their magnetic field.
Does that mean when black holes emit radiation, they just re-absorb it?
