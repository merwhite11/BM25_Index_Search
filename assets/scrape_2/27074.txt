Could an Earth-sized planet be cold?

This question poses the question of why the Earth is still hot after 4.5 billion years, and the primary reasons were:

(1) heat from when the planet formed and accreted, which has not yet
  been lost; (2) frictional heating, caused by denser core material
  sinking to the center of the planet; and (3) heat from the decay of
  radioactive elements.

With that in mind, would it be possible for a planet of Earth's size and age to have a cold core, mantle, and crust?
