What are the things, the hobby astronomers observe?

I was thinking:

What are the things, that hobby astronomers observe? (Things, that are in the domain of astronomy and hobby.)

I tried some googling, and I found just what do professional astronomers, but I was searching for hobby astronomers.
As far as I understand, hobby astronomers look at the things, that lie in or further than exosphere. Is this true?
So I came with this list:

Astronomers observe:
Objects:

galaxies
DSOs
planets
other solar system objects (comets, asteroids, sun – sunspots, moon – craters)
quasars
black holes (here I mean: if you know the position of the hypothetical black hole, you just point telescope there and say: "Oh, there is a black hole (but I can't see it)")
constellations (with the naked eye)
double stars (don't forget triplets!)
meteors
nebulae
clusters (open and closed)

Phenomenons:

transits of satellites (and ISS)
transits of moons (Jupiter, Saturn ...)
lunar, solar eclipses
NLCs
conjunctions


But this list isn't complete. I think that the Objects list is pretty complete, but I'd like to know, what phenomenons do astronomers look. (I am targeting to some special events, like NLCs and transits of moons and satellites, that fewer astronomers know.)
