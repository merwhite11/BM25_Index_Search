In 'Modified gravity' theories like MOND, are galaxies and stars actually, slowly accelerating? In the normal sense?

In the Modified Theory of Newtonian Gravity or MOND, they say that massive objects, accelerating slowly, experience this modified gravity.
But are they actually gaining in velocity, albeit very slowly?
Or are the MOND theorists using the term "acceleration" differently, as in the sense that all objects in a gravitational field are accelerating, even if they soon end up traveling at a constant velocity?
