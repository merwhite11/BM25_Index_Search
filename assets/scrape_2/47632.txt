Why is there a deviation between the ratio of $a^3$ and $T^2$ for the outer planets?

The Wikipedia article about Kepler's third law includes a nice table about the ratio between $a^3$ and $T^2$. However, for Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the ratio $\frac{a^3}{T^2}$ in $10^{-6} \text{AU}^3 \text{ day}^{-2}$ deviates from the supposed constant $7.495564252$. For instance, Mars' ratio is $7.4950842239$ when applying the formula, which is off by $0.0004800281$, while Jupiter's ratio is $7.50430207179$. Why is this happening? I don't think that it's because of orbital eccentricity because Mercury contradicts this hypothesis, nor is it gravitational perturbations between the body and the Sun because of Mars' case. I'm suspecting it to be inaccurate orbital measurements, but I would like to know for sure.
