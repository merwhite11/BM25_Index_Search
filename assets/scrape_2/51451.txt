Everything always looks the same

By now I have used 3 different telescopes and a pair of binoculars and no matter what I try to look at at night, whether it be stars, planets, drones, the moon or whatever, everything looks the same. Like a round ball with a squiggly river going thru it, a big black hole in the top left hand corner with a big blob moving around inside of it. And then a few craters scattered about. But why does it all look that way even thru different pieces of equipment and in different directions.
