Fact Check: How bright will the Perseids be in 2017?

A friend sent me an email which appears to be an extract from this Cambridge News article:

A meteor shower astronomers have labelled 'a once in a lifetime opportunity' will take over the sky in August. The upcoming Perseid meteor shower will be the brightest in human history so far, Physics Astronomy reported.
Anyone in the Northern Hemisphere should be able to view the shower on August 12. It is predicted to be so bright that stargazers should be able to catch a glimpse even during the day.
Astronomers believe that a shower this visible won't grace the sky for another 96 years. The Perseid meteor shower, one of the brighter light shows of the year, occurs annually between July 17 and August 24. The shower tends to peak around August 9-13.

However, this article sources its information from the website Physics Astronomy, a blog-type website which posts various articles on astronomical topics. Since Physics Astronomy doesn't seem to be a particularly reputable source, I will take this information with a pinch of salt.
So, is this article true? Will you be able to see the Perseids in the daytime with the naked eye this year?
