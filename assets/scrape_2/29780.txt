Is it possible that in the Local Interstellar Cloud there are undetected stars?

The Local Interstellar Cloud is supposed to be around 30 light years large. Is it possible that in this region there are stars which are undetected? I would have thought that it wasn't possible, but there are stars which are very small or are very close to another star. BTW, with star I mean an astronomical object which is performing fusion, because I've seen lists of smallest or coldest stars which includes brown dwarfs which don't perform fusion or white dwarfs.
