What would happen to the Earth if the orbit of another planet in the Solar System was disrupted by a cataclysmic collision with a large body?

There's plenty of speculation about what would happen if a large asteroid collided with the Earth itself, but less about the effect on Earth of a large asteroid or even a moon or minor planet colliding with one of our neighboring planets, e.g. Venus or Mars or Jupiter or any of them really.
Obviously the other planets are regularly bombarded with meteors just like the Earth, but I'm curious about what we might experience on Earth if one of the other planets suffered an especially large or catastrophic impact, perhaps one with sufficient energy to permanently alter the planet's orbit. Would life on Earth change noticeably, or nah?
I can imagine such an impact with one of our nearer neighbors, like Mars, might have more dramatic consequences for Earth than an impact with a more distant planet, like Neptune, but I'm not sure why. Any speculations?
