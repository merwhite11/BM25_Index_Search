Why do some images depict the same constellations differently?

For example, in some images of the constellation Gemini, it is depicted as some sort of strange-looking elongated rectangular sunfish (see Image 1), while in others, it looks like two distinct stickmen (see Image 2). Why is this so? I figured there would be a single standardised way of joining the stars by now.
