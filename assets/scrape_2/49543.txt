Celestial coordinates of every pixel in the image

I am solving starfield using Astrometry.net, an amazing piece of software I must say. After solving the starfield, Astrometry gives celestial coordinates of centroids of every star in the image, as well as celestial coordinates of those stars from the catalog. Therefore, it can be easily calculated on sky separation between stars in the image and stars in the catalog which can be used to calculate average solving accuracy. However, I would like to know what is the precision of mapping one particular pixel in the image, where no star can be found. I have its coords from Astrometry.net, but I don't have reference coordinates for that pixel from the catalog. Is it possible to know the position of every pixel from the catalog? Does someone have the same problem/task to solve? How would you calculate the average solving accuracy for some random pixel, or in my case, the accuracy of mapping the central pixel in the image?
