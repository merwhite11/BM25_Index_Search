Precautions when retrieving material originated from space

I'm assuming that when retrieving a meteor for study and later display, there are precautions taken against possible radiation coming from it. Is my assumption correct and are there other precautions taken such as protection from biohazards? (e.g. is it not possible for a meteor to carry a foreign viral agent?)
