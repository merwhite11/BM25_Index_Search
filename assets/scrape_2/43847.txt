How close to a host star can a tidally locked planet be and its dark side still maintain a moderate temperature?

So, imagine an atmosphere-less planet, tidally locked to a sun-like star. How close to the star can the planet be before its dark side becomes too hot?
I imagine that at some point the rocks on its sunlit side will melt and evaporate so that the dark side would experience rocky precipitation. Would this be true?
Also, at some point the atmosphere of the star itself would engulf the planet.
But at which point would these effects make the conditions on the dark side unbearable?
