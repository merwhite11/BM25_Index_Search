How small a location is possible to identify when any visible star is at its zenith directly above?

How small an area on Earth is it possible to identify with any precision when any celestial object (star, planet, comet, nova) (visible with the naked eye alone) is at its zenith directly overhead?
--Would it be possible to identify an area as small as a town, or village, a square mile, or an acre, or even a building? 
--How big an earthly location would be required to narrow it down if such a celestial object is directly above?
  Thanks.
PS:  I've tried to narrow the question down to get a simple to understand answer.  I'm not very technical, nor an astronomer.
