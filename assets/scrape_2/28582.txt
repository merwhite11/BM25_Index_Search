What is the apparent magnitude of the weakest stars we can see in one telescope on the ground with a diameter of 2.4m?

All I know is its main mirror diameter; 2.40 m
I also know that the eye, which its pupil is 5mm in diameter can see up to an apparent magnitude of 6.
How can I calculate the apparent magnitude that the telescope can see?
I have used the equation of 
$5â‹…log(\frac{D_1}{D_0})$
However, it gave the answer of 13.40, while the answer should be 19.40
