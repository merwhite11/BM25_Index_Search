How can I clean my lenses without causing scratching or damages to the lens surface?

Sometimes you can be trying to observe very faint or very small objects in the sky and it wouldn't pay to have these obscured or marred by a scratch or dust on the lenses.
I keep to good practices and make sure to replace the cap on the lenses when finished in order to stop dust buildup but inevitably it will get a little dusty and dirty, taking this into consideration:
What steps do I need to take to ensure that my lenses are kept in top condition?
Can I simply use a damp cloth or sponge and dab the lenses or should I use a softer material, like someone with glasses might have a softer lens cleaner?
Do I require a special cleaning fluid or can a good quality clean be done without any additional cleaning agents?
