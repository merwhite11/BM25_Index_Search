Remains of the progenitor of the Sun

It has been argued that it is not possible to trace back the remains of the progenitor star of the Sun (sometimes called Coatlicue), which, being estimated in the mass range of 30 $M_{\odot}$, should have left a black hole after its explosion as a supernova, nor is it possible to find the sister stars formed from the compression of the same nebula:

because "[The Sun] has completed many Galactic orbits [since its formation]. Not only that, but it could have migrated in orbital radius as well." and "These twin stars did not influence its development nor that of its planets [and] are now dispersed in the Galaxy and cannot be identified".
Why did the supernova's remains and the sister stars not remain gravitationally bound together? Why did they not share the same angular momentum of revolution around the Galaxy?
Why did these massive bodies formed from the same nebula not become a bound system among them and with the supernova's remains, like the Sun and its planets in the Solar system?
