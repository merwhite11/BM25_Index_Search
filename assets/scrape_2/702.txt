How can we tell if the asteroid 2013 TV135 will hit Earth in 2032?

Some astronomers in Ukraine have estimated that there is a small likelihood (1 in 63,000) that the asteroid 2013 TV135 will strike Earth in 2032. (source)
Don Yeoman of NASA JPL says:

with more observations, I fully expect we will be able to significantly reduce, or rule out entirely, any impact probability for the foreseeable future.

How can we improve our estimation of the potential threat posed by 2013 TV135?
That is, what process and techniques are used to calculate and increase the accuracy of our collision threat estimation?
