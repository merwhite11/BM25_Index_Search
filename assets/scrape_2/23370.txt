What if we are looking for the wrong signs of life on other planets?

I am by no means an astronomy expert, having only taken 2 semesters in college. But I am an avid follower of news reports that look for signs of life on other planets. Today it was announced that 20 new planets "with the potential for life" have been found. Along with the usual signs (temperature and water) these planets were also cited because one of them has a year of 395 Earth days, a very similar year to our own. 
However, I'm always bothered by these reports because they are all predicated on the premise that life on other planets will closely resemble our own. What if life on other planets doesn't need water? What if they are not carbon-based life forms? What if they can live in extremely hot (or extremely cold) temperatures?
It just seems like a massive mistake to (effectively) say, "this planet doesn't look anything like ours, there must be no life there" or to imply that only Earth qualities (or similar) can support life. Are there any fields of astronomy that look beyond the "near-Earth" life comparisons and look for life in other (drastically different) forms?
