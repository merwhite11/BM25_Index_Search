Power of the James Webb Space Telescope

I have heard that the JWST will be capable of looking at the early stages of the universe. However I have also heard that it won't be capable of detecting the Oort Cloud that supposedly provides comets for the solar system. 
How is the JWST able to see millions of light years away but cannot see a giant spherical cloud of rocks around the solar system?
