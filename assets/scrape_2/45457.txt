What is the percentage of ortho to para helium in the Universe?

Helium is the second most abundant element in the Universe with 24%.
But I could not find any data about what percentage is para to ortho.
In my opinion there will be slightly more para helium because its last energy levels are higher than that of ortho.
If you don't have data you can just comment my guess.
