Latest apoastron of Sirius

The only date that I can find for the latest apoastron of Sirius stars is 2019.  Is there a more detailed date with at least the month and/or day.  Obviously, it happened in 2019 but can't find any details. The date that I see in Wikipedia is a calculated date based on two and one-half 50.09 year orbits following the periastron epoch of 1894.13 giving a date of 2019.34.  This calculation assumes the orbital period of 50.09. I'm more interested in the actual recent observation/calculation that perhaps was done in 2019.  Thanks.
