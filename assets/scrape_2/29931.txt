Could Mars have oil?

What events could have to happen to Mars (which is thought to once look like Earth) that may have depleted the atmosphere and erase all proof of life ever existing at least on the surface? 
I know an asteroid could melt the planet but could there have been an event that could wipe the surface while leaving deposits under the ground intact?
There is no proof that Mars melted but there is proof that there at least was oceans.

Where did Mars water go?
