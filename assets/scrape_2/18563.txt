Why haven't I seen the Moon?

It has been some time since I've seen the Moon. What are the conditions that might affect whether or not the Moon is visible within a 24-hour period?
Please take into consideration any notable astronomical effects: moon phases, light pollution, other viewing conditions. I want this to be applicable to other cases as well as my own.
Here is my particular case:

I live in Wales. The date today is October 3, 2016. There has been no moon visible in the sky for the last 5 days, and I don't know why.
