How much larger would a star have to be to cause thermonuclear reactions if it was made out of mostly rock like Earth, instead of gases?

I assume it would have to be considerably larger since rock isn't as flammable as gases are? But it's also more dense to begin with..
Do we know of any suns that are made like this?
Is it even possible to have a thermonuclear reaction with solid rock?
