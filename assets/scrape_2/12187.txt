Acceleration in Galaxies Collision

In the far future the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide.
As far I know direct collision between large dense objects (black holes, stars, planets, etc.) is unlikely due to the relative "low density" of both galaxies.
My naive intuition is it's like two big clouds of dust merging.
I know at the collision time the Sun will be most like a red star and Earth a scorched dead planet.
For the sake of the next questions let's hypothesise another system with a star resembling the Sun and another small beautiful third rocky blue planet holding some advanced live form.
Also, for acceleration measures, let's use a frame of reference like if someone is observing from far away both galaxies getting close one to another and interacting.
Some questions pop up in my mind.

Can the gravitational interaction sling shot an entire stellar system? How much Km/s2 we can expect these system to accelerate? (In a most extreme plausible case).
How this acceleration can affect the system? Can it de-stabilise planet orbits for example?
How it can affect life? Can it affect magnetosphere? change it's shape? Can solar flares/wind get stronger in some path due particles acceleration?
If another star passes really near (let's say 1 light year at closest approach) but at great speed can its light reach that planet at high energy levels, let's say x-ray and affect that planet life?
