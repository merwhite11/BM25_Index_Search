Can the Hubble constant be measured directly?

By my calculations, the expansion of the universe should cause LIGO’s interferometers to alternate between constructive interference and destructive interference every couple days. Is this a practical way to measure the Hubble constant directly? If not, what prevents this method from being feasible?
The Hubble constant ≈ 70 (km/s)/MPc ≈ 2E-18 (m/s)/m.
LIGO uses 1064 nm lasers (5E-7 m per half-wavelength) that travel a total of 1E6 m (4 km × 280 reflections).
(5E-7 m)/(1E6 m)/(2E-18 m/s/m) ≈ 2E5 s ≈ 2 days for the laser travel distance to increase by half a wavelength.
