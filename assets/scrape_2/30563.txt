Radiative Flux, Irradiance and Luminosity confusion

First of all I know there is a similar question here, but I feel is wasn't answered at all.
My question is that I have seen many texts which says that Radiative Flux is equal to the Irradiance of a star. In Carroll & Ostlie book "An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics" even say that:



And Wikipedia's Irradiance on Earth's surface says this:

Average annual solar radiation arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is roughly 1361 W/mÂ².

Following this I first I assume that Irradiance and Radiative Flux are the same thing, but when searching for Irradiance on Wikipedia says that:

In radiometry, irradiance is the radiant flux (power) received by a surface per unit area.

Which means that Irradiance is Flux divided by Area, so Radiant Flux has units of J/s and Irradiance has units of W m^-2 which I remember from my Optics class, then again Carroll & Ostlie say that:



That doesn't mean if Irradiance is equal to Radiant Flux divided by Area, so F = I*A that would make Irradiance equal Luminosity / Area^2 ?
In that case the bolometric magnitude should be calculated with the integral of Irradiance, not Luminosity nor Flux right?
Probably I'm making it complicated for myself and it's not that hard to understand. I'm just sharing my confusion with you guys, please help me with that question.
Thanks in advance.
