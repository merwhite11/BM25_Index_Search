How much mass will the Sun have when it becomes a white dwarf?

In 4 billion years, when our Sun sheds all of its outer gas layers and turns into a white dwarf, how much mass will the white dwarf have compared to what the sun has today?
Will the planets still orbit in the same way, or will the reduced mass cause the planets' trajectories to change, so that they eventually leave the solar system?
