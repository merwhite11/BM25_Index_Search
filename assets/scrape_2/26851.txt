How to construct a sky map

First of all, I have very basic knowledge of astronomy so sorry if I make some mistakes in my terminology.
I'd like to plot the Southern Cross. I can find the name of its 5 stars. Also, I have some knowledge of Python and I've tried to use PyEphem and AstroPy. 
What I don't know is: what kind of information do I need to plot the cross on the circle? I mean, I'd like to plot it exactly at the right position.
The most difficult part is: the observer should be in Rio de Janeiro and the date should be 1889-11-15 08:30:00 UTC-03.
I tried to collect some info with the Astropy function FixedTarget.from_name() but, if I understood correctly, the date is too far in the past.
If anybody could give me some guidelines (maybe an online tool) to create a sky map with the cross in the right position, I'd really appreciate it.
