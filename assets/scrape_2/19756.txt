Is there a place in the known universe that there would be no visible light from other stars/galaxies?

Is there a place in the universe where, with the naked eye, you wouldn't see any stars, galaxies or light emitting phenomena? From what I understand at some point into the far future in Earth's location, we wouldn't be able to see anything. Is there a place like that could be like that now?
p.s. Not sure what the appropriate tags to put on this question. Feel free to add/change tags as needed.
