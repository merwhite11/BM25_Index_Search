What happens when the quasar remnants reach Earth in 3 million years?

According to this article, during:

(during) a quasar stage in its evolution (6 million years ago) ... the Milky Way’s central black hole swallowed a huge amount of gas, creating a shock wave that has now crossed 20,000 light-years of space. They say that event left behind a million-degree gaseous fog, a sort of “bubble” that extends from the Milky Way’s core two-thirds of the way to Earth. ... observed, via data from an X-ray spacecraft.

It's traveled 20,000 ly since it was ejected 6Mya and is now 2/3 of the way to Earth.  Thus, if my math is correct, it'll intersect with the Earth in 3My.
What then, for the Earth?  It'll be weaker due to the Square-cube Law, but it still seems like a lot of X-Rays.
And what's happened to planets around stars within the 20,000 ly radius?
