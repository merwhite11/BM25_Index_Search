Venus Atmosphere Color

I want to ask what color is the Venusian atmosphere without the presence of dense clouds for our human vision? I searched for this question, and did not find a suitable answer. Everywhere they write about the color of the sky Venus already in the presence of clouds. Would we be able to see the surface of Venus through the dense atmosphere without clouds?
