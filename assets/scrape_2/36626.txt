Apparently two objects in Solar Eclipse image

These images are taken from a mobile camera of 21 June 2020 solar eclipse.
So the thing surprising me is there are two objects.
I have shown these images to some people. Some says it's just reflection of sun in camera lenses. And some says the blue object is Venus. But we know if that is Venus then crescent should face the sun.
So I want to know what that light blue crescent object is. And if it is the eclipsed Sun then what is the other bright thing?
