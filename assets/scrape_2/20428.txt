Why is dark energy density given in grams per cm$^3?$

According to Wikipedia article,

The density of dark energy ($~ 7 × 10^{−30} g/cm^3$) is very low, much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies. However, it comes to dominate the mass–energy of the universe because it is uniform across space.

Other sources I found also give the density either as percentage of mass of the universe, or just as mass density like above, $kg/m^3$ or similar.
In about all other applications and contexts of usage of energy density, I'd find MJ/L, or other units of energy per volume. Why is energy of density given as mass per volume, and how do I convert it to more familiar units? Using $E=mc^2$ ?
