Any plans for TESS after it finishes northern sky survey?

TESS has provided the astronomy community with a treasure trove of information.
Once TESS completes its one year survey of the northern sky, are there any plans for an extended mission?
Just seems like 27 days is too short to look for three transits of planets orbiting in the habitable zone of M dwarfs.
Approximately what percentage of planets orbiting M dwarfs in the habitable zone and transiting our line of sight would be missed by 27 day observations?
Are there plans for follow-up observations with telescopes on Earth of 1 or 2 transit events picked up by TESS to confirm planet or not?
Looks like it was a very successful mission with data that will be useful for many years to come.
