Would the stars look different if many primordial black holes were present?

Suppose that there are many primordial black holes. These are point masses which have a small probability to collide with stars let alone themselves.
They are formed in the early universe and could have served as the dark matter guiding the formation of galaxies.  They are the ultimate form of dark matter, only interacting by gravity.
If they are indeed present then how would the stars look? Would they disturb our vision by a lensing effect?
