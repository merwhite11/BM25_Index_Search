Has the great Andromeda Galaxy ever collided with any galaxies?

We know that the Andromeda Galaxy is moving towards the Milky Way and vice versa, so there will be a collision. Because of the vast space between them, the  stars as they are defined will not themselves come into contact until much later if at any time at all.
My question is whether Andromeda has had a collision prior to this 4 billion year inevitability.
