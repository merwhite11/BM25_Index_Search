What is the cycle for when the maximum amount of the Moon's apparent area is sunlit?

The Moon is defined as full when its ecliptic longitude is 180$^{\circ}$ distant from the Sun's.
But what is the cycle for when the maximum proportion of the moon's apparent area is sunlit, and for observers at what latitudes of the Earth's surface is this maximum realised?
Notes
1) After first guessing (on this expert Q&A site) that the answer is "one lunar month" and asking me whether there was "a reason" why the said cycle might be different from it, user UhOh has requested clarification of the term "moon's apparent area", pointing out that the moon has a rough surface. The difference of the apparent perimeter of the Moon's disc from a circle does not have a bearing on the answer to this question that is of anything like the magnitude of the contribution made by the 5$^{\circ}$ tilt of the plane of the Moon's orbit around the Earth relative to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Please ignore mountains and craters. Please assume either that the Moon is a sphere, or if you wish then take it to be a spheroid with an eccentricity of about 1/900. The question is about the relative movements of the three celestial bodies concerned. (If further clarification is required of any other term used, please let me know.)
2) Wouldn't it be great if there were a website where you could input your latitude and longitude and desired start date and end date and get a graph of the proportion of the moon's apparent disc that is sunlit from your location? But I don't think this exists (yet!)
