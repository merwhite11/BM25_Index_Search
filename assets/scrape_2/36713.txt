Where can I get J2000 epoch initial mean longitudes for all planets and celestial bodies?

I'm following this paper to calculate geocentric coordinates. The authors have provided the initial mean longitude values for the planets (provided in attached table) for  01.01.2000 @ 00.00 UT but I'd like Uranus, Neptune, Pluto and some asteroids also. Is there anywhere this information is freely available or did they calculate it? Many thanks.
