Does the combination of concepts of "cosmic sensorship" and "Gregory-Laflamme instability" correlate with the "string theory"?

Does the combination of concepts of "cosmic sensorship" and "Gregory-Laflamme instability" correlate with the "string theory" since it appears that both require multidimensional spacetime structure of the universe?
This link explains in popular terms, meant for unprofessional readership (such as myself), what "cosmic sensorship" is. This link also mentions that the combination of the concepts of "cosmic sensorship" and "Gregory-Laflamme instability" is requiring multidimensional (more than 3) spatial organization of the Universe. Per my knowledge the "string" theory is also assuming multidimensional (more than 3) spatial organization of the Universe.
What I am asking is: whether this similarity of requirements is coincidental or else?
