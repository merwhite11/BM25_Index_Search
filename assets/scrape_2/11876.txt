Identification of Lunar mare (maria) from a taken picture

I'm in Brisbane right now. I took this picture 15 minutes ago from my balcony. 

Could you help me with identification of marked Lunar maria? I cannot compare any of these to this map.
I think 1 is Mare Serenitatis and 2 is Mare Tranquillitatis. Am I right?
