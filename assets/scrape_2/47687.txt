What is the differential emission measure (DEM)? what are its physical significant in solar plasma?

I'm trying to understand what differential emission measure (DEM) is, especially its physical significant in solar plasma.
Is it possible to give a short description and perhaps suggest to me some paper(s) or book(s) related to DEM that go further?
