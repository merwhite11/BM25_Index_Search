What kind of nebula was the Sun formed from?

I was just wondering what type of nebula did the Sun form from because mainly there are 5 categories: emission nebulae, reflection nebulae, dark nebulae, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants, so which of these was the Sun formed from and is there a name for this nebula? Probably M67.
