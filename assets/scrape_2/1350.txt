Are nebulae only visible from a distance?

There's plenty of data about the density of nebulae, and obviously they're pretty thin.  This is space, after all, and these things are really, really big.
But I'm wondering about the practical experience of that density.  Are the colorful patterns of gas only visible when you're far away and looking through them, or if you were inside a nebula would you see colors all around you instead of the black of space?  Are any dense enough to obscure the view between planets of the same solar system?  Between a planet and its moon?
