Did the Moon have a substantial atmosphere in the past?

The layer of gas surrounding the Moon is very thin. It is a surface bound exosphere, where particle-particle collisions are rare.
In the past, the Moon was more geologically active, with eruptions filling craters with magma and whatnot. Eruptions often come with out-gassing. Was this enough to give the Moon a thicker atmosphere, or was this gas immediately stripped away?
Did the Moon have an actual atmosphere at any time in history? If so, when did the lunar atmosphere reach the pressures we observe today?
