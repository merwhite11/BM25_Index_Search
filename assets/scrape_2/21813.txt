Shared moon in a double planet system

Would it be possible for two planets orbiting around each other to share a moon that orbits both separately? Would the moon in question would do something akin to a large figure 8 as it orbited both or would this be possible in the first place?
Also, what effects might we see on the planets because of this?
(Side note: This stems from a Worldbuilding question, but I figured I would ask the astronomy question on the Astronomy StackExchange)
