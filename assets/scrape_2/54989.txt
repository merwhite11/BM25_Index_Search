Could a galaxy be the sun of a planet?

For the purpose of science fiction, could an entire galaxy essentially be a planet's equivalent to our Sun for Earth?
If a planet were far enough away from other objects in the galaxy but still orbited the galaxy, especially one that was very bright, perhaps mostly composed of stars, could this planet feel much like Earth?
It would receive heat and light, and its inhabitants might view the entire galaxy as a brilliant point in the sky.
