Upgrading telescope from 5" to 8" or 10"?

I currently have Celestron Nexstar 130STL.  I am trying to upgrade my telescope to next one.  I examined Meade 8"ACF Goto telescope, but I was not too thrilled about it.  It gave me better view, but the details were not too different from my 130mm. 
Maybe my expectation was too big.  I have an option of getting Orion 10" dob motorized alternatively.  I am slightly concerned about the size and the portability.
I would appreciate any recommendation, thanks!
