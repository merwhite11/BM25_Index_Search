Is Jupiter's rotation slowing?

According to Wikipedia, re Europa's tidal flexing:

the tidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and gives it a source of
  heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving
  subsurface geological processes.The ultimate source of this energy is
  Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises
  on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital
  resonance.

Does this imply that Jupiter's rotation is slowing over time, since it is losing energy due to raising tides on Io?  (Or just generally, does raising tides cause rotation to slow?)
