What is the closest candidate for Dark Matter currently?

I've both fascinated and frustrated after learning about the existence of Dark Matter. 
Can we find evidence of Dark Matter within our Solar system? What is currently the closest candidate for Dark Matter?
And please let me know what are good online resources where I can stay up to date with information about this?
