Correlation Crab Nebula supernova and Noah flood legend. Perhaps Quantum entangled particles created instant space time distortion. Betelguese may too

Since the supernova in the Crab Nebula occurred at the same time as the legendary floor of Noah's Ark.
Perhaps there could be a correlation. Possibly Quantum entangled particles that were already in our vicinity instantaneously self destructed causing a Space/Time fluctuation or Gravity wave which disturbed earths orbit.
If so Betelguese could cause a similar incident when it blows.
There may be some faster than light Tachyon pulse or neutrino blast that could be detected prior to the event
If nothing else it would make a great SF story/movie.
