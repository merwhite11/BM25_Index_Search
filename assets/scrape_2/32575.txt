Is TDB monotonic? Does it or any of its derivatives have yearly discontinuities with respect to an atomic clock?

This in-depth answer mentions that 

...TDB is updated every year. As technology improves, these subtle updates change the timing of past events. 

This makes me wonder...

Does this updating result in yearly discontinuities in TDB relative to a smoothly-running (non-discontinuous) atomic clock?
If not, does it result in discontinuities in the first derivative of the difference?
Is TDB ever non-monotonic?
