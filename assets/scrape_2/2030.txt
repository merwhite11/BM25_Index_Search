why are galaxies different in color?

whether its in movies,television,real-life or some planetarium different galaxies are shown in different color.
For ex:- Milky way is always seen in Blue where as Andromeda gives out a bit reddish color. 
Is it because different galaxies contain different kinds of stars?
Does this effect the life the galaxy harbors...
