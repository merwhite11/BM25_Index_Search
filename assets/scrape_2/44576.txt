What would happen if a medium -sized black hole passed the Earth?

I asked already a similar question about the Earth orbiting a black hole but it was closed. So I ask a new one. What if the solar system passes a black hole? Say it has a mass of ten suns and the hole gets close to Earth but it will not enter the black holes horizon. The encounter is too short for that.
