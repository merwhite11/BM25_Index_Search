How is the mass and semimajor axis of a directly imaged exoplanet found?

I can't find information on this for the life of me. 
How do astronomers approximate the mass and semimajor axis of a directly imaged exoplanet? Would several photos need to be taken to find the period and find with Kepler's third law or can it be inferred through the temperature of the planet (or another method)? Also if you have any sources of this that would be great. 
Thanks
