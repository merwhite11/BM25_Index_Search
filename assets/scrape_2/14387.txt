What happens over time as a neutron star cools?

My understanding of a white dwarf star is that, although it hasn't happened yet due to the age of the universe, eventually as it loses energy due to radiating heat and tidal forces, it will cool to become a black dwarf - essentially a black ball of carbon.
What happens when a neutron star eventually cools? What is left, and do we know what it would look like?
