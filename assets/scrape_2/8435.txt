Why doesn't Earth's axis change during the year?

My understanding is that the Earth's axis points in the same direction in space during its entire orbit around the sun. And this is what causes our seasons.
My question is why doesn't the axis follow the orbital path (kind of like a car driving around a circle)?
I imagine the Moon plays a part in this.
As a secondary question, do the other planets in our solar system orbit the same as Earth (its axis points in the same direction in space for its entire orbit)?
