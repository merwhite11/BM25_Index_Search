What does the amino acid found in the atmosphere of Venus mean?

An amino acid is a part of DNA, but it has only been found on Earth. Is the amino acid maybe from one of the space vehicles that has orbited, scanned, or surveyed Venus? How can a part of DNA survive in the dense, sulfuric acid-filled atmosphere? Scientist's haven't been able to determine what organism it's from, but it hasn't been brought to Earth yet. Could this be from the water that covered most of Venus billions of years ago? Did some type of life start to evolve before all the water evaporated? I'm kinda new to this site and have always wondered about this, so thanks to anyone who has an answer!
