Power law distribution for galaxy populations

I've learned that observed galaxy populations exhibit single power-law clusterings within several tens of megaparsecs in comoving scale.
I'm trying to sample some astronomical data from this project: Illustris simulations, and I'm beginning with star (baryonic) data from galaxy subhalo scale.

Do cosmological objects exhibit a different distribution at this smaller, sub-halo, kilo-parsec, resolution scale?

If so, how large should my sample be so I can observe this power law distribution, using the dataset from Illustris? Should I use dark matter halos, instead of baryonic sub-halos?
