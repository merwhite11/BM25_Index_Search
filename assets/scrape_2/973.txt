How can only 1 magnetic pole of the Sun change at a time?

I read some news stories about the current Solar maximum and the flipping of the magnetic poles. They say that one of the magnetic poles has switched polarity and the other will switch in about a month. I don't really understand magnetism, but I had thought you had to have 2 opposite polarity magnetic poles. How can the Sun's magnetic poles not switch in sync with each other?
