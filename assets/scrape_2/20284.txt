Why is the moon phase not in sync with the moon's illuminated fraction?

I am using the following R script to plot the moon phase and the moon's illuminated fraction:
library(oce)

X11()

t_start <- as.POSIXct("2017-02-23", tz='UTC')
t_end   <- t_start + 75 * 24 * 3600  # 35 days

tm <- seq(from = t_start,
           to  = t_end,
           by  = 10000
        )

moon     <- moonAngle(t=tm, longitude=-8, latitude=47)
fraction <- moon$illuminatedFraction
phase    <- moon$phase - floor(moon$phase)

plot (tm, fraction, type="l", col='blue')
lines(tm, phase   , type="l", col='red' )

grid()

# wait for mouse click or enter pressed
locator(1)

This is plotted:

The red lines indicate the phase (0 = new moon, 1/4 = first quarter, 1/2 = full moon etc.), the blue curve indicates the how much of the moon is illuminated.
I have expected the illuminated fraction to be zero exactly then when also the phase is zero. However, this is not the case.
So, is there something I am missing, am I doing something wrong in my script or is the implementation of oce inaccurate?
