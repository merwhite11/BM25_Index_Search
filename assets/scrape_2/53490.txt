Astropy time: is it possible to use negative dates?

The goal is to find precessed coordinates for BCE dates.
from astropy.time import Time
equinox = Time('-0500-01-01') 

is just not working, though '0500-01-01' works just fine.  Is there a time format that allows BCE dates or years before present or anything like that?
