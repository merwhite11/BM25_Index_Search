Problem with Tychonian model of geocentric universe?

Just like other proposed models of universe in history, Since Tycho's aren't being used, there MUST be any flaws in compare with widely agreed today understanding
Is there any detailed reference criticizing his concept? Moreover in recent years? I've been searching for awhile by now but couldn't find one
If universe is both isotropic & homogeneous, shouldn't Tycho model be just fine for now? We simply take current model, but using earth as perspective. The rest still maintain the same

Or no?
edit: I think i missed Tycho's whole idea. I thought all the time he was referring to rotating earth, but after @James answer and some reading it doesn't seems so. My central question is on the assumption that his system have rotating earth. If it does, what likely be the problem?
