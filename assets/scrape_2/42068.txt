Does the radius of your cosmic horizon decrease as velocity increases?

If I was moving at c-1 meters per second, and was observing an object moving 2 m/s away from my starting point as a result of the expansion of the universe rather than classical velocity, would I ever see the light coming from this object? Does that mean that as you move faster, the radius of your cosmic horizon decreases?
