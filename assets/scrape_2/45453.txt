How can an area be on the day side 90% of the time?

In the magazine "Ciel & Espace", it is stated that crater ridge next to Shackleton crater is an interesting landing site for future missions because it is lit up 90% of the time.
I get how an area can be in the shade 90% of the time, but how can an area on the surface of a planetary body be lit up by the Sun 90% of the time?
