I'm considering buying a telescope, which type should I choose?

I am considering buying a telescope for amateur viewing. I am planning to view the stars from my backyard, which is in an area with reasonable light pollution (most of Orion's primary stars are visible). As a result of the light pollution, I have not been able to see more fascinating parts of the sky, such as nebulae. I am looking for a telescope with a limiting magnitude of at least $+12$, an angular resolution of $0.5 \text{ arcsec}$, is relatively easy to assemble. My budget is between \$500 to \$800.
I've taken note of the Orion Skyquest models, especially the 8" and 10" Build-A-Scope Classic Dobsonian Telescopes. However, before I buy them, I'd like a second opinion from this community. I have seen that it is not compatible with astrophotography devices like an iPhone without extensions. Is there anyone who can give me some recommendations?
