Can a hydrogen bomb explosion be seen from every distance?

When we use the strongest optic telescope available, how far from Earth can a hydrogen bomb explode in space and be visible for this telescope?
Is there a fundamental limit to this distance? Even for the strongest telescope, in the future, will it be impossible to see such an explosion in the most faraway galaxies (assuming they took place long ago)? Say it's a 100 megaton explosion.
