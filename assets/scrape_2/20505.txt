Relative brightness of the sun's corona

In preperation for the upcoming solar eclipse I'd like to practice my photography to be able to take some (hopefully) good photos of the corona during totallity.
What is the brightness of the sun's corona? How bright is it compared to a full moon (or other celestial phenomena)?
At what point during the "diamond ring" does it become too bright to look at safely without safety equipment, and what is the relative brightness of the diamond?
