Would Martian sunrise/sunset look the same at the Thaumasia Plateau as the rovers' photographs?

If observing the sunrise or sunset, with the naked eye, from the Thaumasia Plateau (app. 260°, -10°), 6 kilometers above Mars elevation zero, 
would it have the same blue hue as the images of the sunrise/sunsets taken by the NASA rovers below elevation zero?  
Would a higher elevation sunrise/sunset look any different because the atmosphere is less dense?
