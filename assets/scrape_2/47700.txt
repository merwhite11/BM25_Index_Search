Why isn't the CMB blurred by the blackbodies emitted in the time after atoms first formed?

I am confused about why the light released from the moment when gas first formed was so dominant in comparison to the light released afterwards. Why isn't the CMB in interference with a series of cooling blackbodies as the universe continued to expand and cool?
