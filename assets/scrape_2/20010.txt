Retrieving input effective radius from Sérsic profile

I'm playing around with Sérsic profiles, and would like to retrieve the effective (half-light) radius that I put in by integration of the profile. I'm not managing to, so perhaps someone can help me out.
I create the profile using astropy:
from astropy.modeling.functional_models import Sersic1D
from scipy.integrate import simps
Sersic = Sersic1D(amplitude=1,r_eff=1,n=1)

I can then make a light profile:
x = np.arange(1000)
I = Sersic(x)

Then we can perform an integral over this I(r):
integral = [simps(I[0:i],x[0:i]) for i in np.arange(len(I)-1)+1]

From which one would finally find the radius at which the enclosed flux is half that of the total:
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

f_int = interp1d(integral,np.arange(len(I)-1)+1)
print 'Half radius: ', f_int(integral[-1]/2.)

However, this does not give me the desired result -- the input radius of 1. Why not? Is this a conceptual error or a numerical one - or both?
