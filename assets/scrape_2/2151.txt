Will the UK be able to witness the tetrad in April 2014?

I live in the UK and am aged 15. I have become extremely interested in astronomy, astrophysics, the lot. Basically I have never seen a tetrad and believe this will be my first time - at least understanding what it is. I'm hoping it will be possible and if so where will it be seen in the sky? As in North, South etc. Thanks!
