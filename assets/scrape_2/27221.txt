What is causing this strange shimmering pattern of light during a total solar eclipse?

Below this question was left a comment linking to the Smarter Every Day video Space Station Transiting 2017 ECLIPSE, My Brain Stopped Working - Smarter Every Day 175.
At about 04:30 they show a short clip of a video recording of what looks like a white bed sheet hanging vertically and a shimmering pattern of light on it, I assume related to the total solar eclipse.
What's going on? What causes this? What's it called?
