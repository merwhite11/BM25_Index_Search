What do these coordinates mean: MW - VP101 3째 12' 43.2'' S 5째 12' 39.6'' W?

I have a jacket with a tag that bears the label:
MW - VP101
3째 12' 43.2'' S
5째 12' 39.6'' W

When I looked it up, I discovered that these are the coordinates of the crater Mosting A. However, I do not know what the letters at the top refer to. Does anybody know what they mean?
