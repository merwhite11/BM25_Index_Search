How to tell if a meteor video or photograph is fake?

With the Perseids at their peak, many people are sharing amazing photographs and videos — and some of them clearly more exercises in special effects than actual sky-watching.
My daughter's friend sent her this tiktok video, and my daughter, with healthy skepticism, thought that the speed seems wrong, and asked for my opinion.
Of course, Tiktok is a red flag, but the thing that jumped out to me is that the lines from the two purported meteors cross — shouldn't they be radial lines from the same point?
Beyond though, what should I look for? I am not really concerned with this video in particular, except as an example. What should one look for in general to discount faked meteor videos and photographs — both blatant and subtle?
