Impact verses vacuum

How do asteroids, comets and other stuff stay together when colliding in the empty vacuum of space, when they are made up of non-sticky substances like rock?
My understanding is that the force of gravity from small objects is very weak and when travelling at speed I donâ€™t see how they join together.
