How exactly can the Hubble Space Telescope see up to 15 billion light years?

I've been researching about the Hubble Space Telescope on nasa.gov, and I've read that Hubble uses a digital camera to take pictures like a cell phone. That's all I've found so far. I can't find any information on how it can see so far away into space. Is the digital camera built to see billions of light years away, or does Hubble have some technology on it that allows it to zoom into the deep space?
