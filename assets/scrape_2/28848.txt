Why is this moon red?

I wish I could attach a good quality photograph of this red color moon I'm looking at right now.
I searched on internet but there was no lunar eclipse scheduled to occur on 23rd December 2018
in  HYDERABAD, INDIAN SUBCONTINENT around 7:20pm
Please tell me why the moon is red tonight:) ?
