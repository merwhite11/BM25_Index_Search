Will the planets be pushed outwards when the sun goes red giant?

When the sun goes red giant will the planets be pushed outwards towards the periphery of the solar system?
If so, will this happen simultaneously to all planets or could, for example, a planet like Uranus move closer to Neptune so minimising the distance between the two?
If not, why would the orbits of the planets not be changed? What cosmic forces are involved keeping them in place?
