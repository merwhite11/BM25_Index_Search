What are the correct symbols for vernal and autumnal equinox?

What are the correct symbols for vernal and autumnal equinox? 
I have seen people use both ♈︎ (\Aries) and $\gamma$ (\gamma) to denote vernal equinox. However, I have never seen the symbol for autumnal equinox. Should it be either ♎︎ (\Libra) or $\Omega$ (\Omega)?
Are ♈︎ and ♎︎ the conventional symbols to use? 
Are $\gamma$ and $\Omega$ sometimes used just because they resemble the above symbols?
An alternative name for vernal equinox is First Point of Aries. Is there a similar name (First Point of Libra) for autumnal equinox?
