Derivation of the formula for longitude of ascending node for a satellite

I've been looking into the document IS-GPS-200H to understand how to calculate satellite location in the ECEF coordinate.
I am having problem understanding the formula to derive $\Omega$, the longitude of the ascending node (LAN) relative to Greenwich at given time $t$:
$$
\Omega = \Omega_0 + \left( \dot{\Omega - w} \right)\times t_k - w \times t_{oe}
$$
where:
$$
\Omega_0: \text{LAN relative to vernal equinox, at the beginning of the week}\\
\dot{\Omega}: \text{angular velocity for LAN, relative to vernal equinox.}\\
w: \text{angular velocity of earth, relative to vernal equinox.}\\
t_k: t - t_{oe}\\
t_{oe}: \text{ephemeris reference epoch}\\
$$
(and let us denote the beginning of the week as $t_0$ for brevity).
But if I try to work out this from scratch:

At $t = t_0$, LAN was $\Omega_0$. But since what we really need is the difference of LAN and longitude of Greenwich, we also need to know $w_0$, the initial longitude of Greenwich at $t = t_0$.
$$
\Omega(t = t_0) = \Omega_0 - w_0
$$
At the ephemeris reference epoch time $t = t_{oe}$, LAN and the earth both rotate with their respective angular momentum and hence:
$$
\Omega(t = toe) = \Omega_0 + w_0 + (\dot{\Omega} - w) \times t_{oe}
$$
As time varies from $toe$ to $t$, again LAN and the earth both rotate with their own respective angular momentum and hence
$$
\Omega(t) = \Omega_0 + w_0 + (\dot{\Omega} - w) \times t_{oe} + (\dot{\Omega} - w) \times t_k
$$
which obviously differs from the right formula by $w_0 + \dot{\Omega} \times t_{oe}$.

My question is where am I making mistakes/misunderstanding the eqution? 
Explain also why we don't need to know $w_0$ or equivalent input, that would be greatly appreciated.
