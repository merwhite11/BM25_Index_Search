Is there a general term used to identify the high flat features within Noctis Labyrinthus on Mars?

At the western end of Valles Marineris, where it mets Noctis Labyrinthus (highlighted section of image) 

there are a series of flat geological formations between the canyons.

Is there a unique term for these formations, or even one borrowed from Earth's geology?
Has the individual sections of these formations been named?
