Using a telescope to look at the Earth History in Some Detail

The following paragraph is a scientific fact.
When we look distantly into the universe (with telescopes) we see galaxies 
(or whatever else you see) as they were millions years 
ago- in other words it is how they looked in the past (this is because of the speed of light).
So my question is could we build a technology (using current science or more speculative/theoretical science) using this scientific fact too see the earth history or past to such a level of detail that we could see historical events (e.g. individual dinosaurs) and the famous people's faces (in history books) - as if we were standing face to face with them- of the long ago past? What's the best level of detail could we theoretically see?
