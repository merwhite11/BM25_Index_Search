Dark Matter's effect on galaxy structure

One "fun fact" that's always been, well fun. Is despite what most assume, our sun does not orbit a supermassive black hole or any object at the center of our galaxy.
Recently I read an explanation that our Milky Way is gravitationally bound to our local group. This would explain the predicted collision with Andromeda, and a formation of some super galaxy beyond that. However, I'm sure I've seen estimates of "the Sun's journey around the Milky Way", and local galaxies should have a fairly negligible effect on our sun.
An explanation I found that made sense was Dark Matter. More common than "normal" matter. Dark Matter's gravitational effects were the first hints it existed. Observations of galaxy's showed "normal" matter simply wasn't strong enough to maintain a galaxy's structure. Without Dark Matter galaxies would fall apart.
Here's where I'm unclear. Is it innacurate to say our sun travels around the Milky Way? The spiral structure of the arms seem to imply a general direction. I've been assuming Dark Matter was responsible for structure AND general rotation.  Where galaxies containing high concentrations of Dark Matter tended toward spiral structures, while galaxies with less mass tended towards undefined shapes and random star distributions.
Do galaxies tend toward order as total mass is increased, while reverting to complete disorder when a galaxy loses mass?
