Any good books to read for complete beginners?

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student(mathematics) but always loved the field of astronomy hence I would like to read something on the "side" in this field along with my work. So is there any good introductory book(s) for me to read? 
Thanks, any help/guidance will be greatly appreciated
Edit: I, personally, wouldnt call it 'too broad' as the question is asking for some introductory books but if not then, its fine :)
