Why are only some of the geologic features in Mars' Noctis Labyrinthus region named?

I found this page Names Approved for Six Cavi and a Tholus on Mars which lists seven features on Mars. I'm curious about the decisions to name only these features: Dalu Cavus, Layl Cavus, Malam Cavus, Nat Cavus, Noc Cavus, Usiku Cavus, and Noctis Tholus in Noctis Labyrinthus. Why only some of the canyon, graben and/or valley locations are named?  Does it have to do with the depth of the features? 
Doing a search for the area of Noctis Labyrinthus, Northernmost Latitude: -3.0, Southernmost Latitude: -13.0, Westernmost Longitude: 259.0, Easternmost Longitude: 268.0, I found only this,
