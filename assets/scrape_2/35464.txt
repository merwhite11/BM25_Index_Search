Does IC 1101 have any name?

IC 1101 is the single largest galaxy that has ever been found in the observable universe, but does IC 1101 have any other name or at least a nick-name, perhaps something more soothing to the ear and easier to remember?
Many times notable objects receive additional names besides those entered in catalogs of objects. Since IC 1101 "the biggest", I'm wondering if it's been singled out and given another name.
N.B. I know in future another galaxy will be discovered bigger than this. But I don't mind giving a good name to that also.
