SDSS. Google Sky and DeCaLs

(1) Please go through following image
Possible Super Red Giant?
However sdss shows it as galaxy! Am I missing something.
(2) Google Sky shows object in latitude and logitude format like this.
Is there any way to convert those numbers to Right Ascension (ra) and Declination (dec) numbers or opposite of that  so that I can spot google sky data on SDSS and SDSS object on Google Sky?
