Star versus Black Hole

I'm making a simplified animation for college project on how a star reacts with a black hole. I had known that a black hole sucks in everything and thus should be doing the same for stars. But upon my research I found out that recently a discovery was made that a super-massive black hole ripped apart a star. Now I've always been curious about cosmology and this took my attention and also worried me for my assignment. There were two conditions with the above mentioned calamity - one, the black was a super-massive one and second, the victim star was possibly already stripped off it's outer gaseous by the same black hole. My question is that the ripping apart happens in all conditions and the sucking in thing was wrong or it happens only in mentioned circumstances?
