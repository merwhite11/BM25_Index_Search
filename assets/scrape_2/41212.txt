On Augustus' Actual Prescription to Restore the Julian Calendar to Accuracy

I hope that I may ask this question here as I have seen some favorably received questions related to the Julian calendar on this site.
From James Evans' book, ``The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy,'' is the following snippet (pg. 165):

In praticular, it indicates that ``to bring the [Julian] calendar back into step with the original plan, Augustus decreed in 8 B.C. that all intercalations be omitted until A.D. 8.''
I know the Romans were ``inclusive'' counters---so may I interpret this as meaning that leap years did not resume until 12 A.D.?
Another source: https://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/julian.php specifically states: ``There were no leap years between 9 BC and AD 8 (or, according to some authorities, between 12 BC and Ad 4).''
QUESTION: Does anyone know for certain if A.D. 8 was a leap year or not; and would you please provide an authoritative reference if you know of one?
Thank you.
