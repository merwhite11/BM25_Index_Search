What is the period of Jupiter being visible in the sky?

For more than 3 months now, we can enjoy seeing Jupiter in the sky, and this will be the case until end of December.
This means that Jupiter move slowly in the sky every day, but it makes me wonder when we'll be able to see it again after December 2020?
Or, put it differently: how long does it takes for Jupiter to do a full "rotation" in the sky?
Thank you !
