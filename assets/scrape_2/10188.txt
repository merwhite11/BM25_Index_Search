Was the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation originally gamma rays?

I believe that sometime after Big Bang the entire universe was filled with high energy particles. Now we fast forward to the present; most of these particles still linger and managed to avoid being absorbed, and also they lost quite a significant amount of energy and became today's "noise" which can be picked up by our TV antenna. Is this true, or am I mistaken?
