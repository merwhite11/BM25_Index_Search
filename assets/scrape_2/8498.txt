Near-future astronomic events that could threaten Earth

What kinds of astronomical events can pose a serious threat to life on Earth in the near future (1000-10,000 years). If there are none in the near future, when is the soonest event that is predicted to threaten life on Earth? 
I am ignorant about astrononomy and so far I have only thought of an asteroid collision, solar flares, and effects from the sun dying in several billion years (and a visit by some hostile aliens).
