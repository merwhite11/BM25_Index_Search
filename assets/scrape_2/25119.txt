What would a terraformed Mars look like from Earth?

Question in the title. Currently, Mars is a small orange dot in the sky. But what if green, blue, and some white were added? I wouldn't expect it to be too different- a large portion of it will remain pretty much the way it was, but with more snow (Tharsis bulge is REALLY high up).
