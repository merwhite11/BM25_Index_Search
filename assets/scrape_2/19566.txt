Are blue and red shift visible?

When looking into the sky at night using my bare eyes, I see that stars appear in different colors. From my understanding this is caused by different chemical compositions of those stars which show up in their spectral lines and therefore defining their color. 
Does blue and red shift visibly change the color perception when looked at the stars with your naked eye?
