With gravitational lensing, is it possible to mathematically compute the correct image of the galaxy that is being distorted?

There's been another report of gravitational lensing in the news.  Wikipedia has a good image of an example of gravitational lensing taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.  This brings me to wonder that, since they understand the math behind the lensing, shouldn't they be able to reconstitute the original image of the galaxy behind the galaxy that is acting as a lens?  That is, take the image and run it through a computer program that reconstructs the image using known parameters of the mass and the position of the lensing galaxy?
