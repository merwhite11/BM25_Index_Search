If Newton said a sphere acts as if its entire mass is at its center,why are there no black holes between any two ordinary stars of 4 Solar Masses?

A paper('A QuasiHeuristic View On The Occurrence Of Singularity Forms of Ordinary Matter') discussed at a recent colloqium at our institution postulated,since 4 Solar masses is what is needed for black hole formation ,then at the center of mass between 2 ordinary stars,each double the Sun in mass, there should always be a black hole.(There were also about five other consistent predictions)If we view a binary system of such stars 5 million kilometers apart,then the barycenter should be located at the point precisely  2.5 kilometers between the pair.This point should act as if there were a body of 4 Solar masses concentrated at it,and the stars orbit it.
Or Newton's theory has to be reviewed.So where are those 'ordinary' black holes out there?No mention I have seen of any yet
Note ;On submitting the paper to informal peer-review,most of the objections were about singularities depending crucially on density rather than just mass.Also,they said if this were the case,objects on earth would be attracted towards the Sun-Earth center-of-mass rather than to the Earth's center.The authors countered by saying
*The density requirement actually favours a barycenter.Between say, two ordinary stars of mass 2 Solar-Masses each(where a Solar Mass is the mass of the Sun),the barycenter of it simply is a point in space which acts as if 4 solar masses are concentrated there.Since points have no extension,there should result a situation of such density a singularity would appear.
*Objects on Earth should appear to be attracted to the Sun-Earth barycenter and fall towards/into it,but do not for the same reason the Earth doesn't;the objects together,with the Earth, are in orbit around it,so this vitiates the attraction of the barycenter .
Edit;The question is why these 'virtual' black holes are unobserved.If a gravitational system acts as if its entire mass(sum of the masses of its members) is concentrated at the barycenter,then what prevents a barycenter of sufficient mass from having the characteristics of a black hole/neutron star(event-horizon, et cetera)?To put it another way,is a barycenter of sufficient 'mass' distinguishable from a black hole of equal mass ?Are these barycentric/virtual singularities unobserved by noneexistence or simply by nobody looking out for them,since they are unexpected?
Note,as the authors wrote in their synopsis(and in the paper title,their paper is heuristic;they insist they are proposing something which should occur,and in its absence,a revision to conventional (Newtonian?)theory may be needed.Both authors,though physicists,have no actual physical experience at an observatory.
