Why is the L3 Lagrangian point not perfectly stable? And why is the Earth-Sun L3 point a bit less than one A.U.?

I suppose the answer might involve general relativity, but still....
The L4 and L5 points are considered, theoretically, long-term stable, but not L3, on the exact opposite side of the Sun... And it is not, apparently, located exactly one A.U. from the Sun, as one would assume....
