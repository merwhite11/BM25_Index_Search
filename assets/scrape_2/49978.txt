Is the Michael H. Hart range for the Habitable Zone (Goldlocks Zone) still used?

We're having an argument on another site about the Hart definition of the CHZ. In 1979, Hart provided a very conservative estimate of habitable zone: 0.958 - 1.004 AU. This was used to substantiate his rare Earth hypothesis. Is this range still relevant today. Certainly you can argue that NASA doesn't accept this definition.
NASA definition of the Goldilocks zone,

In our solar system, Earth sits comfortably inside the Sunâ€™s habitable zone. Broiling planet Venus is within the inner edge, while refrigerated Mars is near the outer boundary.

Mars's perihelion is far away at 1.3814 AU.
