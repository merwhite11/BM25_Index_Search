Calculate how many days left for synodic period from particular planet

One of the many tools used in Astronomy are the formulas used to determine Orbital Motion. There are two basic forms of orbits:

Sidereal Period
Synodic Period

For Jupiter:
$$\mathrm{\frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{E} - \frac{1}{S}}$$
where
P = sidereal period in both equations
S = synodic period in both equations
E = Earth's orbit in both equations
Synodic period in this case, for Jupiter is 398.88 days.
Query: Is there any formula to calculate how many days left for Jupiter to reach its next synodic period from Earth? or how many days left until Jupiter is in opposition?
