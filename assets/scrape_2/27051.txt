Would an analogue of the definition for planets also work for moons?

This is a follow up question to What exactly is a "moon"? The conclusions I draw from James K's answer is that the IAU should define what a moon is. They haven't done so yet, but they should.
The obvious way to go about defining "moon" would be to build on the definition of a planet:

Planets must be in orbit around the Sun
Planets must be round due to their own gravity
Planets must have "cleared the neighbourhood"

This immediately suggests the equivalent definition of a moon:

Moons must be in orbit around the host planet
Moons must have [minimum size]. Unfortunately being round doesn't work since not all moons are round (c.f. Mars' moons, unless one reclassifies those as not moons)
Moons must have "cleared the neighbourhood" of their own orbit, i.e. in their particular orbit around the host they are by far the most massive body

Would such a definition work? If so, why hasn't the IAU also defined moons? It seems so natural after all. If not, what's the catch?
