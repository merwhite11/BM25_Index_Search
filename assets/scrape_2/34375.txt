How can I get the exact time of each zodiac every year?

I want to make a calculator for Chinese New Year calendar. There is a rule that a leap year happens if the eclipse happens before each zongqi (equivalent to the middle of zodiac sign, ie. 15ยบ, 45ยบ, 75ยบ, 115ยบ... to the sun).
Where is a good reference to know that the exact time of the earth entering each zodiac sign every year?
