What weather is present in Jupiter's Great Red Spot?

What weather is present in Jupiter's Great Red Spot? Is it raining? Is it snowing?  There is definitely a hurricane a-blowing :-).  I know it is very cold, has extremely high winds and clouds of an orange/red color, and there is probably lightning.  I also know the gravity on Jupiter is strong, about 2.5x that of Earth.  Here is a similar question/answer that answers some of what I am looking for, but I still want to know if it is raining, snowing, etc...
I am making a level for Planetary Settlers that takes place in an air base trapped in the cloud tops of the Great Red Spot, and here is what I envision the red spot looking like so far (I am still working on adding the lightning): YouTube video of Jupiter Level Development.  I would like to know if I should add rain, snow, or any other unusual phenomenon present there.
