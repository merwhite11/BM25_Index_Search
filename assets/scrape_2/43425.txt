How hard is it to find the Sun's "sisters?"

As @ProfRob stated in his excellent answer regarding the ejection of the Solar System's fifth gas giant,

It is for similar reasons that, even though the Sun was probably born in a cluster of $\sim 10^4$ stars, none of those siblings have been firmly identified.

So why is it so difficult to find such stellar siblings?
NB: Maybe it's because open clusters tend to disassociate quickly and the stars would be scattered everywhere. But wouldn't stars with similar spectra, age, metallicity, etc. be found easily?
