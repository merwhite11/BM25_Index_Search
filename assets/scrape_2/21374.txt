Universe and black holes

I know that the radius of the observable universe is about 46.6 billion light years and is expanding at every instant of time due to dark energy . So is it possible that we our entire universe could be inside a black hole and that the edge of our observable universe represents the event horizon which in this case is expanding faster than the speed of light due to matter being constantly accreted inside it . Where that black hole is a part of another universe and that universe of another black hole and the pattern goes on . Is this possible ?
