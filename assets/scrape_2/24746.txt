How can I contribute to the scientific community using my telescope?

I've been using my Meade 90 ETX for a few years trying to become a better astronomer and am familiar enough with the basics to navigate my way around. I was wondering in what way an amateur astronomer such as myself can contribute to the scientific community. I would like to try and do more than just stargaze and take pictures.
