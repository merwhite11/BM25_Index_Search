Precise declination of Moon

The moon follows 5.14 deg inclined path. the ecliptic and the Moon's path coincide are called 'nodes', and they travel around the ecliptic in a period of 18.66 years.
Once every 18.66 years, the ascending node coincides with the vernal equinox, and the Moon will reach declinations of about +28° and -28° (much more than the Sun, which reaches ±23°); this is called a 'major lunar standstill'. 9.33 years later, the opposite is true, and the Moon will only reach ±18° during a 'minor lunar standstill'.
I read https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20121018091531AArHgNS&guccounter=1 here, the precise declination of moon is at +28.88 deg, over the earth. Where can I find the exact, value from other sources? I don't know how he found this value? "  I get plus or minus 28 degrees 53', over a 18.6 year cycle. Eventually it will cover the whole region, but it will take many thousands of years (depending on how close you consider it has to get to a point to cover it.) " 28 degrees and 53' = 28.88 deg 
The 0.88 deg, to time is 53 min, I think it seems to coincide with the fact the moon rises, 53 min sooner, over each day. Is this related to this? 13.2 deg * 4 min/deg = 53 min 
The maximum inclination of the moon, for standstill, can it be specified by the eclipse point? On, august 21 2017, an eclipse occurs in 28.88 deg on latitude point. Is this angle the same as the inclination angle specified here: http://www.umass.edu/sunwheel/pages/moonteaching.html - 28.8 deg.
I just want 28.88 deg = 28 deg 53' confirmed.
