Rotational speeds of the material forming planets should increase, not decrease

We know that planets form as a result of gaseous material revolving around a center of mass that froze to form planets. However shouldn't the angular speed of that matter increase as they go closer to the center to maintain the angular momentum? 
Why then the average rotational period of the external planets are faster than that for the terrestrial planets?
