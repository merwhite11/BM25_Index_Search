Using setting circle for Right Ascension

I'm a little bit confused about the setting circle of my EQ5 mount. Basically, I'm trying to find M42 nebula using Sirius star as reference. So, considere that I did the following steps:
A) Polar aligned for south pole
B) Pointed the telescope to Sirius star
C) Adjusted the RA wheel to 6h45m and DEC wheel to -16ยบ42'

Now, I want to view the M42 nebula basing only in the RA and DEC wheels (without using the finderscope or whatever). 
Then, I did:
D) Changed the coordinates in the EQ5 mount to match RA 5h35m and DEC -5ยบ23
E) Spent 5 minutes performing the step above (D)
F) Looked in the eyepiece

So my questions are: 
1) After doing all these steps above, will the M42 nebula be 5 minutes away from the center of my eyepiece? So instead of using RA 5h35m I will need to use RA 5h40m?(??)
2) If yes, will I need to perform all the above steps every time that I want to see a new object? I mean, as fast as I can, to minimize the RA error...
3) And if the answer is yes again to Question (2), how useful is the setting circle under these conditions for you?
I will appreciate any kind of help.
