Do the actual false colours in the M87 black hole picture convey information?

As for the title. The picture could have been plotted in grey scale, B&W, whatever couple of colours, or perhaps using a window of wavelength in order to show shift of the Doppler/relativistic Doppler kind.
Discarding the obvious dark, shall the picture be watch at merely in term of brightness, or considering yellow and red as well? 
And independently, why those colours have been choose?  Just an aesthetic and suggestive choice, or that should be the apparent image as seen by eyes if we could go there? 
I resume: is the picture a radio waves intensity or brightness map, or conversely a kind of "as it would be" picture in the Vis (modelled from the behaviour of the collected radio waves and theories)?
