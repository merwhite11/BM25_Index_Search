Can the gravitational redshift of our sun be measured?

How much of a wavelength change does our sun’s gravity cause in the light it emits? I imagine this could be measured by the shift in its spectral lines. And by extension, does the earth’s gravitational field cause a minuscule blue shift- or does this add a bit more redshift?
