extracting visibility information from CASA measurement set

I am trying to export the UV wavelengths, visibilities and weights from a measurement set in CASA, but I haven't been able to find the right commands to do this.
'exportuvfits' might be what I am looking for, but I can't find a clear explanation of what this format really is.
Any CASA users out there that can help me?
