How to show that $P_c=(9GM^2)/(14\pi R^4)$ from equation of hydrostatic equilibrium

I need to show that $$P_c=\frac {9GM^2}{14\pi R^4}$$
from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium: $\frac {dP}{dr}=-\frac{GM\rho}{r^2}$
in the exercise before, we show that $\rho_c=\frac {6M}{5 \pi R^3}$

if I use this, and the fact that I know that $\frac{dP}{dr}$ can be exchanged with $-\frac{P_c}{R}$ we get:

$P_c=\frac{6GM^2}{5 \pi R^5}$
This is where I get stuck. I'm not really sure on where to go from this.
