I spotted a very small, quite foggy but uniform aurora-type looking green light in the sky, but I live near the equator

I live in India, from there, a few years(2016) ago, I had spotted quite bright, uniformly(didn't change the shape while moving) crystal shaped green light very slowly moving above the clouds during the time 19:00-19:05 or so. That was very gas like(faint at the borders), rather than a solid green light, and I was 'convinced' I had seen aurora lights, but then I read they can not reach my area(equator), and are not so small. Very small but slightly broader than what ISS would look from the same place(earth) naked eye'd. It was on the top of the sky, and not at all near the horizon. I researched on Google, it didn't help much. I first read it could have been something like STEVE, but it was right above the head and not near the horizon as I wrote. I am really curious of what it could have been. I know it is nearly impossible to accurately tell what it was, given it was 4-5 years ago, so I just want the 'possibilities' of what it COULD'VE been. Hope anyone answers.
