Can Pluto and Neptune collide anytime in future?

We know that, the orbit of pluto ambiguously cuts the orbit of Neptune. I want to know, whether the revolving speed of Neptune is equal to the revolving speed of pluto. If not, is there a possibility in future,  that the two planets, or rather two celestial bodies will collide in future?
