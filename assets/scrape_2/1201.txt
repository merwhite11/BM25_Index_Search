What was the length of year 1 million years back?

We know that the universe is gradually expanding and this indirectly means that the gravitational force between sun, earth, planets and other stars (roughly anything in the universe) is gradually decreasing as gravitational force is indirectly proportional to square of distance between the objects.
So I think this also effects to length of the year. If yes then is it possible to know how days does 1 year had 1 million year back?
