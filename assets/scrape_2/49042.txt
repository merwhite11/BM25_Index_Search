How to choose eyepieces and other accessories for a Celestron 70mm f/5.7 portable refractor?

I have a Celestron Specialty Series Travel Scope 70mm refractor which came with 10mm (40x) and 20mm (20x) eyepieces.
Specifications:

Focal ratio: f/5.71
Optical Design: Refractor
Aperture (mm): 70 mm
Focal length: 400 mm
Finderscope: 5x24
Highest Useful Magnification: 165x
Lowest Useful Magnification: 10x
Resolution (Rayleigh): 1.99 arc seconds
Resolution (Dawes): 1.66 arc seconds
Light Gathering Power (Compared to human eye): 100x
Optical Coatings: Fully Coated

Iâ€™m looking for the best possible magnifications and combinations that would lemme look at planets and deep sky objects more clearly.
I'll soon be moving to a town-city area (Needham, MA) if that is of concern for location.
Can someone help me understand how to choose the eyepieces and accessories that I could buy?
Thanks
