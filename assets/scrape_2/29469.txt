Is it possible to see a spacecraft orbiting the moon with a pair of binoculars?

On this clear early morning over London, I was studying the moon with a pair of binoculars and noticed a tiny dot of light that appeared to trace a slow orbit around the moon. I reckon it moved roughly 30 degrees in as many minutes. I'm wondering whether I was seeing a star or if it's remotely possible that I was seeing sunlight reflecting off an orbiting craft? Although the sky was clear it certainly wasn't starry; it was about 100 minutes before sunrise.
