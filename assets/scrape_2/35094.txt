How strong are the strongest Ioquakes?

Jupiter's moon Io is the most geologically active celestial body in our system. It has the strongest volcanoes and quakes. Of course in practice these quakes wouldn't be as dangerous as on Earth for someone on the surface due to Io's low surface gravity (0.183 g). Let's ignore that however, do we know some of the strongest Ioquakes, what would be their magnitude on the Richter scale?
