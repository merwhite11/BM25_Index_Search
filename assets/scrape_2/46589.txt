How well defined are the elemental shells in evolved stars?

Most textbooks and popular science show highly evolved massive stars with an onion-like structure with layers or shells of different elements fusing. This is clearly approximate (as noted in the comments here), but how approximate is it?
It would seem to me that even in a non-convective environment there would be significant diffusion over stellar timescales that would mix the layers, perhaps into a soft distribution with higher probability of finding heavy elements deeper. But what does actual models and simulations say?
