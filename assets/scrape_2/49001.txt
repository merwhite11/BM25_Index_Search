How new is this crater?

I've been looking at HiRISE images, and this description says that this crater is new, which is why we can see the bright ejecta. How long does it typically take for the bright ejecta to erode away? What does "new" mean in this context? Was the crater formed a few days before the picture? A few years? Centuries?
