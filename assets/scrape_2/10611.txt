Would dark energy save the earth for a while as the sun heats up?

Would the expansion of space (e.g. dark energy) move the earth further away from the sun over time, possibly saving us for perhaps a few billion years as the sun heats up?
Scientists now tend to think that the sun is heating up very gradually (e.g. over billions of years):

Dark energy is the unexplained accelerating expansion of the universe, as described here:

Put another way, my question is, is dark energy working at such a rate that it would move earth (and other planets) further from the sun and prolong life on earth as the sun heats up?
