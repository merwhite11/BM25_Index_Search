Telescope/s functioning from underground mines

Theoretically and Practically,
Can a Telescope function for the astronomer observed from underground mines? By "telescope" I mean the instrument used by astronomers to observe stars, planets etc in the solar system.
The answer could be some Telescopes might, some may not
Or
Any Telescope will not be useful to the Underground miner.
