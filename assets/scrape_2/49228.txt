Where can I find galaxy rotational data?

I want to do a small project of generating rotational curves for different galaxies, and need data for some prominent stars in other galaxies (data needed: distance from center, rotational velocity) to generate basic rotational curves.
Where can I get this? I found this resource: NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database, but there's no rotational data for stars (at least I can't find)
