Occultations of Triton

I've been listening to an episode of the "NASA in Silicon Valley" podcast about the SOFIA mission.
One of the techniques they use at SOFIA is stellar occultations to study different objects.
My impression was that the occultations by Pluto happen much more often than by Triton. Is this true and why is that?
