Is there any ephemeris generator that gives you accurate distances between Earth and other bodies?

I've tried JPL's HORIZONS ephemeris generator and while it gives accurate celestial coordinates for an object it doesn't give the geocentric distance.
JPL's Solar System Simulator gives the distance to an object at a certain time however only down to a few digits.
Is there an accurate tool that generates exact (meaning down to the meter) geocentric distances between Earth and another Solar System body over increments of time?
