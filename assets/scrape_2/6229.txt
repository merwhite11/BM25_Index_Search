Why aren't the farthest objects close to each other?

The last years we find some objects like this : MACS0647-JD which are more than 13 billion light-years away from us. 
This means that the picture we get was created only some million years after the Big Bang.
Why can we see objects like this in all directions? Shouldn't those objects be close to each other?
