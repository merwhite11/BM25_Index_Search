What actually are line-driven winds?

I have read several books (viz. intro to stellar winds)/articles about stellar winds (dust-driven, line-driven, coronal winds), but still didn't understand the explanation. I understand that line-driven winds occur in hot and high-mass stars, but I have no idea why is it called "Line-Driven", what does the word "line" mean?
