Current topics on Radio Astronomy and looking for advice

Background and Question: I'm an undergraduate student interested on Radio Astronomy. I consider myself enthusiastic about it and I project myself following this "path" so I'd like, apologizing myself if this is a naive question, to ask you, more experienced astronomers, what are the current topics being part of research in Radio Astronomy.
My thoughts:

I know Cosmology and CMB Measurements are something that will keep its route for a long time as huge projects continue being developed.
Also I'd say Radio-loud Galaxies are something that Radio Astronomers are putting lots of work into.
Interferometric techniques, data reduction algorithms and image synthesis.
Astro-Chemistry and the study of spectral lines using data cubes such as provided by ALMA.

More questions:

Am I wrong with any of the topics listed? What else is being done now?
How do you see this in the next 5 - 10 - 20 years ?
Considering I want to work on my thesis project this year, what would you recommend (or to other undergrad. students) ? What would be a "good route" to follow after graduating? (my grades to this date are at ~ 80%).
