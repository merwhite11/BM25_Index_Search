How is asteroidal rock formed?

So when planets form, dust from the protoplanetary nebula gets collected by gravity and then heated and reformed under pressure until it forms dense masses of stuff which we call rock.
However, asteroids don't have nearly enough gravity to do this, but pictures of asteroids like Bennu still show sizeable boulders on their surface. I'm aware that some asteroids are formed from fragments knocked off actual planets, but isn't that a tiny proportion of the whole? I'd expect asteroids to be made out of fluffy dust lightly sintered together from vacuum welding, but that's not what we see. Why?
