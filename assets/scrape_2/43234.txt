Has a gravitational microlensing event ever been predicted? If so, has it been observed?

This answer to Are astronomers waiting to see something in an image from a gravitational lens that they've already seen in an adjacent image? describes "Deja vu all over again" (SN "Refsdal"); after multiple gravitationally lensed images of a supernova were observed with different path lengths an shifted light curves, one more "echo" was predicted then indeed was later observed.
While that's a rarity, occultations of objects by other objects are regularly predicted, and some of the nearer objects are pretty far, at least in the Kuiper belt. But alas they are not usually very massive.
Gravitational microlensing events are defined by a peak in a light curve rather than a measurable deflection. From How are microlensing events used to constrain the size of innermost stable circular orbits around spinning black holes?:
