How big can a rocky planet get?

If I get the numbers right, at about 17 Jupiter masses a mainly gaseous planet would ignite into some type of star. What about rocky planets? Is there a theoretical limit to their size, so that they can grow up to size x? (I'm imagining a "liquid" planet would congeal into rock after certain gravity value, and would somehow fit into the "rocky class" as well).
