Where can we find astronomical real world data (spectral radiance and wavelength particularly) of a star?

I have my college project and I thought of finding the temperature of a star with the black-body curve of star but i need real data.
I searched but can't find the thing what I want. all I am getting is ready-made graphs of it.
I need the datas in numbers and not just graphs.
