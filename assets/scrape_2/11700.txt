Were parts of the Universe deflating during Inflation?

I was reading about the history of the early universe in Carroll & Ostlie and specifically looking at Inflation, which, as I understand, occurred because our [observable] part of the universe entered a false vacuum state containing negative pressures, thus fueling expansion. (Carroll & Ostlie state the opposite, but as per the discussion below, that appears to be incorrect). 
Does that mean that there are other parts of the Universe (outside of our horizon) that experienced deflation, as inflationary parts pressed against them? Would there be boundaries between separate parts of the larger universe where inflationary parts encounter one another? Any thoughts on what those parts of the Universe are like, such as containing their own CMB that's NOT close to uniform, or where there is a much higher density of matter?
