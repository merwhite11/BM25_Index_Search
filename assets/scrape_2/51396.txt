What kind of effects would two moons have on an earthlike planet?

On Earth our moon has several effects: it generates two high and two low tides a day; it slows down the spin of the planet and stabilizes its wobble, etc.

So, what possible effects could two moons, roughly half the size of our own, have on an earth-sized planet with continents and oceans similar to ours?
Also, would these moons eventually collide with each other, or is there a scenario in which both could co-exist peacefully? Would they be tidally locked?
