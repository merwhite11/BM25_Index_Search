Single axis solar tracker tilt angle calculation

I'm working on single axis solar tracker project. Solar panels will towards the sun with maximum angle from sunrise to sunset. the panel direction is east-west or near east-west. I need to make angle formula that can give optimum angle in a day between sun and panel. I'm using NREL solar position algorithm document to calculate angles. I don't understand how to formulate tilt angle. Ä°f i choose direction east-west, can I use directly hour angle for tilt angle? Is it enough to calculate tilt angle using zenith and azimuth angle?
