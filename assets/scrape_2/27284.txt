What is the meaning of "bright unresolved sources"

In many articles talking about telescopes, they talk often of "bright, unresolved sources".
"bright" usually mean that the magnitude should be less than a certain threshold, (or that the signal to noise ratio should bigger than a given value) but what I don't catch the meaning of "unresolved".
For example :
"unresolved sources" in https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/LPM-17/LSSTSRD_v5%202%203.pdf
"bright unresolved point sources" in the introduction of this paper : https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Publication-86/
Any idea ?
