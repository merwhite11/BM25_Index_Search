How to take into account the filter response in thermal and reflected flux density calculations?

I'm using python to calculate the thermal and reflected flux densities of a faceted asteroid model, where both equations have the Planck function present in them.
Currently, I'm integrating the Planck function over the bandpass of the filter. For instance, using the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC channel 2 filter, I'm integrating it with an effective wavelength of 4.493 microns with a bandwidth of 1.010 microns. Is this correct way to do it, given this filter has a top-hat filter distribution?
For the case, of the reflected flux density, I'm integrating it with the bandpass of the Johnson standard V filter with an effective wavelength of 0.551 microns and a bandwidth of 88 microns. However, this V filter has Gaussian looking distribution. How do I take this into account?
