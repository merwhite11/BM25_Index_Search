How close to Earth were the asteroids moving through this Hubble composite image?

Recently Hubble saw several asteroids traveling erratically through a deep field perspective. 
What region of the sky is this, and how near were these asteroids to the Earth?
The photo is composed of multiple shots and the asteroids have copies because of Hubble's movement through frames as the photo assemblage shifted.

Was Hubble viewing towards the plane of the solar system and the asteroid belt?
How did they explain that there were five in the same narrow frame?
