Can we observe the same very old object more than once?

Assuming the universe is curved and that is it possible to travel in a straight line and return to your starting point, it would make sense that at a younger age when the universe was smaller that light from an object sent in opposite directions would eventually reach the opposite "pole".  Do we see any possibilities of this?  Seeing the same object from opposite sides in opposite sides of the sky?  Such object would have to be very old, I know.
