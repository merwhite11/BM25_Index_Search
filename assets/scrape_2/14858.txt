Tripod mount missing!

I have received a new Celestron Powerseeker 127 (a 5' short Newtonian), however it came without a tripod mount. 
Ideas or suggestions on how to procure the right mount our a suitable alternative would be most welcome.
I am looking for sourcing tips rather than advice on how to choose a tripod.
