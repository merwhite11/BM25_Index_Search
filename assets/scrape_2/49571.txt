Is there a website or app that can add declination and RA grid to an existing photo?

For a few years now, I've been shooting photos of the night sky with just a tripod and my Nikon DSLR.  After extensive post-processing to mitigate light pollution, I usually submit the final results to nova.astrometry.net for constellation diagrams and labels.  For basic orientation this works very well, but not for judging how well my camera is picking up the faintest stars.  The difficulty is that in trying to compare my photo with an app like Sky Safari or Stellarium, I can usually look at either the app or my photo, but not both at the same time.  In switching from one view to the other, I "lose my place", as it were.  Moreover, unlike most terrestrial map tools, apps like Stellarium generally don't allow you to arbitrarily rotate the display, so a constellation might be lying sideways in my photo but standing upright in Stellarium.  (I know, I could rotate my photo display, but that's not always convenient, either.)
Obviously, a grid of celestial coordinates would be a huge help here.  Is there an app or website that can do this?  How about if one can identify some known stars in the photo?
