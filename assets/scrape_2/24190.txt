Telescope light gathering power and resolution

I'm a little confused. Could you help me?
The question is: if we increase the radius of a telescope twice, how much does the light gathering power change? What about resolution?
Does it increase 22-fold?
For second part, I know as the diameter of the telescope's objective increases, the resolving power increases.
