Theoretical limits for natural satellites having natural satellites

Is there an inherent instability or limit that prevents natural satellites like the moons of Jupiter from having their own natural satellites?
I looked at other questions such as do moons have moons but they focus on discovery rather than theoretical limits analogous to the Roche limit for satellite formation.
