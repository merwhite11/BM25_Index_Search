Is the local group bound to the Virgo cluster?

The Virgo Cluster is currently red-shifted by 0.003 according to Wikipedia; this indicates that the cluster is expanding. Will the cluster's enormous gravity eventually "win" and pull the milky way/local group back toward itself, or will our current recessional velocity combined with dark energy cause us to recede off to infinity?
