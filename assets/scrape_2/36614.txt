Has the permittivity or the permeability of space been measured in a gravitational well?

Technically one might say yes since earth is gravitational well. However I am looking for more data points. For example,

in deep space where voyager might be

at the Lagrange points of massive bodies where gravitational fields are in equilibrium

at the bottom of a deep well like Jupiter


The intuition behind this question is the compactification of space that is caused by gravity. Certainly time slows in a gravitational well. And since c is constant, distances are relatively smaller. Please note I am not asking about em waves nor their velocity. Rather the distribution of field lines vs distance from a charge, a moving charge or a magnet.
