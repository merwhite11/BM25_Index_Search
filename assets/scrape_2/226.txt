Why does the Moon seem larger when it is close to the horizon?

I've noticed that when I look into the sky at night, sometimes the moon appears very large near the horizon. Sometimes it also looks like it has a yellow tint. 

Is this the light rays bouncing off the moon differently, or the atmosphere of the earth, or some type of sunspot blocking part of the light to the moon?
