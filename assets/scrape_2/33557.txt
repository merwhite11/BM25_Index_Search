Why is a giant planet around a tiny star unusual when binary stars are common?

Inspired by this BBC article and the corresponding journal article about the M dwarf star GJ 3512.

The Jupiter-like world is unusually large compared with its host star, contradicting a widely held idea about the way planets form.

On the other hand, binary stars are very common, comprising (according to Wikipedia) about one third of star systems.  
Naively, the same processes that create binary star systems could be expected to also create star systems comprised of a single star and a Jupiter-like "failed star" - the only difference being that in the latter case the would-be second star wasn't large enough to ignite.
What is the difference between these scenarios?  What makes the small-star-and-large-planet, according to the standard models of planet formation, unlikely, when binary stars are common?
