Why can't we see a solar eclipse every month?

In every lunar revolution around Earth, the Moon is at a point between the Earth and the Sun. Then why can't we see a solar eclipse once every lunar month?
Is it because of a tilted orbit of the Moon around the Earth? Is the orbit of the Moon some kind of a sphere?
