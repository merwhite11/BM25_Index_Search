How is space-time bent by black holes?

I just read When a star becomes a black hole, does its gravitational power become stronger? and it confused me a bit;
I always thought black holes are supermassive and that is why they bend space-time. But it is said therein that the black hole is less massive than the star that created it (and it seems logical if we think about that - indeed, the star exploded and released a lot of matter). 
Thus my question: How can a black hole bend space-time more than the star which created it?
