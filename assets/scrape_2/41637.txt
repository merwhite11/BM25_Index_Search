Elongated Moon crater statistics?

Many craters on Moon have circular shape as a result of the explosion upon impact. I got interested in oblong craters created by impacts striking the surface at a very low angle. Is there any statistics on the number of elongated craters on the Moon available?
An article on an Oval Crater captured by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter states:

Non-circular (oval or elliptical) impact craters can form when the impacting bolide trajectory to the surface is <15° from horizontal or when the bolide impacts a sloped region on the (or some combination of both factors).

How well-studied is that threshold impact angle? Is there a phase transition from no explosion if below 15°, to explosion if impact angle is steeper?
