Night sky timelapse - SO MANY METEORS?

I have really little knowledge of Astronomy in general. Last Monday, I tested my new camera by doing a Night-Sky timelapse. After a little post-processing, i noticed dozens of light streaks going in all directions. 
I can't tell if those are meteors, airplanes or satelites. 
Could you help me out? This is the video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/y4jfiua8blzanpe/test2.2_h264-420_1080p_25_MQ.mp4?dl=0
