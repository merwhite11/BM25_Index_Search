derivation of reduced magnitude of asteroids

I've noticed that there is this parameter called reduced absolute magnitude $V(\alpha)$ and it is defined as below according to the paper by Mahlke et al. 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2020.114094
$V(\alpha) = m + 5 log (r\Delta) $
, where where $r$ is the distance between the asteroid and the Sun at the epoch of observation and $Δ$ the respective distance between the asteroid and Earth, $m$ is the observed apparent magnitude, according to the authors. $V(\alpha)$ is referred to as the phase curve, and, by definition, $H = V(0)$, observed at a phase angle of 0° at 1 AU from both Earth and Sun.
I've tried to find the the derivation of this equation, and haven't succeeded yet. I've also referred the absolute magnitude of solar system bodies given in the the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude and could not find the derivation of the above equation.
Can anyone point me to the right direction please?
Thanks !
