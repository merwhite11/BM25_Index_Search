Information Paradox with Hawking's Radiation

A theory about Blackholes storing the information from the universe.
Being said that Blackholes are condensed mass sufficient enough to break every particle into different elementary particles, broken particles will eventually reach the center(or they break down the time they reach there).
Some say that the information is stored on the surface instead, which can be carried by the Hawking's Radiation.
Questions:

How exactly can Hawking's Radiation carry the information?
How is it possible for information to exist at the event horizon? 

(If the mass was swallowed by the blackholes then every single particle should be inside the event horizon as they brought towards the black hole at very high velocity and it's becoming difficult to imagine that some particles were left at the horizon itself).
Maybe: If the information is on the event Horizon then it might not have broken to elementary particles!
