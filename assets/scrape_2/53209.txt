"Tidally locked" Oort Cloud object

Is the Oort cloud spherical enough and are there enough objects in it that it is likely there is at least one in there that it has shown the same face to the sun for billions of years and will continue to do so for billions of years? Just based on chance spin axis and rate?
Don't know why I am wondering what the most distant "tidally locked" body is... I like using things like this to give some context to the scale of things...
