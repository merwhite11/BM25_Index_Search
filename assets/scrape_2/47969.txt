Orbital terminology for satellites relative to one another

Basic question, but I'm trying to describe a planetary system and coming up short on vocabulary. Do either of the following exist?:

A word for the closest pass between two satellites orbiting the
same body. "Periapsis" does not seem to be appropriate as it
describes a specific point in a single body's orbit. Either a
specific word for this phenomenon or a general word for the closest
pass between any two bodies would be welcomed.

A word for the period between these events, adjacent to the concept
of lunation.
