Best lens for a beginner

Just bought a Celestron StarSense Explorer DX 130AZ for my son.  What is the best lens to use for viewing planets?  What are some easy tips for him, to help explorer his passion?  He has the 25mm and the 10mm lens that came with it.  I also bought him the Celestron 8mm-24mm lens.  Any advise would be greatly appreciated.....  Also, what would he need to be able to take pictures of things he is looking at? Or is this even possible with this telescope?
