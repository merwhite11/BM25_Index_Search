Find a planet with incomplete information of a star chart

I am wondering why it was so hard to locate Luke in Star Was Episode 7, if you already have the small part of the map.
Suppose we have a sector of our galaxy that roughly equals the one missing in this image. (I found no image on the web of the part in question. In the movie version on netflix you can take good look at it at 52:56.) 
Is it possible and how hard would it be to identify a planet within that part of the map, given our knowledge of our galaxy and

we only know the small part and have no information about its size.
there might be "landmarks" (planets, stars, nebulars, and the like) missing.

If it is not possible, what minimum requirements would have to be met (on the available equipment, the map, our knowledge, ..) to make it possible?
Please note: this is not a Star Wars question, that is just the motivation.
About which galaxies do we have enough knowledge to be able to do this?
