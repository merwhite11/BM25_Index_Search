Is it possible to know if a planet is located in the Habitable Zone knowing it's properties?

Is there an equation that can give me the possibile distance of the planet from his star knowing planet's temperature (or other datas)? 
I found this method for calculating the Habitable Zone but it's based only on star's properties.
