Which planet is this (if any)?

I live in Ahmedabad, in India, with an exact location of about 27.2048° N, 77.4975° E. Currently (as of this writing), it is 20:52 EST. I noticed a red object in the sky.


(Forgive the crude imaging. I took this with my phone camera.)
Now, the brighter object is the moon, and the less shiny object is the red one I saw. I read somewhere that Mars would be visible right now, as it is closer to the Earth.
I also read that Mars and Jupiter appear red, with Jupiter slightly dimmer.
I wanted to know whether the object I just saw was indeed a planet. If so, which one (and how can I identify them)? Or is it just another star that I spotted?
