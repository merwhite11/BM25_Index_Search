Can lunar atmospheric density, as it exists today, increase naturally?

Are there any mechanisms which could increase the density of the moon's atmosphere.
The moon's existing atmosphere is exceeding rare, with about 1 000 000 molecules of gas per cubic centimeter at the surface, ten trillion times less than the Earth. 
The source of this gas is the impact of solar wind on the moon's surface, and some outgassing from the interior of the moon. 
Can this density vary significantly? Could it reach a density comparable to Earth's? Are there natural processes which could cause the atmospheric density to increase, either in the short term, or over a longer time span.
