Is there a plausible causal mechanism to explain why the Sun would be heating up faster/ sooner than we thought? Question for a novel

I am writing a novel about what it will be like on earth 500 or so years before the death of our Sun. The Sun is heating up gradually and one day that will negatively affect life on Earth. I know that we are a long ways away from the heat being to much to permit life though. That being said, the novel is more about the social/political/religious ramifications of living in such a time. I still am very interested in making it as relatable and understandable as possible.
Is there any causal mechanism (hypothetically or imaginatively possible) that could cause the sun to heat up faster than it is at present? This could be internal (something collapses and the increase in core pressure speeds up the reaction rate of hydrogen fusion) or external (something impacts the sun with enough extra mass to increase net g, thus increasing pressure in the core).
If not a causal mechanism, maybe something you can think of that current science/ scientists could have missed/ aren't taking into account in their models that, if true, would mean the sun is going to be much hotter, much sooner than we thought.
Thank you so much for your help! I am pretty passionate about writing and I am only an amateur in the subject of astronomy. I'm hoping some brilliant minds can help me flesh out this idea to make it more concrete.
