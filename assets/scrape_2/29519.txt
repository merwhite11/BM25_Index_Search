Can two planets in an empty universe meet/be pulled together?

For this question assume that the entire universe is completely empty. The universe is not expanding or contracting, it is completely motionless since time immemorial and has never moved before.
Only two identical earths without moon are left in this entire universe and they are 5 billion light years apart. From their starting position the earths do not spin or move at all they are completely motionless.
Would these planets ever meet or at least be pulled together?  Or are the their respective gravities too small to have any meaningful effect?
