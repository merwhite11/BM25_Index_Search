Happy lunar new year! When will "sunset" happen for Chang'e-4 and Yutu-2?

Firecrackers all night and all libraries being closed here are two good indicators to a nerd like me that Lunar New Year has come again, and that means that it's the beginning of a lunar month and new Moon as seen from Earth.
That also means that the Chinese lander Chang'e-4 and rover Yutu-2 should be in sunlight since they are on the far side of the Moon. 
What phases of the Moon as seen from Earth correspond to times of sunrise and sunset for those two?
