What is the highest resolution image of the moon taken from Earth's surface?

According to this article:
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/26/star-spotted-speeding-near-milky-way-black-hole-for-first-time
the Very Large Telescope is "powerful enough to see a tennis ball on the moon from Earth".  I guess that the moon is much to bright and moves too fast for the VLT to take good pictures of it, but it got me wondering: what is the most magnified picture of the moon ever taken from Earth?
