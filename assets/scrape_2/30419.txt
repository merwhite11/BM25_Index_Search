Do the "schwarzschild metric" or the "isotropic metric" fit the Event Horizon telescope data on Messier 87 better?

The "Schwarzschild solution" in "Schwarzschild metric" looks like:
$$\text -c^2d\tau^2=-\left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)c^2dt^2+\left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta\,d\phi^2)$$
Using this metric you get certain values for the radius of the "Schwarzschild radius", the "photon sphere" and the "least stable circular orbit", among other things. When the Jet Propulsion Laboratory or other institutions are dealing with orbital dynamics in the solar system, they instead use the "isotropic metric" or at least a first order expansion of the isotropic metric to calculate relativistic effects on the orbits. Now the Schwarzschild solution in isotropic coordinates looks like:
$$ -c^2d\tau^2 = -\left(\frac{1-GM/2rc^2}{1+GM/2rc^2}\right)^2c^2dt^2 +(1+GM/2rc^2)^4[dr^2 +r^2( d\theta^2 +\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)]$$
Now in isotropic coordinates the "Schwarzschild radius", the "photon sphere", the "least stable circular orbit" among other things take other values. 
Question 1: Now that we have the measurements from the "Event Horizon Telescope" on the black hole, can something be said about what coordinates that fits the data better?
Question 2: It might be that both metrics fit the data equally well if we change the mass of the central black hole. Do we get different values on the mass of the central black hole if we fit the data using the isotropic coordinates instead of the Schwarzschild coordinates?

According to the Schwarzschild solution in Schwarzschild coordinates the photon sphere is located at an "r-parameter" of $3GM/c^2$. According to this post when using the Schwarzschild solution in Schwarzschild coordinates the apparent radius ($r_{obs}$) of something residing in a spherically symmetric gravitational potential when viewed from infinity is: $$r_{obs}=r(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2})^{-0.5} $$
According to this formula we will observe the photon sphere at a radial distance of $r_{obs}=3\sqrt{3}GM/c^2$. Now I assume astronomers estimate the  "observed radial distance", "$r_{obs}$" from the center of the M87 black hole to the photon sphere around the M87 black hole by measuring the angular size of the observed ring together with some estimate of the distance from earth to M87. If you use the formula for the photon sphere radius in Schwarzschild coordinates together with the formula for gravitational lensing enlargement you end up with a formula for the central mass of M87 as: $M=\frac{r_{obs}c^2}{{G3\sqrt{3}}}$.
Now if isotropic coordinates are used instead you will get another expression for the "r-parameter" of the photon sphere (I do not know what that expression looks like) and another expression for the "gravitational lensing enlargement effect" that makes objects in a spherically symmetric gravitational field look larger when observed from infinity.
What i specifically would like to know in the second question above is how much the mass of the central body will "change" if you keep $r_{obs}$ constant but you use isotropic coordinates instead of Schwarzschild coordinates and in both cases equate the "r-coordinate" with radial distance.

I am a bit confused about the concept that you can do various coordinate transformations of the "r-parameter" in the Schwarzschild solution and still get a solution that fits reality.
