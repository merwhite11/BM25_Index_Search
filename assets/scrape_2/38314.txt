Why is our heliosphere an asymmetric croissant shape?

The big, recent astronomy news about our heliosphere's asymmetric croissant shape has me confused....
Some articles mention the influence on our solar system's outermost boundary of very hot cations, and since positive charges are affected differently by magnetic fields than negative ones, maybe this is the reason....
Or maybe we live in a weird part of the Galaxy?
Perhaps no one knows yet, and I'm getting too excited here.....
