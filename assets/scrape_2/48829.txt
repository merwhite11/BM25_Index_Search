Do circa 1 THz radio telescope front end amplifiers actually down convert before amplifying? At what frequency does amplification become untenable?

A discussion of how astronomers view where "radio" ends and "infrared" begins under What does the celestial sphere look like in thermal IR? led me to wonder just how high of a frequency is currently electronically amplified in radio telescopes before it is instead down-converted via some local oscillator and mixer.
Just for example ALMA has ten different frequency bands listed at ESO's ALMA Receiver Bands.
The table says that the lowest two bands (35–50 and 65–90 GHz) use High-electron-mobility transistor receiver technology, while the top eight use "SIS".
The top band (Band 10) is listed as 0.3–0.4 mm or 787–950 GHz with a Noise Temperature Specification of 344 Kelvin.
But I don't know how to find out for each of these bands how the front ends work; whether they amplify or mix and down-convert first. So I'd like to ask:
Question: Do circa 1 THz radio telescope front end amplifiers actually down convert before amplifying? At what frequency does amplification become untenable for radio astronomy applications?
