What caused gravitational waves detected by LIGO?

I understand that in recent discovery gravitational waves have been detected. But knowing space time is not static it probably changes constantly in many places in the universe due to changes in distribution of massive bodies. For example, could the detected wave just be a slight oscillation in Gravity due to Jupiter fly by, or moon, or something similar?
