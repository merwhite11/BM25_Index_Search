My local night sky is so bright that I can only see the Moon, so would a low-cost telescope be any use?

Light pollution is so bad near our home that we can't see anything other the Moon in the night sky. For instance there is a street light on all night right in our lane and there are many other housing lights in the area.
Am I right to think that with a low-end telescope I won't be able to see anything else besides the Moon?
