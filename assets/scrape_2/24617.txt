Supernova in Hertzsprung–Russell diagram

If you could put a supernova in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Where would it be? Would it be near the white dwarfs or near the super giants?
I know that a supernova isn't a star but rather the explosion of a star, but if you technically could. Where would it be located?
Thanks!
