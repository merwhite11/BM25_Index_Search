Can matter leave the cosmic horizon?

Cosmic horizon in the de Sitter space is a sphere, centered at the observer with finite radius where the red shift due to cosmic expansion becomes infinite.
Given that no information can be transmitted from behind the cosmic horizon, I wonder whether any matter can ever pass behind the event horizon, because this will give rise to an information paradox, similar to the black hole information paradox.
The matter approaching the cosmic horizon seems to experience time dilation, so will that time dilation prevent it from crossing the horizon?
To work around the paradox, one have to postulate that the information about outgoing matter should be encoded in the de Sitter radiation.
