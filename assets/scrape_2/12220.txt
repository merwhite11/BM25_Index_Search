Could an asteroid knock the moon out of its orbit?

As describe in this CNN article, an asteroid is going to pass near the Earth on Halloween.
The article says that 

As it misses Earth by about 300,000 miles (slightly farther away than the moon), the asteroid, named 2015 TB145, will be visible to those with good telescopes

and that

It's a good thing it will miss, though. The asteroid is estimated to be 300 to 600 meters wide and traveling at 78,000 mph.

If, hypothetically, this asteroid actually hit the moon, could it knock it out of orbit? How about another, contrived asteroid with whatever properties are needed?
To be clear, when I say "out of its orbit" I'm including both the orbit decaying and the moon crashing into Earth, and the moon being knocked out into space away from the Earth's influence. Either would do.
