Do Schwarzschild black holes exist in reality?

Do Schwarzschild black holes exist in reality? I have searched answer for this question but am not fully satisfied. Everything in the universe, including planets, stars, and galaxies, is spinning. How can something nonrotating/non-spinning exist in the universe? From this link, it says that

A non-rotating black hole is extremely unlikely â€¦ even if one existed,
it would only take one photon to hit the event horizon off-centre to
give it angular momentum, ie start it rotating.

If they don't exist in reality then why do we study them?
