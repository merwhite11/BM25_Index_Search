What would happen if the Sun, Moon and Earth were isolated?

I am curious to know what would happen to Earth and life on Earth if all other heavenly bodies outside of our Sun, Moon and our planet Earth ceased to exist in some non-destructive way? (this includes other stars, other planets, asteroids, etc.)
I have tried looking for the answer, but keep getting stuck in different unrelated rabbit holes. I did find a video on the topic ( 

 ) but the video simply makes assertions (e.g. if Mercury and Venus were gone, Earth would drift closer to the Sun) and lists consequences, but makes zero mention of how Earth's orbit would change, making it really difficult to believe or understand.
So simple question; if the universe were as big as the Sun, Earth and Moon and nothing else changed, how would our lives be impacted?
As caveats; assume this means in the "relatively" short term (within 1 million yrs) and that the Earth, Moon and Sun came to be in their exact current state through some other means.
Thanks!
