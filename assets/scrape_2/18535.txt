Are sulfur and phosphorus also created in the nucleosynthesis of big stars?

There are as far as I know two  fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium: The CNO cycle (for carbon–nitrogen–oxygen) and the  proton–proton chain reaction. 
The elements created in the CNO cycle are C,N,O and Fluor. 
But in this video min:13:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxrPaNDvaQE the prof. talks about Phosphorus and sulfur. Is that true and are those element also created in the CNO cycle or is he talking about something else?
