Mauna Kea versus Mauna Loa: Astronomy ethical considerations

There have been controversies and conflicts related to telescopes/observatories developed on Mauna Kea, as described here. However, there does not seem to be controversies related to observatories on Mauna Loa, as seen here.
Has Mauna Loa also been a site of controversy, in terms of building astronomy observatories on its top? Or, is it not deemed as sacred by the indigenous populations?
Basically, I am curious about the difference between scientists using the top of Mauna Kea versus Mauna Loa. Thank you.
