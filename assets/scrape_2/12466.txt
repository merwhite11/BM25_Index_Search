Can we compress any object to create black Holes?

In general, when a star runs out of nuclear fuel, gravity gets the upper hand and the material in the core is compressed even further and creates black holes. I am clear till  here.
Now the question is: Does that depend on the mass of the star (or object)?
Naturally, the more massive the core of the star, the greater the force of gravity that compresses the material and easy to create Black Hole.
For smaller stars, when the nuclear fuel is exhausted and there are no more nuclear reactions to fight gravity, the repulsive forces among electrons within the star eventually create enough pressure to halt further gravitational collapse. The star then cools and dies peacefully.
In science videos and discussions is said that we can create black holes from any object. For example, if we are able to compress Earth to the size of the tennis ball, can we then create a black hole?
Isn't the nuclear fusion / reaction necessary to create a black hole? Of course, to fight against gravity we may require some kind of energy in this case, Nuclear reactions. But I am generally concerned like, does Nuclear Reaction is only to fight gravity, it does not play any other role in creating Black Hole.
