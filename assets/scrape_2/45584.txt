Why does metallicity increase the opacity inside stars?

A vague answer I've seen is that it has something do with a greater number of possible excited states, but I don't know what this means for a partially ionized plasma - much less a fully ionized plasma - nor how this would allow the plasma inside a star to absorb more radiation.
