In Jovian and Saturnian moons with subsurface oceans, why doesn't the surface sink?

The surface of some of the Jovian and Saturnian moons for which subsurface oceans have been proposed contains materials denser than water like rock. What keeps the surface from sinking under the subsurface ocean?
Also, what is the explanation for ruling out a process of differentiation during the moons' formation that placed material denser than water on top of subsurface oceans?
