What percentage of the time can we see the moon during the day?

From sun rise to sun set what percentage of the time is the moon visible?
I saw one thing at the top of google saying an average of 6 hours a day but that seems like a weird way to answer it. Would that be 25% of the itâ€™s visible
Any math or diagrams are much appreciated to better help me grasp it.
