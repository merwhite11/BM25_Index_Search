Does the Perseid peak cause enough light pollution to be a problem?

The annual Perseid peak occurs between August 9-14. During this time, about one meteor burns up in the atmosphere per minute.
When these meteorites burn up, they generate light. When you have one of these per minute, does it produce enough light pollution to be a problem for those making astronomical observations?
