Location of star HD 135591

The star is located at a distance of 163,000 light years in the constellation of Circinus.  As the Milky Way is 100,000 light years, this would then imply the star is outside the Milky Way?  Would it be a data anomoly if that is the case or is it in another galaxy like r136a?  Would it be on the far side of the galaxy, other side of the Galactic Centre?
