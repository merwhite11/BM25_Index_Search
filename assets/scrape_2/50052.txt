Is the Sun "chemically peculiar", and if not why is HD 222925?

In Wikipedia it defines "chemically peculiar stars (CP stars)" as,

In astrophysics, chemically peculiar stars (CP stars) are stars with distinctly unusual metal abundances, at least in their surface layers.

HD 222925 has been making a lot of news lately. In this video by Anton Petrov, "Groundbreaking Image of the Most Element Rich Star Found to Date
" he says,

[HD 222925] was always classified as "chemically peculiar" or basically unusual or somewhat strange and there is a really important reason for that. [...] With the exception of our own Sun this particular star seems to be extremely rich in various elements. A relatively recent study identified 65 various elements, chemical elements, including Gold with an overabundance of a lot of other metal that's never been seen before anywhere except in our own Sun.

It sounds like HD 222925 is "chemically peculiar" because of the composition of the star. If so, is our Sun also "chemically peculiar"? And if not, what is the definition of "chemically peculiar" such that our Sun is NOT and HD 222925 is?
