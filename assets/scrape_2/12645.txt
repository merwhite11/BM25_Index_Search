If there are neutron stars, would most stars be considered "proton stars"?

For example, the Sun is a giant sphere of positively charged plasma. About 72% of the elements in it are protium. This means that these protium atoms would have had to lose their electrons, right? If so, the majority of the Sun would be protons. So just as there are neutron stars, would stars like our Sun be considered "proton stars"?
This may be a stupid question, but what I'm really getting at is: are stars mostly protons? Is what I described how it all works?
