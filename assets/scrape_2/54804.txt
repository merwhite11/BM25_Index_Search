Is gravitational lensing, optical in nature or topological?

If a large mass can adjust space geometry
Like a blackhole or another star system
Then is this effect optical in nature or topological?
I know those sounds close, but a mirror reflects light.
A mirror does not act as a portal (if you know the game portals).
I came to wonder if, by some topological disorder of space itself.
The effects as seen in gravitational lensing might be a topological effect.
Though I don't know if we can already discriminate between optical vs. toplogical.
(Perhaps based on theory or perhaps because of the things astronomers can see in gravitational lenses or even if people have ever tried to look for such effects)
With an extra dimension, topological mirrors would be possible (and thus could be proof of such). If so, then this would affect essential all 3d space (leaving out time as a dimension as it's not a dimension)
