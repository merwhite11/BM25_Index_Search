Best response to shut down the fake Moon landing conspiracy

This Question was closed for various reasons. For people looking for the answer to similar question, please see this link. I believe this is a solid answer to my question.
As the designated Space Cadet of my friends, I often have people come to me with questions regarding Outer Space. The most recent call came from a friend who was being aggressively told that the Moon landing was fake. 
Now, we all know this is a conspiracy. In fact, conspiracy isn't actually the correct word per the definition. It's simply an incorrect claim. On top of this, we all have our return arguments to those who doubt the Moon landing. But I think anyone who has been in this argument has run into the typical conspiracy theorist issue:
As soon as you prove one claim to be false, they hit you with another that you need to fight against.
So, here is the question I ask all of us to think about:
What is a single fact/argument that completely debunks the claim that the Moon landing was faked?
(Emphasis on single fact/argument)

Disclaimer: I know that technically it isn't up to me to prove that the landing wasn't fake, but rather up to them to prove to me that it was fake. However, I still want to help people learn and be educated, so I would love some thoughtful answers to this question. Plus... I love a good argument (and I definitely love winning a good one too).
