Where/how are metals distributed in our universe?

For one particular kind of element, what is the distribution in the whole universe?
Are most of the metals located in ISM, IGM, or stars? Maybe different metals have different distributions?
For example, could most of the Mg be found in white dwarfs?
Have all the natural elements have been found in stars?
