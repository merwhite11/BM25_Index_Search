Is broadcasting the location of Earth to potential extraterrestial civilization regulated?

How many times have we broadcast the location of Earth to the outer space? Are there any regulation in doing so?
I know so far we have send the Arecibo Message, and any receiver can trace the message sender's direction by the direction with which the message is received. But have we ever pin point our exact location of the galaxy and send it as a message?
