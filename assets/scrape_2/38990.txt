Is there a website out there where I can find/compare data on stellar parameters for the brightest stars?

I'm looking for some kind of catalog/repository which lists stellar parameters (e.g. mass, radius, temperature) in a similar vein to NASA's Exoplanet Catalog (but except for stars), for the brightest stars in the sky, with $m_v<4$. I'd rather not have to refer to Wikipedia as they only list data from one source (or an average of several uncited sources).
I'm aware of SIMBAD, but that site doesn't have a very intuitive UI and doesn't list mass measurements. I've also tried CDS (http://cdsportal.u-strasbg.fr/), but I can't find distance measurements from Gaia (although apparently Gaia doesn't measure distance and I need to put some kind of external study into a Gaia search query which I haven't got a clue how to use).
