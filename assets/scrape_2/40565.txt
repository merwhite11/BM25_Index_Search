How is it that Jupiter and Saturn appear the same size in the sky?

Saturn is twice as far as Jupiter is from Earth according to a quick Google search. But I needed to understand why do they appear as if they are the same size. I mean as if they are not far apart. For a common man's understanding things that are far should appear smaller than they are, right? What is the reason behind it?
