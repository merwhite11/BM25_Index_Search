Slow moving star like objects in the night sky

So yesterday at about 2am I was watching the sky when I saw a small star like object moving very slowly across the sky. My initial thought was that it was a satellite due to the fact it was moving so slowly and wasn’t flashing. However  then I saw another one moving in the same direction about 10 minutes later. I had to keep letting my eyes adjust to the darkness to see it as it was so small but in total, I saw 4 of them moving in very similar directions, almost like they were following a path. There was about a 5-10min gap between each one and I could see it the entire time until it dipped over the tree line. I live in a very rural area so there was no light pollution or anything to interfere with the view. Now I know that around about now we are able to observe the Perseid meteor shower from the comet Swift-Tuttle but these object were very slow moving and I don’t really know how slow a meteor can move, but isn’t it strange that all of them were moving in the same direction? I also did see some normal meteors but as you’d expect, they only lasted for a second or under. Anyone have a clue what’s going on? Thanks.
