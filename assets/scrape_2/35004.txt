What could I resolve with my Telescope

I recently won a Common 50mm refracting telescope with Solar Filter too.. I'm trying to Understand things I can skygaze with it. It's pretty basic and I should have known. Unfortunately, I don't possess this knowledge now. I had searched on various good websites which detailed and other requisite! Given, I stay in Navi-Mumbai, India, and less cloudy and less dusty area, what would my telescope's eye see? 
And how to maintain and keep the Telescope in a good state.
What things would make me a better amateur-observational-astronomer?
