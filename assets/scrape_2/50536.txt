How do we know universe is expanding and not light slowing down?

We tend to take some things for granted, for example the light of speed is constant, but what if it isn't? How can we know that light is not slowing down at great distances for example, or that light speed is constant during time and not oscillating in time?
We see redshift observations on galaxies at the edge of the universe and our explanation is that the galaxies are moving away from us and accelerating, thus the universe must be expanding. How do we know that the light doesn't lose velocity at those distances and that's what creates the redshift-ness.
As light slows down, it takes more time to come to us, which appears as being further away. If light stops completely because it loses all momentum that's the observable universe horizon, instead of space expanding faster than light.
It's actually the same thing, but reading it differently, keeping constant the space and making variable the light speed, instead of the other way.
Can you convince me somehow that's not the case in layman's terms?
I'm noob so please be gentle.
