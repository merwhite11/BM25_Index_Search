Sun's spectrum red shift

Does Sun's spectrum expose any red shift at all? Namely, the center of it's visible area (not due to limb effect). If it does, how much is it and does it comply with relativity theory or is it higher/lower than theoretically predicted? 
I red about it an article dated 1960 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1960MNRAS.121..421H) and not sure if new studies show different results. Thanks.
