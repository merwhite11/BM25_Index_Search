Which telescope(s) did Charles Messier use to catalog his 110 objects?

Charles Messier is known for (among other things) a catalog of "Messier objects".
Neither article shows an image of "Messier's telescope", though the latter includes:

Since these objects could be observed visually with the relatively small-aperture refracting telescope (approximately 100 mm â‰ˆ 4 inches) used by Messier to study the sky, they are among the brightest and thus most attractive astronomical objects...

Question: Which telescope(s) did Charles Messier use to catalog his 110 objects? Is the telescope (or telescopes) still around?
Note that after describing the advent (and invention) of the achromatic lens, Neil English in Figure 6.5 on page 92 in the chapter Charles Messier, the Ferret of Comets in Chronicling the Golden Age of Astronomy; A History of Visual Observing from Harriot to Moore shows the following telescope with the caption:

but this is meant as an illustrative example only.
