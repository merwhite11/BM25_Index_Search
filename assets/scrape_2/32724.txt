Would radio telescope located anywhere within a 100 light year radius detect our radio emissions?

If there was a radio telescope, as sophisticated as our best radio telescopes within a 100 light year radius from earth.
AND if its sole purpose was search for signs of artificial/intelligent radio transmissions like our SETI program. 
What chance would such radio telescope have of detecting our radio emissions regardless of its three dimensional location relative to earth and how would that chance change the further it is from us?
