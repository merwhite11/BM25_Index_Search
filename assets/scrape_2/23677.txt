Extragalactic Magnetic Fields - General Information That I'm Missing

I have started studying Extragalactic Magnetic Fields, and mainly focusing on Biermann Battery Theory. I have gathered much information on other Dynamo Theories, as well as about our current Observational and Theoretical status on Magnetic Field Genesis.
What I'm looking for though, is a general "picture" on Extragalactic Magnetic Fields, as a whole. Faraday Rotation, AGN Jets, are basically the topics I have tracked, but I'm pretty sure there are a lot of others.
So I'm asking, if someone has studied in-depth extragalactic structures and magnetic field, possibly could guide me on some of the main and hot topics around them. This way I would have more knowledge on the topic which would be great for me!
I mean just Topic-Titles, would be great!
