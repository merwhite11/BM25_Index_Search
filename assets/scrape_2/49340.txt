What object(s) are furthest above/below the galactic plane?

This is kind of a spin-off of a question I did about a space telescope surveying the galaxy from above the galactic plane. So, it made me wonder, which object in the Milky Way has been spotted orbiting furthest above or below the galactic plane? I can't seem to find anything mentioning this. However, I have come across galactic/interstellar extinction, so I believe it's possible this question is just not knowable from our current location. On the other question, there is a link to a page that says our solar system is about 100 light years above/below the galactic plane. So, how far is the furthest object from the galactic plane spotted, to date?
