Can I use ENVI Classic to process JWST tiff image?

I am interested to process JWST or any other astronomical images. Can I use ENVI Classic to process it? I have some JWST tiff images and I would like to know about the gasses, compounds, the brightness of stars, or anything. I am not sure about which tools I have to use.
