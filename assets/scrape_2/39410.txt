Do brown dwarfs have stripes?

Brown dwarfs (BD) are often depicted with stripes.

Pictures of BD resemble Jupiter but brown dwarfs have even more stripes.
Question:
How do we know brown dwarfs have so many stripes?
I suppose it can differ depending on BD's temperature and mass. Probably only cold BD can have stripes.
Were the stripes observed? (by photometry, by transit or occultation, etc)
Or are the stripes result of theoretical modeling? Or just "artist impression" because of lack of information?
If result of modeling - do the stripes represent analogs of Hadley cell athmospheric circulation? Are they high and low pressure bands?

Do brown dwarfs have so many bands because of higher gravity?
