In shear component $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ of weak lensing, Why does the defining with $2\phi$ reflect "real angle"?

From the review paper Bartelmann and schneider, 1999) [Weak Gravitational Lensing], page 48.
Like above, $\gamma_1 \equiv \left| \gamma \right| \cos(2\phi), \gamma_2 \equiv \left| \gamma \right|\sin(2\phi)$.
we have to definite like this to match the definition of $\gamma_1 \text{ and } \gamma_2$ with real angle, $\phi$.
This point is right what I want to know.
