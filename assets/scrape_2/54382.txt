If E.T. alien civilizations exist, won't those exoplanets be almost the age and rate of progress as ours?

This question is posed also as a mini theory, although I am really asking if someone knows how some parts of our universe would be far-more advanced if "everything" started at the same time (i.e. The Big Bang (BB)).
Could the advancement of some parts of the universe, be much greater if everything originated from the same point, like the Big Bang theory suggests? I pondered this when I learned about Proxima Centauri B, a habitable exoplanet discovered in 2016, and wondered why its potential civilization (or any from other exoplanets), could be vastly more advanced than ours.
Considering the Big Bang theory's stages of cosmic origin, where everything started from a single point and expanded like ripples (metaphorically speaking,) it's conceivable that the elements of the creation, such as particles, matter, energy, and gases, came into existence around a similar time frame. This makes me question whether we might be overestimating the technological progress of potential alien civilizations. Perhaps, they haven't advanced remarkably faster than us, and that's why we haven't received any tangible evidence of their existence.
In a way, this alternative perspective challenges the notion of a Type 2 or 3 civilization, already thriving out there. It raises intriguing possibilities about the shared origins of the cosmos and how it may influence the development of life and technology on habitable planets.
So, could we just be waiting for signals from other extraterrestrial civilizations in vain?
