How much is the zoom of Sun-Pluto eclipse image

The Sun-Pluto eclipse picture was taken from 2 million km from Pluto. At that distance, Pluto will have angular size of just 4'5". Hence this picture must be a zoomed up image. Approximately how much will be the zoom of this image? Also, is it possible to give the power of its camera in megapixel terms? Thanks for your responses.
