Which Venus scientists discovered the hole in the ozone layer?

After 21:00 in Venus: Earthâ€™s Evil Twin or Just Misunderstood? (live public talk) from the JPL YouTube channel the person being interviewed "Sue Smrekar, Rocky Planet Geoscientist" (and Deputy Principal Investigator, Mars InSight lander) says that there is a link between the observation of Venus and the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer. Is there more information on this link? Which Venus researchers noticed the hole in the ozone layer? What comparisons were they trying to make when they noticed this?
I wasn't sure if I should post this question here because of the observation of Venus or if I should post it in Earth Science SE.

Key sentences starting at around 21:10:

We have learned a lot of different things about volcanic processes. For example, you want to know what's coming out in those volcanic gasses. People who were studying the atmosphere of Venus were actually the ones that discovered the ozone hole on the Earth, because they were looking for similar kinds of chemical processes in the Earth.
