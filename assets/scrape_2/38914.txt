Phosphine on Venus?

For the purposes of this question, let's assume that the team really have detected phosphine.
My question is how do we know that phosphine is on Venus, and not closer to home?
I've just found out a bit more about this detection. It was detected on 2 separate ground-based telescopes at different times, and was detected via the absorption spectra.
There is a lot of atmosphere between those telescopes and the initial light source, both on Venus and here on Earth.
So how do we know that the absorption took place in Venus' atmosphere and not our own (or perhaps even somewhere in between, although this seems less likely)?
