Solar flare generate energetic protons. Where do the electrons go?

A solar flare sends many atoms in space (mainly He and H), many of which, when they reach Earth, are ions (He++ and H+).
What I recall from my school days, is that an electron goes from one atom to another, one example of such transfers being electricity.
What I'm wondering is: where do the Helium and Hydrogen electrons go to in an event such as a solar flare?
