What stabilizes rings or accretion disks?

We think, more or less, that our Moon was formed from an accretion disk caused by a Mars-sized impactor. Cool. 
Tidal forces can break apart a moon, causing rings. 
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust: the moon came from an orbiting debris disk and may return to an orbiting debris disk someday.
What determines whether an accretion disk or ring system will form moons vs. remain as stable rings?
