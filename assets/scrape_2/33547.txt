What might some examples be of radio telescope interferometric arrays made from "cheap components relying on massive computing power"?

This answer mentions that there are some interferometric radio telescope arrays

...consisting of very cheap components relying on massive computing power to retrieve the signals from noise...

The radio interferometers that normally come to mind for me are the VLA and especially ALMA type, where there are only dozens of dishes, each one extremely high-tech and chock full of analog and digital electronics, often linked by high speed fiber optic cables.
