Why is TiO special?

Red spectra of M stars are dominated by TiO(Titanium oxide) bands, which have become the primary means of establishing spectral types.see ApJ
Why is TiO special? 
There should be much more Silicon elements than Titanium if we suppose the element abundance of M stars are similar to our sun.(Solar abundance is here). If similarï¼Œthere should be much more SiO2 than TiO?
