Exploiting symmetry in the axisymmetric Jeans equations

I'm solving the axisymmetric Jeans equations to determine the initial conditions for an exponential disk inside an NFW halo. The density profiles of the two components are 
\begin{equation}
\rho_d(R,z)=\rho_{0,d}\exp\left(-\frac{R}{R_0}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{|z|}{z_0}\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\rho_h(r)=\frac{\rho_{0,h}}{r/r_s(1+r/r_s)^2}
\end{equation}
Due to the axial symmetry, for the meridional velocity dispersion we have
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2(R,z)=\frac{1}{\rho}\int_z^\infty \rho \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z'}dz'
\end{equation}
As the galaxy is symmetric about the disk plane ($z=0$), we would expect the distribution function at a distance $h$ above the disk plane to be identical to that at $z=-h$; in other words, if we flip the galaxy, the only difference will be a change in direction of particle motion, but not speed or dispersion.
Therefore, can't we replace the $z$ in the limit with $|z|$?
