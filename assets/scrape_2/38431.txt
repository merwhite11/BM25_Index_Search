What name was voted for Tau Boötis b by the Name Exoworlds Project?

In 2015, the exoplanet Tau Boötis b was included in the  Name Exoworlds Project, a project where various international astronomy organizations would propose names for a selection of known exoplanets that complied with a set of guidelines presented by the International Astronomical Union. Upon completion of submissions, voting was opened to the public, with the selected and approved names being published.
The IAU decided that the name voted for Tau Boötis b did not not meet the naming guidelines, and annulled the result of the vote.
I have no objection to them deciding to not use the name, and  I don't want this to be come an argument as to whether they should have annulled it. I just want to know: has it ever been revealed what the public-voted name was, and if non-obvious, the reason it was annulled?
