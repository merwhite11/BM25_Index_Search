Is Titan Better or Mars?

Isn't Titan better to colonize than Mars? It has a thick atmosphere which is made up of nitrogen like our planet's. It doesn't have a magnetic field, but it does get a type of protection from Saturn. Maybe the only downside I see is that it is too far away. While Mars has neither a thick atmosphere nor a magnetic field, it is bombarded with solar radiation every day.
