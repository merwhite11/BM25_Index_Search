What are the procedures and protocols to use with Gauss'method and personal observations?

I would like to use the Gauss' method to determine the orbit of planets of solar system.
I would like to calculate their orbits with personal observations.
What is the methodology/procedure/protocol to follow?
What data do I need to measure during my observations?
