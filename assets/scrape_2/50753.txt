How could Mars' atmosphere be shed by solar winds, when Venus has a thick atmosphere despite no magnetic field?

Our current understanding of how Mars lost its atmosphere is because it lost it magnetic field, due to a barrage of reasons, such as core cooling due to low volume and cooling off quickly. This resulted in solar winds stripping away its atmosphere, turning it into a near-vacuum.
However, Venus is nearly 2x closer to the Sun, than Mars, and thus should have shed out its atmosphere really quickly, as it too has no magnetosphere. Yet Venus is the exact opposite of Mars. It is extremely hot, and its atmosphere is so dense that it can crush humans like a paper-cup.
