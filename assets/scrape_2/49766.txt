Why does sun rise further north of where it does any other time of year? I know rises differently depending on the season but this is like never seen

I’ve lived in the outskirts of the city (San Diego). The sun obviously rises in the same place every morning and changes a little as the year progresses. Now it is so far to the left of my normal view in any given time of the year. I know it sounds crazy but where it is rising is nowhere close to any other time in the may years I’ve lived here.
