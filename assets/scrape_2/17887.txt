How to calculate a Galactocentric distance of another galaxy

So I have two parameters, I have the distance to a galaxy of 879 kpc and the sky distance in degrees (0.131501). How would I then use these two bits of information to calculate the Galactocentric distance in kpc? 
N.B. for the two objects within M33, i.e., the centre of M33 and an undefined region of M33 are separated by 0.131501 degrees. Both objects can assume to have a distance from us of ~879 kpc.
So I want to convert the value for the distance between the two objects within M33 (0.131501 degrees) to kpc...
