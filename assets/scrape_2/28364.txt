Why has the orbit of Venus such a low eccentricity?

The eccentricity of Venus is almost 14 times smaller than that of Mars, and 2.5 times smaller than that of Earth, and 30 times smaller than that of Mercury. Is it just a pure fluke? Or is there some “physical reasons”? I realize those are the ratios as of now, and that they change over time: will the evolution of those eccentricities dramatically change those ratios? If not, then the question of a “physical reason” emerges again.
