A friend of mine wants to buy a telescope and begins observing in person. The area won't be among the most polluted in Italy, say the Milky Way is often visible by eyes and she already gets some traces of it while playing with modern smartphone and the apps they are equipped with. 
She has spotted the above telescope. 
Now, both me and my friend like amateur astronomy but we totally lack of knowledge on observational backyard astronomy and the related optics. 
Would the linked telescope be a good starting point for a total beginner? Does it allow for the observation of nebulae and Andromeda while being OK for planetary seeing as well?
Alternatively feel free to signal if this can be a sort of overshooting. Though the budget is not an issue, considering that it just to begin is somehow mandatory.
What I began to consider is avoiding to invest some money in something that requires a very very dark environment in order to be used to see diffused objects. The telescope will stay, at least most of the times, in a dark extraurban area nevertheless close to several towns. 
Would you suggest this scope or is there something making it not a good or reasonable choice for beginners?

PS beginning astrophotography is also considered, it can be as simple as having a smartphone mount. But playing with smartphones is how we became enthusiastic about astronomy and photography.
