Michigan's Pole Star

Unfortunately, I'm not any good at figuring these things out myself so hope for help here. If the (true) north pole were over the Keweenaw Peninsula of Northern Michigan, what would the North Star be; a star, similar to Polaris that never sets? Or, what star would be directly overhead? I couldn't even pick out Venus or Mars in the night sky when I was younger and now, for personal reasons, I'm unable to go out and look. Any help would be incredibly appreciated. Thank you
