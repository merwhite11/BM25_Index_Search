What effect does stellar granulation to have on a chemical analysis of a star's spectrum?

The spectrum from stellar granules will obviously be for hotter gas, while the spectrum from the lanes between them will be for cooler gas.

Does this "average out" so that an average temperature distribution can be used for a metallicity analysis?
Will the spectroscopic effects be the same for all lines?
