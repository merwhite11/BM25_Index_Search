Focusing with Meade Audiostar

I recently upgraded from a Meade ETX-RA to and ETX-EC and bought a used Audiostar controller. My EC came with a Meade autofocuser and one of the old (I think itâ€™s 494) controllers that has the focus controls and the four lights on it. Is it possible to just plug the autofocuser AUX cord into the Audiostar and focus from that? I read the manual for the autofocuser and it seems like I should be able to. Just not sure which controls I am supposed to use.
