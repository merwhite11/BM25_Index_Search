English Meaning for Abreviations (Easy Question)

I see a lot of publications where they use "code"/abbreviations but don't give the Laymans equivalents.  Take https://academic.oup.com/view-large/127773013 from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/483/2/2300/5184501?login=false
The columns are :-
HD 
Effective Temperature (Kelvin)
Radius (Solar Radius)
Solar Luminosity(?)
Mass (Solar Mass)
Unknown
Unknown
Age(?)

What are the unknown columns, am not clued up enough to copy the notation?
I have found https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_astronomy_symbols but those above I can't find
If anyone knows of anywhere which explains these codes, that'll be awesome.
