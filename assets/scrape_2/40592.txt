Observed meteors on Venus?

In an article on Venus by JPL from 1996 I read

Due to the dense Venusian atmosphere, primary impact craters of less than a 3 kilometer (2 mile) diameter are nonexistent.

I am now wondering whether there is somewhere a comprehensive list of (other) directly observed strikes of incoming rocks  on Venus e.g. by atmospheric anomalities?
Side-question: What minimal size must an object entering Venus' have in order to reach the ground and/or leave an obserable trace on the surface?

Wikipedia List of craters on Venus would allow to compile a size distribution of all incoming objects larger than a certain size.
