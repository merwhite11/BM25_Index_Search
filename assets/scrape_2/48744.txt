Why is there no black hole-like activities inside a massive star?

Black holes are very dense objects in our universe, where a star that is several times more massive than our sun is compressed within a few kilometers. And here, the intense gravity of the black hole is not getting "added" after a star's collapse. Instead it is created by the same remnant of the star that exploded.
In simple terms, Newton's law of gravitation is enough to explain it. Just like the surface gravity of Betelgeuse is less compared to our sun's (if I am right), the gravity deep inside the star, let's say a few hundred kilometers from its center will be so intense, by Newton's law, we can say that the distance is so small. Then why is there no black hole-like activities there?
