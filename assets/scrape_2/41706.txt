Synodic Day and Sidereal Day

If given the sidereal day, is it possible to derive the synodic day of Earth? If a derivation is possible, could anyone illustrate it or point me in the right direction?
Wikipedia's Synodic day begins:

A synodic day is the period it takes for a planet to rotate once in relation to the star it is orbiting (its primary body).

Question: How can one calculate that?
