Recommendation for introductory cosmology text

I am looking for recommendations for an introductory text (or texts) on cosmology on the advanced undergrad or beginning grad level. I am coming from primarily a physics undergrad background (doing some undergrad research on galaxy Lyman-alpha emission and attending some of my institution's astrophysics journal club meetings) and will beginning a graduate astrophysics program in the fall. I am looking especially for texts that also provide a good introduction into GR since I have never had a chance to learn GR formally.  I have had a lot of experience with Lyman-alpha radiative transfer and some experience with large-scale structure and baryon oscillation, if there are any books that can play off those strengths.
