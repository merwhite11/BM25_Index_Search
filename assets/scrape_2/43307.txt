Why isn't most hydrogen in the universe molecular (diatomic), instead of atomic (monoatomic)?

Similar questions have been asked before; but, why?
Is the monoatomic hydrogen left over from the Big Bang?  And hasn't had the opportunity to collide with other hydrogen atoms yet?
Or are hydrogen molecules that do form split up after absorbing ultraviolet radiation or X-rays?  Which occurs more frequently than molecule-forming random collisions?
What is the 'activation energy' needed to form diatomic hydrogen from atomic?  Is it too much for the randomly-colliding hydrogen atoms to form molecules in the depths of space?
I mean, if the loose protons and electrons shot out by stars can (usually) find each other to form atoms, which is why neutral atomic hydrogen is more common between the stars and planets than ionized hydrogen, why can't the lonely atoms find each other to form ${\rm H_2}$?
