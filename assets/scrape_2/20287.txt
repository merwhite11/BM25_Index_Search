How can artificial gravity hold the water in swimming pool?

I was watching Passengers (2016). In this movie, a swimming pool exists in the space station. In middle of the movie, Artificial Gravity is turned off and the water rises, with the swimmer suffocating as they try to get out of the water.
Suddenly Artificial Gravity turned itself on again and the swimmer survives.
A clip of this scene is found on YouTube.
However, water is an anti-ferromagnetic material - it can't attract to magnetic bodies.
How then, can artificial gravity hold the water in swimming pool?
My question is totally different from this question.
