Location on (or in) the celestial sphere

First off, I apologize if I am breaking any site-etiquitte. Secondly, this is probably extremely elementary. 
For a lab, I was given the question:

When we are sitting in a planetarium, where are we located on(or in)
  the "celestial sphere"?

To me, this seems like a silly question - because the answer is really dependent on where the operator places you. Is this assumption wrong? Is there a particular place in the celestial sphere that you would be?
I also thought that it might just be the very center of the celestial sphere.
