Physical measurements and celerity of black hole mergers?

LIGO detected a black hole merger for bh's of about 30 solar masses, with a schwartzchild radii of about 20km. 
Were the gravity waves generated by masses distanced by a few microns or a few kilometers? 
A LIGO article states: 
The Keplerian effective black hole separation in units of Schwarzschild radii
(RS ¼ 2GM=c2) and the effective relative velocity given by the
post-Newtonian parameter v=c ¼ ðGMπf=c3Þ1=3, where f is the
gravitational-wave frequency calculated with numerical relativity
and M is the total mass (FIG. 2.).
They state a relative velocity of 0.4 c for 100ms, can't we compare that to electron orbits or something practical? Electrons travel at 0.01 c. Can we say that the merging masses are 40 times smaller than an H atom?
Can we state that the signal does not continue for an entire minute up to 90Khz, perhaps forever, except that the rest is too faint to detect on LIGO For some reason?
