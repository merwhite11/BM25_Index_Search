Earth-Mars-Moon or No Moon Barycenter Orbit Possible?

Could an object of sufficient mass deflect Mars so that it ends up stably orbiting an Earth-Mars-Moon barycenter? What would the distances eventually become between each orbiting body?
What if the Moon got kicked out in such a scenario? Could an Earth-Mars barycenter exist stably and what distance would they orbit each other if so?
How stable would the crusts of all three bodies be from the changes assuming it occurred over a period of 100 years?
