very bright object (visible even after sun risen)

Brevard Co. FL. At first I thought it was a comet it appeared to have a tail. Starts out low in the east and gains elevation as the sun rises. As the sun is just above the horizon it is still visible at about an 80 degree elevation. What am I seeing?
