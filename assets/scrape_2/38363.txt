Why can't we see Saturn's phases from earth?

In the Astronomy Picture of the Day from August 8, 2020 ("Crescent Saturn"), the caption states

From Earth, Saturn never shows a crescent phase

Why is this? We can observe phases on planets such as Venus which have an apparent size a lot smaller than Saturn. Saturn is not tidally locked to the sun (only Mercury is).
So why does the sunlit face of Saturn always face Earth?
