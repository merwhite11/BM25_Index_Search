Why moon sighted only in Kerala but not in rest of India?

I know for most of you the question may look silly, but Kerala is a state in India where the moon (Ramadan moon) will be sighted but not in rest of India.
I was reading the news article where I got a little hint but was not clear for me since I am newbie, tried to google but couldn't find much info :) can someone explain me.

Eid is likely to be celebrated in Kerala tomorrow. Due to the
  geographical location of the coastal state, the lunar moon is sighted
  in the state a day before the rest of India.
