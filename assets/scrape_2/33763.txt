Can a change in the density of interstellar and intergalactic quantum fields affect the Redshift of photons?

Using our solar system's heliosphere as an analagy to what is happening in our galaxy and even the universe as a whole, can light redshift with changes in quantum fields? 
The universe is constantly being bombarded by particles from stars, pulsars, quasars, black holes, etc..    Is it possible for these particles to interact with photons in a way that will cause light to redshift?
