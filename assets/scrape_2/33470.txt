How much infrared radiation is emitted by a bow shock?

Has the amount of energy being emitted from R Hydrae's bow shock been studied?

If so, is there any information how much infrared radiation is emitted in any means of measurement? 
If the infrared energy from the Sun, measured 1 AU from the Sun being approximately 680 watts per meter square, how would the infrared energy of the bow shock compare at the same distance measured in the same units?
Thanks to AtmosphericPrisonEscape for pointing me in the right direction.  I found this table from the DETECTION OF A FAR-INFRARED BOW SHOCK NEBULA AROUND R HYA: THE FIRST MIRIAD RESULTS.

with the CSEs being the circumstellar envelopes.  Does this mean the CSE (bow shock?) is about 57% (19.7 compared to 33.9) the flux of the star at the 70 microns (mosaic) band?
