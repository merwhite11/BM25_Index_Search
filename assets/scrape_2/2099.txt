Layout of the universe

I've been working on a space game in my spare time, and lately I've been thinking on how to lay out the universe. Though I've searched around and found it hard to get a good view of what the universe looks like. I did find a lot of good sources, though I'm a very visual learner and found it hard to get a good picture of the universe with what I found. I also don't know what the good, reliable, accurate and up-to-date sources were.
So, are there any good visual sources to get a picture of the universe? Preferably a TV-series or a very well illustrated book, or perhaps even computer program.
Edit: I'm looking for a more general view of the universe. Like what do galaxies look like, and what is their scale. As I understand they contain a combination of planets, solar systems, star clusters, ... Though I couldn't get a good picture of how dense they are. Is there a lot of space (relatively) between these solar systems and star-clusters. I found that our solar system is about 4 light-hours big, though are the neighbouring ones average light years or thousands of light-years away? And in the space between them, is it mostly empty or is there space dust?
The same question for whatever our galaxy circles around (if it does) and what is between different galaxies. (And perhaps what else is there of galaxy-size out there?)
I got a vague view of all of this from reading texts, though I feel like I'm missing a whole lot.
Edit 2: I'm not looking for properties of different planets, that's on a too small scale. In the game I'm planning on making a fictional universe (perhaps randomly generated, though not yet decided), but I want the broad layout to be realistic.
Edit 3: I just found this: http://htwins.net/scale2/ This helped me A LOT in getting a sense of the relative size of things.
Thanks a lot!
