Did I see a meteorite in daylight? (4.30pm on 11/6/23

l saw a meteorite from my backyard at an elevation of about on 50ft on 11/6/23 at 4.30pm. It travelled from approx ENE to WSW in about 1-2 seconds. The object was traveling horizontally, not falling, for the period I saw it. It zipped by in a flash! It was mainly brown but looked blurry as though it was rotating at high speed, maybe due to its irregular shape(?). Just an assumption.
It also made a noise somewhat similar to a loud electric fan.
It travelled about 200yds (very approximately) and I calculated its speed between 200-400mph based on my 1-2 second observation.
I hope this links to my original report because my previous response somehow disappeared before I sent it.
Try to imagine an irregularly shaped brown rock rotating at high speed on its axis, traveling horizontally from my left to right, at my estimate of 200-400mph, at about 50ft above the ground (not sea level) over the 1-2 seconds that I was able to discern it. My field of view of the object was an estimated 200 yards (ie the visible distance it traveled before disappearing off to my right)
That’s what it looked like to me. I came to that conclusion based on the fact that the perimeter of the object seemed very blurred. I could not tell if it was descending in the short time I was able to process it.
The sound was loud, like a large fan to me, as you might imagine that a rotating irregularly shaped rock might make as it zipped through the air. Note that I have several hummingbirds in my back yard and I know what they sound like. Multiply their speed, sound and size by about 10 and  that might sound similar to the object.
At first I thought in terms of it being a UAP as I reported on Reddit, but after researching on line I thought it might be a meteorite, but after reading learned comments on Astronomy Stack Exchange i realized that was an probably incorrect assumption.
I’ve never taken drugs and am not given to flights of fancy, and would not waste my time or yours making things up.
In closing, I was totally focused on the object in that 1-2 seconds and when I look back now all I can visualize is its presence to the exclusion of its surroundings. So it’s a UAP again until I hear differently.
Do you think it was a meteorite based on my report?
Any estimates on how far away it would have impacted?
I live in zip code CA 93065.
What are the chances of this?
