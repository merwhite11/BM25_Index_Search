Almost unseeable light moving over nightsky. What is it?

Sometimes when I look up at the sky at night, I can see something moving. It’s so small that I barely can see it, but I can’t see it when I look directly at it. I need to look beside it to see it. It slowly moves across the sky, but it switches sometimes directions. It sometimes disappears and after a while, it’s back. It’s not a strong light at all so it’s easy to miss.
