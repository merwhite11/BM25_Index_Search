What planets and moons have we seeded with life (if any)?

Which planets and moons have we accidentally (or purposely) seeded with life?  I would expect this to be any planet or moon we have sent an unsterilized (or not fully sterilized) lander to, or crashed anything into.  
I am speaking largely of bacteria and other microorganisms that might have hitched a ride on our spacecraft, or any life that was deliberately taken to and left on another world (which I am not aware).  I know we went to the moon, we at the very least "seeded the moon" temporarily with life (humans) and probably bacteria on the space suits / lander / equipment we sent.
I wondering where we have "seeded" / brought life (even if it doesn't / didn't survive there).
