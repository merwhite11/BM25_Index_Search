Can distribution of stars / planets formation be a long-tailed one?

We know that peak of star formation already passed
10.1146/annurev-astro-032620-021910

and it looks like peak of planet formation occurred slightly after formation of Earth
10.1017/S1473550415000208

Even if we ignore possibility of life around red dwarfs that may live for trillions of years (as there a numerous problems with this - for example core of the planet cools much quicker), there is still possibility that planet formation will go for tens and hundreds of billions of years at reasonable rates (long-tail of the distribution) and that most planets will be formed in the future.
Can we exclude/prove this long-tailed possibility?
