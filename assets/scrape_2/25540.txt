How Does IceCube Trace a Neutrino to its Source?

I read the following claim in an article (Lisa Grossman, "Origin of Cosmic Oddities Proposed," Science News, February 17, 2018, 8).

... IceCube has already traced an especially high-energy neutrino to a single active black hole ... IceCube [Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica] could eventually trace neutrinos back to [active black holes in] galaxy clusters.

Aren't galaxy clusters at least millions of light-years from Earth?

Such neutrinos took millions of years to get to Earth.
Other sources could have been in the path of the neutrinos in such a distant past.
Are neutrinos affected by gravitational lenses as light can be?
Is such tracing possible because neutrinos react so weakly with matter?
