Black Holes: More Than One Entry Point?

Most animations and drawings of Black Holes that I've seen usually depict some kind of funnel which is the "entrance" to the black hole; let's call this the front.
Are there more than one way to enter the Black Hole, such as the back side (180 degrees from the "front" side)?
Can a Black Hole have more than one entry point?
(It's kind of difficult viewing a ball {the Black Hole} with multiple entry points around the surface, sucking in matter and light).
