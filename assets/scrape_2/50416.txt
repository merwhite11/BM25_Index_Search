What parameters of the Big Bang model will have to be adjusted to account for JWST's observations of highly redshifted galaxies?

There are a lot of claims, on YouTube at least, that the James Webb space telescope have found too many to old/highly redshifted normal looking galaxies to fit easily into the Big Bang model.
One such claim from a physicist by the name Eric Lerner can be found here. He claims that according to this article, that is supposedly soon to be published in Nature, they have found 100 000 more galaxies than expected at a redshift of z>10. I could not locate that particular number in the article
I wonder what part, if any, have to be adjusted in the current / "pre-James Webb" Big Bang model of the development of the universe due to the findings of James Webb. Claims are both that there are "too many" highly redshifted galaxies and that the "morphology distribution" of the highly redshifted galaxies are not as expected but that question is perhaps more suited for another question.
Question: What parameters, if any, of the standard Big Bang model will have to be adjusted in order to explain that the James Webb telescope (supposedly) has found that there are more highly redshifted galaxies than "pre-James Webb" cosmology had projected?
