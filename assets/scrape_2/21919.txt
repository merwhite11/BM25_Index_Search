Is there any legitimacy to this report of planet nine being discovered by an amateur?

Saw this article on someone from Hampshire UK reporting a possible discovery of Planet Nine. I thought that it would be too dim for anything but the most powerful telescopes to see. Is there any legitimacy to this article?
