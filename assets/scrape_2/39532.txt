The contribution of components like dark matter, stars and gas to the mass of a galaxy

I am doing an introductory course in astrophysics and astronomy undergrad level.
In it we were taught that the main components of matter in a galaxy are dark matter halo ($M_h$), gas ($M_{gas}$) and stars ($M_*$). Thus the mass of the galaxy can be given as the sum of these three components. I want to read more about this but when I search this on net I don't get any appropriate results or they are very advanced. I guess this is because the actual terminology and nomenclature of these masses is different.
Thus if anyone can give me accurate terminology of these masses it would be helpful.
Additionally we were told that given the mass of dark matter halo the other two masses can have only a certain range of values. I want to know how we can determine these range of values possible for a galaxy.
Also how do these values change as the galaxy ages?
Any links to resources regarding the above topics are also welcome.
Edit 1: Regarding my question above about the change in mass of galaxies over time I am giving my thinking. Please correct me if I am wrong somewhere.
Initially galaxy consists of only dark matter and gas. This initially contracts but later undergoes segmentation to form stars. Thus initially there should be decrease in $M_{gas}$. But slowly some gas is returned as stars die and also gathered from surroundings, hence the gas mass should remain constant or decrease at a very slow rate. Now for the stars initially $M_*$ should increase due to creation of new stars. But after some time as some of the early stars start dying out there will be simultaneous birth and death of stars, hence the $M_*$ should fairly remain constant during this period. Finally as the star formation rate decreases due to depletion of $M_{gas}$ the birth of new stars will be reduced. Slowly more and more stars will start dying and $M_*$ will be depleted leaving behind only heavier elements. Hence $M_*$ should decrease during this period. Finally coming to halo mass, I am still not sure about it. I think it should not change much over the lifetime of the galaxy because dark matter does not seem to interact with the baryonic mass. I know that these changes will be slow but can anyone give me a rough number on the slowness of these changes?
