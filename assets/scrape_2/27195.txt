Why Tidal Tails in Disk Galaxies, but not in Ellipticals?

Why do tidal tails result from only disk galaxies but not ellipticals. 
I understand that tidal tails are results of gravitational interactions not strong enough to completely plunge out the material violently. How is that they form only in organized motions (disk) rather than random motion (ellipticals). 
Any references to a detailed explanation is highly appreciated.
