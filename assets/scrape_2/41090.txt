Calculating the Angular Momentum of a planet

I want to calculate the Angular Momentum of any planet at any point on the orbit around the Sun.
Example: I want to calculate the Angular Momentum of Pluto today, on Jan 27, 2021 00:00:00 Hrs
Where can I get the actual data to calculate this?
I will need Mass, Velocity and Radius to calculate. Do I need the Î¸ too?
Is it readily calculated by NASA?
