How does NASA figure out orbital period and mass data for planets and other celestial bodies?

Does NASA calculate orbital periods using Kepler's Laws, or do they measure and observe it in some way? If the latter, how do they do so?
Similarly, does NASA calculate the mass of bodies using Kepler's 3rd Law, or do they measure it some other way?
