Which unit is most suitable in comparing needed light intensity for night reading on the Moon, vs on Earth?

Which unit is best to use, and why, when determining how many times easier it is to read a newspaper (or any other printed text) on the moons surface at night under a full earth, compared with reading it outdoors on  earth during a cloudless full moon night: Albedo, Bond Albedo, Apparent Brightness, Apparent Magnitude, Geometric Albedo, Lux, or something else?
