What is the line of light in galaxy cluster MACS J1206?

I noticed this in a thread from world building, what is the continuous line of light in MACS J1206 slightly right of center in this picture? The only thing I could think of would be the side view of a galaxy, but it's much longer than any other galaxies pictured.
