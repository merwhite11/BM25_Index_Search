How do comets' nuclei stick together?

Comets are commonly called icy dust balls or dirty snowballs and as such rather light:

Known comets have been estimated to have an average density of $0.6 {\rm g}/{\rm cm}^3$. Because of their low mass, comet nuclei do not become spherical under their own gravity and therefore have irregular shapes.

I read about their live times, I learned that they can rotate, how they can be classified by their type. NASA summarizes the key facts as follows

Comets are frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system composed of dust, rock and ices. They range from a few miles to tens of miles wide, but as they orbit closer to the sun, they heat up and spew gases and dust into a glowing head that can be larger than a planet. This material forms a tail that stretches millions of miles.

What interests me has to do with their formation. I know that comets are not spherical and rather small in size. I am now wondering how comets' nuclei stick together, more specifically if there is some empiral knowledge or even some theory I should know about. Obviously, gravitation is not strong enough, so it must be merely the structural stability of the material, but how can that be estimated?
