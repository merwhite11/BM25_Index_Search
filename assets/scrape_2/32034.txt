Line of lights moving in a straight line, with a few following

My husband and I have just seen a line of about 15 lights moving in a straight line, quite high above the cloud level with a gap, and then 5 lights, a gap, another few, a gap, 1 light, a gap, and a few more.
They were moving at the same sort of speed as I would expect a plane to move at - almost like a train in the sky with a banner flying behind. They were in the sky for at least a minute. 
I had seen a shooting star a few minutes before and it wasn’t one of them... what could it be?
Could it be Elon Musk’s satellites?
