What is this, red, blue, white twinkling, star?

I am from Germany and at 11 PM I was outside and I saw a star, rapidly twinkling in blue, red and white. At first, I thought it was a plane, but it didn't move.
I took a picture of it, but you can only see a blue-ish dot on the photo.
I am from Germany and the star was in a north-east direction and it's currently around 12 at night.
Here is a photo I took of the star:

This one is for the direction of the star. It's in the circle you can see there,  all of the large stars in the photo are from an app-generated an overlay.
