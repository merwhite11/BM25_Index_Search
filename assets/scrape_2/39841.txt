Relation between mass of gas, mass of stars and dark matter halo mass

As we all know that Mass of the galaxy can be written as the sum of the mass of gas(Mg), the mass of stars (Ms), and mass of dark matter halo(Mh), as
M(galaxy)=Mg+Mh+Ms,
But is there any formula which relates Mg and Mh and, Mh and Ms??
Does anybody know?
