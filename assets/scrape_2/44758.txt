What exactly is the orbital period value of Sirius binary star system?

My Textbook An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics 2nd edition (2017), page 557 mentions that the modern value is 49.9 years. But Wikipedia mentions 50.1284Â±0.0043 years.
Which is correct? Or, has the orbital period value changed and what Wikipedia mentions is the updated value?
