Simulating Light Curve with the Timmer & Koenig method in Python

How to simulate the light curve using the Timmer & Koenig method in python with error bars in each counts generated by that method. I have used astro ML but I doesn't show the error in the counts. Any help would be highly appreciated. Is there any other library in python which can do so? Thank you in advance.
